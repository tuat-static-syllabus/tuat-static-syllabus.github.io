Hilgard (1833-1916) said. We have been looking at and dealing with complex phenomena and complex interactions are always behind our problems to be solved. This course aims to introduce fundamental knowledge of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory for green clean food technology. This course consists of four sections. The first section is introduction of theory of nonlinear dynamics and chaos. The second section demonstrates its application to agriculture. In the third section, we learn how to analyze complex data based on nonlinear time series analysis tools. The last section is a seminar given by UC Davis faculty to discuss how to apply nonlinear dynamics concepts to the topic.","expected_learning":"Understanding the concept of nonlinear dynamics.
