Each professor will give us updated and latest knowledge and technique for understanding the processes and prediction for water, sediment, and nutrient in lands and rivers. Topics for developing sustainable resources management will be included.\n\nLocation：2N402 (2nd building 4th floor) or 2nd Lecture room 3F-31, Fuchu campus\n\nSchedule\nLecture #1 November 12 (90 minutes×２) Kirstin Bunte\nIntroduction of sediment dynamics in rivers\nLecture #2 November 13(90 minutes ×1) Kirstin Bunte\nMethod for monitoring the sediment dynamics\nLecture #3 November 14 (90 minutes ×1) Kirstin Bunte\nEvaluating the sediment dynamics and river management\nLecture #4 December 2 (90 minutes×２) Julien Tournebize\nIntroduction of water quality and its evaluation\nLecture #5 December 4 (90 minutes×２) Julien Tournebize\nWater quality mitigation using bufferzone for the nutrient and pesticide\nLecture #6 January 15 (90 minutes×２) Liyantono\nIntroduction of watershed hydrology with Remote Sensing Analysis\nLecture #7 January 22 (90 minutes×２) Liyantono\nHydrological application for modeling and prediction of landuse changes\n\nBrief introduction of visiting professor\nDr. Kirstin Bunte\nDr. Krisin Bunte is a research engineer focusing on sediment dynamics and fluvial geomorphology in Colorado State University, USA. She obtained Ph.D. of physical geography in Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany. She has been working on improving monitoring technique for bedload sediment in mountain revers. She also focuses on patterns of sediment movement for changes in river morphology.\n\nCourse description\nThe lecture by Dr. Bunte includes introduction of sediment movement in streams and rivers. She will explain processes and mechanisms how, where and when sediment can be mobilized. She also explores how we can evaluate the sediment movement in a given condition around the world. Discussion in the lecture will be extended toward river and watershed management and conservation.\n\nDr. Julien Tournebize\nDr. Julien Tournebize is Research Engineer and the team leader of Attenuation, Mitigation, Transfer and Modelling of Pollutant in HydroSystems Section in Irstea, France. He has received Doctor degree in Physics at University of Strasbourg in 2001. After, He worked as Research Engineer in Cemagref which is former institution of Irestea. He has been mainly worked for the aria of pollutant fate and transport and mitigation in aquatic ecosystem.\n\nCourse description:\nThe lecture content by Dr. Tournebize includes regarding general water quality issue in agricultural drainage and wetland ecosystem. Other issues are the water quality mitigation using buffer zone in terms of nitrate and pesticides. Functions and roles of vegetative buffer zone for reducing pollutant concentration entering streams and aquatic ecosystem will be presented.\n\n\nDr. Liyantono\nDr. Liyantono is an associate professor in Bogor Agricultural University. He obtained Ph.D. in United Graduate School of Agriculture Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan. He focused modeling and remote sensing approaches for rice field and water resources management. He specified for using soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model for water and soil conservation from paddy to watershed scales. His focuses extends to economical evaluation and environmental conservation.\n\nCourse description\nThe lecture included general aspects of watershed hydrology, field and remote sensing approaches, and managements. His lectures will also include modeling and prediction of land use changes in watershed scales. Bridging between science and social implementation can be included in this lecture.\n\n連絡先 Contact\nFor lecture by Dr. Bunte：Takashi Gomi, gomit@cc.tuat.ac.jp\nFor lecture by Dr. Tournebize：Hirozumi Watanabe, pochi@cc.tuat.ac.jp\nFor lecture by Dr. Liyantono：Tasuku Kato, taskkato@cc.tuat.ac.jp","prerequisites":"予習・復習を参考資料や配布資料で実施すること。","texts_and_materials":"講義時の資料を参照","assessment":"授業への参加態度および各先生の課題・レポートなどを総合して評価する。","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"随時","remarks_1":"連絡先 Contact\nOIKAWA Yosei: yosei@cc.tuat.ac.jp","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"英語","taught_language":"","last_update":"2023/03/07 20:10:35","name":{"id":482,"ja":"特許法","en":"Patent Law"},"instructor":{"id":237,"ja":"高田 秀重, 水川 薫子","en":"TAKADA Hideshige, MIZUKAWA Kaoruko"},"present_lang":{"id":1,"lang_name":"日本語","lang_code":"ja"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学府","category":"","department":"","semester":"前学期","course_type":"前学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部附属広域都市圏フィールドサイエンス教育研究センター","office":"","day_period":"集中","references":"講義中に紹介"}}
