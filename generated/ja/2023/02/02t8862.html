Specifically, the receiver has to detect the transmitted signal and estimate the channel response based on the received signal. In this lecture, we will study not only the essential things related to wireless communications but also basic things related to estimation and detection. The received signals in wireless communication include randomness and we have to employ statistical signal processing to achieve appropriate detection and estimation.\nIn this class, we will study the estimation problem and techniques.\n\nGoogle classroom code: 3mlww6y","expected_learning":"Understand detection and estimation problems, the appropriate criterion of detector and estimator designs, and practical methods to achieve them.","course_schedule":"Basics for wireless communication\n--- Detection part ---\n1.
