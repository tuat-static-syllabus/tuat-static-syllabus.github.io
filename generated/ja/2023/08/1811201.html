The seminars are centered on discussion and laboratory work under the supervision of three research supervisors. Students will finalize their research plan as well as improve their competency through seminars and laboratory work at the research laboratory of the principal supervisor.\nIn the process, students are expected to recognize the relationship and relevance of their research theme with related fields of study. Students are also expected to acquire a diverse academic perspective, which is essential in sustainability research, and understand the usefulness of learning and conceptualization methods used in other disciplines. In order to instill an interdisciplinary perspective centered on their doctoral dissertation theme, students will hold discussions from various perspectives with students taking Interdisciplinary Seminar I to IV, and learn knowledge and approaches to analysis and social implementation in other fields.","expected_learning":"Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to:\n- enhance core competency in their doctoral dissertation research field.\n- explain the purpose and significance of their research in relation to current research trends.\n- refine their doctoral research by accelerating each aspect of research, namely, comprehension, analysis and implementation, through discussions with the assistant supervisors.\n- acquire consensus-building skills and the capacity to adapt to diverse value systems and environments.\n- leverage new ideas, knowledge, and information obtained through meaningful academic exchanges with researchers not only in their specialized fields but also from other disciplines, into the design of their doctoral dissertation research.\n","course_schedule":"The principal supervisor will coordinate with the assistant supervisors to hold regular seminars in each of their laboratories. Remote lecture systems or other media may be used as necessary.\nStudents will hold group reading and discussion of important previous research in their specialized fields and other related fields to enhance their competency. In particular, students are expected to acquire the capability to adapt to the various problems that arise during the conduct of their research/experiment as well as to the countermeasures to those problems, and to recognize the significance and originality of their research in relation to previous studies, while incorporating the results of discussions in the seminars into their daily laboratory work and research activities. At the same time, discussions with the principal supervisor and the two co-supervisors will be held to train students to clearly explain the academic contributions of their research, as well as to improve their doctoral dissertation research plans in consideration of opinions of faculty members in other disciplines. Students are expected to actively engage in discussions with the assistant supervisors and research laboratory members and in communicating their own experience, analytical approach, and ideas.\nAt the end of the course, students will prepare to present their research concept and implementation plan for the collaborative humanities and sciences colloquium as part of the “Advanced Practicum in Sustainability Research III” Course.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"To be decided upon discussion with students at the start of the class.","assessment":"Participation and contribution 100%","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Tuesdays: 3pm-5pm, or email: department@go.wt-jdpsr.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"英語","taught_language":"","last_update":"2023/04/24 13:10:01","name":{"id":720,"ja":"生命工学実験Ⅲ","en":"Experiment for Biotechnology and Life Science Ⅲ"},"instructor":{"id":677,"ja":"黒田 裕, 野口 恵一, 太田 善浩","en":"KURODA Yutaka, NOGUCHI Keiichi, OHTA Yoshihiro"},"present_lang":{"id":1,"lang_name":"日本語","lang_code":"ja"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"工学府博士","category":"前期課程科目","department":"","semester":"後学期","course_type":"後学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部附属家畜病院","office":"","day_period":"集中","references":"To be distributed and introduced in each class."}}
