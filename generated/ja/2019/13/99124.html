In Japan, forest resources have grown mature and are sully ready for harvest, while productivity of forestry remains at a low level, particularly due to structural characteristics of small-scaled forest ownership dominance as well as inadequate coordination and consolidation of forestry practices among different forest owners, under-development of forestry road networks, and slow adoption of efficient log production systems. This lecture, therefore, introduces an urgent challenge to transform forestry into a growth industry so that forestry can contribute to development of rural areas in a sustainable manner.\n\nProf.Yokota\n1. “Researches on proteomics and metabolomics in trees”\n2. “Proteomics” is a research field on comprehensive analyses of proteins that are synthesized by the genomic information in organisms. “Metabolomics” is a research field on comprehensive analyses of metabolites that are biosynthesized or degraded by proteins, mostly enzymes, synthesized in organisms. Researches on proteomics and metabolomics are actively being carried out through the world as post-genomics researches, and they are remarkably under development in medical and pharmaceutical fields. In contrast, these researches on plants are rather undeveloped, especially those on trees are much less developed. However, these researches on trees are steadily undergoing mostly in tree pathology.\n3. This lecture deals with the following topics: basic concepts on proteomics and metabolomics, instrumental analyses for proteomics and metabolomics, researches on proteomics and metabolomics for plants, and researches on proteomics and metabolomics for trees.\n","expected_learning":"Prof.Aruga\nIn order to promote the sustainable forest management, a better understanding about the forest and forestry in Japan will be achieved.\nProf.Yokota\nUnderstanding the research trends of proteomics and metabolomics in trees.","course_schedule":"Prof.Aruga\nThis course is composed of the following four themes.\n1. Introduction of innovative techniques and technologies for transforming forestry into growth industry\n2. Forest management and conservation\n3. Forestry and rural mountain communities\n4.
