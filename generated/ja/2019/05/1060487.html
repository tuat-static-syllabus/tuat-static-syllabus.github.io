In this lecture, we will develop the concept and consider the diffusion equilibrium between systems in which the number of particles can be freely exchanged. As a preparation, we understand entropy and free energy of Helmholtz, and treat solar spectrum and binary alloys as application examples. Altitude change of atmospheric pressure, p-n junctions will be discussed as an application example of diffusion equilibrium.","expected_learning":"You will gain an understanding of the advances of Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, and will be able to explain the details of the course content summarized below.","course_schedule":"Lecture 1: Introduction\nYou are responsible to check your fundamental knowledge of thermodynamics. Course instructors will explain the outline of this lecture as follows.\nThermal equilibrium → thermal equilibrium condition → temperature → Boltzmann distribution → partition function → Helmholtz free energy\nDiffusion equilibrium → Diffusion equilibrium condition → Chemical potential → Gibbs distribution → Gibbs sum\n\nLecture 2: Thermal equilibrium and temperature\nInstructors will review how to count the number of states, and define the entropy and temperature of the system.\n\nLecture 3: Planck's law\nThe Planck distribution is derived from the entropy of free particles.\n\nLecture 4: Black body radiation\nInstructors will explain solar light spectrum based on Planck's radiation formula and mode density of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nLecture 5: Partition function and Helmholtz free energy\nInstructors will calculate Helmholtz free energy, and you are expected to understand that it gives equilibrium conditions in a system at a constant temperature.\n\nLecture 6: Entropy of mixing\nInstructors will calculate the entropy of mixing and the energy of mixing in a binary alloy.\n\nLecture 7: Binary alloys\nInstructors will calculate Helmholtz free energy in binary alloys, and you are expected to understand the phase equilibrium and phase separation of the alloys.\n\nLecture 8: Ideal gas\nInstructors will calculate the distribution function of the ideal gas, and derive the internal energy and equation of state therefrom.\n\nLecture 9: Chemical potential\nInstructors will explain the concept of diffusion equilibrium, and you are expected to understand that diffusion equilibrium conditions are represented by physical quantities called chemical potentials, just as the physical quantity representing thermal equilibrium conditions is temperature.\n\nLecture 10: Atmospheric pressure change due to altitude in the stratosphere\nAs an example of diffusion equilibrium, the altitude change of atmospheric pressure in the ideal gas is derived from the chemical potential of the ideal gas.\n\nLecture 11: Fermi and Bose statistics\nGibbs factor and Gibbs sum in diffusion equilibrium, in the same manner as Boltzmann factor and partition function in thermal equilibrium, are calculated and applied to fermi and Bose particles.\n\nLecture 12: Carrier concentration in semiconductor\nA graph of Fermi-Dirac distribution will be drawn to explain its physical meaning in detail. Calculate the total number of particles by summing the Fermi distribution, and understand the number of carriers in the semiconductor.\n\nLecture 13: p-type and n-type semiconductors\nInstructors will explain the Fermi-Dirac distribution under conditions where the negative charge and the positive charge cannot be neutralized, and derive the chemical potential that appears in the Fermi-Dirac distribution function.\n\nLecture 14: p-n junction\nInstructors will explain that a potential difference is necessary for carrier diffusion equilibrium to occur across the contact interface between the p-type and n-type semiconductors. The resulting rectification of the diode will be introduced.\n\nLecture 15: Summary, general exercises\nThe whole set of lectures will be summarized and the level of comprehension will be measured.","prerequisites":"Review homework will be distributed for each lecture. At the beginning of the next lecture, we shall check the student’s comprehension level by giving a quiz related to the previous lecture.","texts_and_materials":"Thermal Physics\nCharles Kittel and Herbert Kroemer","assessment":"A review test of the previous lecture will be conducted at the beginning of each lecture.\nOne mid-term and one final exam will be conducted.\nTotal value of quizzes, 60%; mid-term exam, 20%; final-term exam, 20%.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Contact via email.
