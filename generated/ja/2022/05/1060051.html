The course is divided into three blocks,. each taught by a different instructor.\n\nThe first block explores the visual language of images. Students learn how to “read” or “interpret” images by analyzing films and comparing them with drama texts, and understand how the development of technology is connected with cultural expression.\n\nIn the second block, students are introduced to the language of phenomenology, the philosophy of experience and consciousness, and learn to think about culture in the sense of human creation, including engineering processes, from a new perspective.\n\nThe third block gives an overview of theories of linguistic reference, or how language connects to the world. Students learn how language as a tool for understanding shapes our view of the world and how this relates to cultural differences.\n\nPlease register to class cnad2r4 in Google classroom.","expected_learning":"Students will attain basic knowledge of visual interpretation, phenomenology, and linguistic reference. Students will be able to apply this knowledge to independently analyze examples from these three fields.\n\nThis way of thinking of “language” as a mode of understanding the world and creating “culture” is expected to lead to a deeper understanding of different ways of thinking and help students to see familiar problems from new angles, leading to new ways of solving such problems.","course_schedule":"1.
