It describes operation of p-n junctions and metal-semiconductor junctions. It extends this knowledge to descriptions of bipolar and field effect transistors, and other microelectronic basic devices. This course is intended for graduate students who plan to study in the area of electronics or just have an interest in that area. This course emphasizes the fundamentals of materials and device operation. It is expected that the students taking this course will include EE and non-EE majors. The EE students have likely had an undergraduate course in solid-state devices whereas the non-majors should have some background in fundamentals of mechanics, electricity and magnetism and perhaps quantum mechanics. In this course, we will study semiconductor devices from a fundamental point of view emphasizing a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of device operation. It is expected that students who successfully complete the course will have an understanding of basic semiconductor devices sufficient to design transistors and diodes to particular specifications.","expected_learning":"The general goal of this course is to allow the students to understand the fundamentals of semiconductor behavior and the operation of basic semiconductor devices. By the end of the course, the students will be able to design diodes and transistors to a given set of specifications. Additionally, this course lays the foundations for the understanding of a vast array of other more advanced semiconductor devices such as those covered in more advanced courses.","course_schedule":"1.
