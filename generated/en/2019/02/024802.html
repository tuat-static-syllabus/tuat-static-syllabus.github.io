I would like you to understand that it is necessary to consider a wide variety of things in order to complete large-scale and complicated software systems as usable ones and to continue using them.\n\nAlso, I hope that the knowledge acquired in this class will be used in \"system development experiment\" in the second half of the third year and the \"graduation research\" in the fourth year to establish knowledge. Furthremore, for those who plan to work in the IT industry in the future, it will help to identify their position.","course_keywords":"Problem definition, problem solving process, project management, requirement analysis, software architecture design, user interface design, software module design, software test, maintenance, software reuse","office_hours":"From 10:00 to 12:00 on Monday.
