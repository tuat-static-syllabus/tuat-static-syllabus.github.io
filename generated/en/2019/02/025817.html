Especially, information processing systems have grown to be complex, which requires systematic method to analyze the requirements, design, implementation, testing, and operation. In this course, various method in requirement analysis and functional design are introduced.\n\nIn this class, a group work is performed.\n\nThis class is offered by a lecturer who has a practical experience in industry regarding software development and shows examples in a company.","expected_learning":"- Can explain the definition of system, objects, problems and issues\n- Can explain the notion of ubiquitous computing with emphasis on the relationship with system engineering\n- Can explain the problem solving process\n- Can explain the requirement analysis\n- Can explain the idea generation support\n- Can explain the problem structure analysis, e.g., ISM\n- Can explain the system modeling\n- Can explain the alternative selection methods, e.g., AHP\n- Can explain the reliable system architecture\n- Can explain the relevant technologies for ubiquitous computing, e.g., location systems\nThis class falls under the Department of Engineering Diploma Policy (B).","course_schedule":"1.
