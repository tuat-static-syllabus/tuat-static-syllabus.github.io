In this course, we will learn about differentiation and integration of multivariable functions, such as partial differentiations, criteria of local maxima and minima, double and triple integrations, volumes of solids, line integrations and series. Various computations will be practiced with drawing diagrams.\nNobutaka Nakazono will be in charge of this course.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiation and integration of two, or multivariable functions, and\n(2) to be capable of performing practical computations.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps\n","course_schedule":"1. Limits and continuity of functions of two variables\n2. Partial differentiations and total differentiations\n3. Higher order partial differentiations, and partial differentiations of composite functions\n4. Taylor’s theorem for functions of two variables\n5. Local maxima and minima of functions of two variables\n6. Review, and midterm examination\n7. Double integrations\n8. Changes of variables\n9. Triple integrations, and changes of variables by using the system of polar coordinates\n10. Improper integrations\n11. Volumes of solids and areas of surfaces\n12. Line integrations and Green's theorem\n13. Series and power series 1\n14. Series and power series 2\n15.
