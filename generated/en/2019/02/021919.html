We will learn various basic properties of a basis and the dimension of a vector space, and the image and the kernel of a linear map. We will also learn about an eigenvalue and an eigenvector, for deep understanding of linear algebra.\n\nNobuharu Sawada (a part time lecturer) will be in charge of this course.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to understand vector spaces, linear maps, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, inner products and diagonalization, and\n(2) to be capable of performing their practical calculations.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.
