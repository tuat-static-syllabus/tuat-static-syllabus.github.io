Spectroscopy, which is based on the quantum mechanics, is widely used in the many scientific fields such as the material productions. In this lecture, you will learn the basic principle of quantum mechanics as well as the fundamental about the quantum theory of translation, vibration, and rotation of molecules. Then you can understand the nature of quantum chemistry and spectroscopic principles of atoms and molecules. Therefore, this lecture is belong to the basis courses of the curriculum policy, which is a first step to learn the contents of the advanced courses such as \"Quantum chemistry II\" and \"Structural chemistry\"\n\n[Contents] We begin with a few historical experiments which were important to a birth of the quantum mechanics. Next you will learn the basic topic of the quantum mechanics such as wavefunction, Hamilton operator, and Schroedinger equation as well as the mathematical tools to understand these topics. Then you will learn the basic theories on translational, vibrational and rotational motions to understand the principal concepts of spectroscopy and quantum chemistry on atoms and molecules.\n","expected_learning":"This course aims the next four items for the expected learning by referring the diploma policy A, getting the basic skills about the natural science.\n(1) You can understand the difference of physical description in classical mechanics and quantum mechanics.\n(2) You can understandi of the wavefunction, Hamilton operator, and Schroedinger equation.\n(3) You and derive and calculate the Schroedinger equation in simple cases, then find the corresponding wavefunction and energy level.\n(4) You can understand of the quantization of the translational, vibrational and rotational energies. Then you can solve the mathematical exercises for these topics.\n","course_schedule":"1.
