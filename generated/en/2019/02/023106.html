After the introduction, we discuss various global environmental issues, deepen their understanding by discussing topics such as the following in groups and discussing. In addition, Dr. Nishimura and Dr. Kidoshi will provide cutting-edge topics from their respective specialist standpoints. It is aimed at grasping the actual situation of global environmental problems and solutions based on an engineering approach and acquiring the environmental consciousness and the foundation of environmental technology. I would like to ask students who actively participate in the discussion.\nTasks and technologies to be covered in this lecture\nGlobal warming problem, desertification, eutrophication and depletion of phosphorus, energy problem, bioethanol and biodiesel, wind power generation, heat pump, LED, solar cell, environmental pollution by chemical substances, sewage treatment, garbage disposal, hybrid car and Electric car\n","expected_learning":"Acquire the ability to understand the essence of various issues related to the global environment and to consider it scientifically.\nThis subject corresponds to the viewpoint C of the diploma policy.\n","course_schedule":"Apr 15th (Mon) 6th period at 304 room on 3rd floor of 10th building\nIntroduction (YOHDA)\nIf you are unable to attend, please contact the employees via e-mail. Do another introduction in a schedule.\nThe lecture schedule after that will be announced on this day.\n\nJuly to August\nResearch study (YOHDA)\n\nTBA（Sat）2-5 Periods\nDr. Kidohshi (The Japan Research Institute)\n1. Trends in countermeasures against global warming\nWith the Great East Japan Earthquake, Japan's energy has undergone a major change in the direction of low carbonization. I will introduce the current trend of low carbonization from the current trend of global warming countermeasures.\n2. Technologies for coping with global warming\nSpecifically, how to realize low carbonization will be outlined for each individual technology.\n3. Specific examples of renewable energy business\nRenewable energy is local energy for local production. It is necessary to create a mechanism to use region-specific energy sources in the region. Here, we will introduce the process by taking the biogas business as an example.\n4. Environmental cities in the world\nIn the world, efforts are under way to create a sustainable world that introduces local energy on a large scale in cities. We will introduce the status of the initiatives, the challenges and the policy of the solution. Also, I will explain what is required for future low carbon society.\n\nDr. Nishimura (EnBioEngineering Co.)\nJune 1st (Sat) 3-5 period\n1. Structural understanding of global environmental problems and chemical substance problems\nStructurally organize the overall picture of global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain, disappearance of tropical forests, desertification, marine pollution, waste transboundary movement, and biodiversity, as well as their fundamental causes of harmful I will explain the problem of chemical substances.\n2. Application of biotechnology to environmental field\nI will explain the fields where biotechnology can be applied to solve the global environment problem.\n3. An outline of soil groundwater pollution and an overview of countermeasure technology\nAs one of the specific fields to which biotechnology can be applied, I will explain the current situation of soil groundwater contamination problem and general countermeasure technology including physicochemical techniques and explain the features of biological method (bioremediation).\n4. Bioremediation\nI will explain technical overview, current situation and problem of bioremediation, forefront of research and future prospects.\n\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Report 40%, Research study 60%.","message_from_instructor":"？Let's study the latest information and technology on global environmental issues together.\n","course_keywords":"Desertification, eutrophication, bioethanol, biodiesel, heat pump, environmental pollution by chemical substances, biogas, bioremediation","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/4/2019 11:35:50 AM","name":{"id":715,"ja":"地球環境工学","en":"Earth Environmental Engineering"},"instructor":{"id":678,"ja":"西村 実, 木通 秀樹, 養王田 正文","en":"NISHIMURA Minoru, KIDOHSHI Hideki, YOHDA Masafumi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":6,"min":2,"max":3},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"","day_period":"集中","references":""}}
