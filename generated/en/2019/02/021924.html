In this course we introduce the notion of an abstract vector space as a generalization of the space of plane or space vectors, as well as a linear map between two vector spaces, which is studied with its matrix represetation. In particular, we will learn about basic properties and computation of a basis and the dimension of a vector space, the image and kernel of a linear map. We also learn about the concepts and methods of eigen values and eigen spaces, diagonalization, and metric spaces, aiming at better understanding of linear algebra.\n","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is:\n1) to understand basic notions of vector spaces, linear maps, linear independence and bases\n2) to be able to calculate (bases of) the image and kernel of a linear map given by a matrix\n3) to be able to calculate the representation matrix of a linear map with respect to given bases\n4) to be able to calculate the eigen values and eigen spaces of a square matrix and determine whether it is diagonalizable\n5) to be able to calculate an ortho-normalizion of a given basis of a metric space\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps","course_schedule":"1.
