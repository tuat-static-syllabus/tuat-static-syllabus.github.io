In this course, we will learn the differentiations and the integrations of various functions of one variable and their properties. We will practice advanced computations in this course rather than in high schools.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiations and the integrations of various functions, such as polynomials, rational and irrational functions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions,\n(2) to understand how to calculate extreme maximal and minimum values of functions, and\n(3) to be capable of performing practical computations on determining areas of figures and lengths of curves.","course_schedule":"1. Sequence and its limit\n2. Limit and continuousness of a function\n3,4,5. Differential of a function\n6,7,8. Indefinite integral and definite integral\n9,10. Improper integral\n11,12. Applications of calculus\n13,14. Summary\n\nThe midterm exam will be held at the sixth or seventh class, and the unified exam will be held at the end of a semester. I will let you know the detailed schedule during class.\n","prerequisites":"Mathematics in high schools (in particular, Mathematics I, II, III etc.) will be used in the lecture.","texts_and_materials":"Makoto Nanba, Bibun-Sekibun-Gaku, SHOKABO Co., Ltd.
