This course aims to understand drugs from the viewpoint of reactivity of organic compounds (drugs) with proteins and nucleic acids.\n<Outline> In this course, synthesis and reaction of carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones), which are frequently used for the synthesis of drugs, are addressed. In addition, we will introduce the latest technique on computer-assisted drug design. We also will address sugars, amino acids, and nucleic acids for understanding the mode of actions of medicines. In each lecture, home work is assigned which is related to the contents of the lecture. Through this course, you will learn about the electron arrows to understand the reaction.\n","expected_learning":"1) Understand the synthetic methods of some drugs based upon the reactions of carbonyl compounds.\n2) Understand the computer-assisted drug design strategies.\n3) Understand the chemical structures and reactivity of carbohydrates, nucleic acids and amino acids.\n\nThis subject corresponds to the viewpoint A of the diploma policy.\n","course_schedule":"1.
