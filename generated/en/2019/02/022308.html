This course provides basic knowledge and concept in organic chemistry systematically, following Organic Chemistry I and II. The topics covered in this course are chemistry of alkynes and allylic and aromatic compounds with carbon-carbon multiple bond(s) and carbonyl compound such as aldehydes and ketones.","expected_learning":"Aromatic compounds and carbonyl compounds covered in this course is an important class of compounds in synthetic organic chemistry. Students will acquire the knowledge and skills to design the synthetic route to simple organic molecules by understanding a various type of carbon-carbon bond forming reactions and functional-group transformation and reaction mechanisms of them.","course_schedule":"This course will cover Chapters 13~18 in the text. The approximate order of topics to be covered is given below.\n\n[Weeks 1 and 2]\nOrientation\nChapter 13 Alkynes: Properties and spectroscopy of alkynes, Preparation of alkynes, Reaction of alkynes (alkynyl anions, reduction and electrophilic addition of alkynes)\n\n[Weeks 3 and 4]\nChapter 14: Delocalized Pi system: Properties and spectroscopy of allyl and conjugated-diene compounds, Reaction of allylic and diene compounds (substitution via radical mechanism, nucleophilic substitution, allylation, Diels-Alder reaction, electrocyclic reaction)\n\n[Weeks 5, 6, and 7]\nBenzene and Aromaticity: Aromaticity, Huckel’s rule, Properties and spectroscopy of aromatic compounds, electrophilic aromatic substitution, Friedel-Crafts reaction)\n\n[Week 8]\nSummary and Midterm exam\n\n[Weeks 9 and 10]\nChapter 16 Electrophilic attack on derivatives of benzene: Effect of substituents on electrophilic aromatic substitution\n\n[Weeks 11, ans 12]\nThe lectures will be given on the basis that you have taken Organic Chemistry I and II and understood the course contents.\nChapter 17 Aldehydes and Ketones: Properties and spectroscopy of aldehydes and ketones, Preparation of aldehydes and ketones, reaction of aldehydes and ketones (acetalization, conversion to imines and enamines, oxidation, reduction, Wittig reaction)\n\n[Weeks 13 and 14]\nChapter 18 Enols, Enolates, and the Aldol condensation: keto-enol tautomerization, reaction on alpha-carbon, aldol condensation, Michael addition, Robinson annulation)\n\n[Week 15]\nSummary and Final exam","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Organic Chemistry: Structure and Function 7th edition\nPeter Vollhardt, Neil E.
