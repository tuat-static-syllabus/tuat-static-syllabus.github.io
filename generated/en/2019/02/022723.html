The student will own the theoretical and systematic knowledge of the instrumentation for engineering measurements including its methodology, configuration, operating principle and property, whose objective is to collect the quantitative information yielded by the physical real world phenomena with the use of the artificial measurement instrument.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n・Get basic ideas of measurements and the errors associated with measurement.\n・Design of electronic circuit for the measurement of sensor output electrical signals (voltage, current, resistance, impedance).\n・Gain an knowledge and ability to interpret principles, precisions and limitations of the various electronic measurement techniques in practical use in engineering.","course_schedule":"1. Basic of measurement\n2. Measurement error and its treatment\n3. Unit (history of SI unit, traceability)\n4. Signal transformation\n5. Signal and noise\n6. Operational amplifier\n7. Direct current and voltage measurement\n8. Intermediate examination\n9. Resistance measurement\n10. Alternative current and voltage, and power measurement\n11. Impedance measurement\n12. System response and spectrum\n13. Measurement of waveform\n14. Analog and digital signal\n15. Final examination","prerequisites":"Students entering this class are assumed to have had basics of electrical and electronic circuits.","texts_and_materials":"We will use the teaching materials posted on the web:\nhttp://yamada.readymade.jp/keisoku/keisoku.html","assessment":"Class contribution: weekly small test is worth 10% of your grade.\nExams: Midterm and term-end exam will be given. Each exam is worth 45% of your grade.","message_from_instructor":"The emphasis is not on understanding as mere knowledge (it is useless to know only the mechanical memorization before the exam is useless), but emphasizing the idea that leads to understanding and leads to conclusion rather than final conclusion. For this reason, I am going to ask questions in the essay style. Questions are also accepted from time to time, so I would like you to study hard.","course_keywords":"Electrical and electronic measurement, analog and digital, voltage, current, impedance, frequency, waveform and spectrum, signal and noise","office_hours":"On demand.","remarks_1":"The initial schedule may be changed due to circumstances. Even in that case, as a rule, we do not change the schedule of midterm exams and final exams, so please prepare for this day. If you can not take the exam (unforeseen accident or illness) due to unavoidable circumstances, certain considerations may be made, provided that the following conditions are met.\n1 Report immediately after the examination, 2 Attach objectively certifiable material (in case of illness, doctor's certificate)","remarks_2":"The distribution of grades over the past 10 years is as follows:\nH30(2018) S13.6% A18.5% B24.3% C26.2% D11.6% E5.8%\nH29(2017) S10.1% A21.1% B29.3% C26.3% D10.1% E3.0%\nH28(2016) S18.4% A31.0% B20.7% C19.5% D5.8% E4.6%\nH27(2015) S11.3% A15.0% B22.5% C30.0% D16.3% E5.0%\nH26(2014) S20.8% A22.1% B24.7% C20.8% D9.1% E2.6%\nH25(2013) S17.7% A25.9% B17.7% C15.3% D17.7% E5.9%\nH24(2012) S9.8% A20.7% B28.3% C25.0% D12.0% E4.4%\nH23(2011) S4.4% A21.7% B21.7% C23.2% D10.1% E18.8%\nH22(2010) S12.1% A14.3% B18.7% C25.3% D16.5% E13.2%\nH21(2009) S12.4% A12.4% B21.0% C30.5% D23.8% (About 60% of D people have not taken the exam）","related_url":"http://yamada.readymade.jp/keisoku/keisoku.html","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/10/2020 10:24:04 AM","name":{"id":691,"ja":"計測工学","en":"Instrumentation"},"instructor":{"id":657,"ja":"山田 晃","en":"YAMADA Akira"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"工学府","office":"","day_period":"月3","references":"(1) Darold Wobschall, Circuit Design for Electronic Instrumentation: Analog and Digital Devices from Sensor to Display,McGraw-Hill Inc.,US (1979/12/1)\n(2) T.H.O'Dell, Circuits for Electronic Instrumentation, Cambridge University Press; 1st Pbk.
