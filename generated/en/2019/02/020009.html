Students will experience different styles of lectures and classes depending on the contents. It consists of two parts.\n\nPart I : Common Introductory Program\nIn this program that is common to all first-year students, students will learn about our university and think how they would pursue their academic life here. The university history and TUAT principals are described as well as our research activities, with the aim of encouraging students to engage in university study and to understanding the importance of designing their individual university life.\n\nPart II : Faculty-Specific Program\nCourses in high schools are designed to make science lectures separately; physics, chemistry, biology, and archeology. In Universities, interdisciplinary studies of those fields are necessary to learn science. This course is designed for you to experience topics of science by conducting experiments, which cover diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, informatics, security, and environments. You learn how to develop your specialties with broad views through performing the experiments by own thoughts.","expected_learning":"We expect you all to learn to\n(1) To understand the autonomous learning in the University, and be able to design individual's academic life at University from broad perspectives.\n(2) Understand principles of the experiments.\n(3) Appropriately conduct the experiments from comprehension of purposes and methods of the experiments.\n(4) Analyze experimental data and make reasonable conclusions.\n(5) Lead scientific discussion from the experimental results.\n(6) Write your reports of the above items.\n\nCompetency Development：\nInitiative and Autonomy, Leadership and Facilitation, Knowledge Creation, Presentation Skills, Mission-Oriented Research and Problem Solving, Academic Ethics","course_schedule":"Part I : Common Introductory Program\n1. About the University (I)\n　　Brief history of the University. Talks from the President, the Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, and the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering.\n2. Energy-saving and Safety in university life\nGlobal warming and emission of green house gas. Our effort in reducing CO2 emission.\nRisk management in laboratories. You action to ensure own and others' safety. Risks of harmful chemicals and proper ways of their disposal.\n3. Studying at the University\n　　Differences between studying at high school and studying at university. Designing your academic life at the University from broad perspectives.\nQuestioning minds that lead you to the depth of academic study and research\n4. Research ethics\nCode of conduct for research integrity, and scientific misconducts. Falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism are discussed.\n5. Campus tour to visit the University's facilities\n　　Students visit the Nature and Science Museum of the University and other facilities.\n\nPart II : Faculty-Specific Program\n#6- Experiments\nNucleophilic substitution reaction for Alkyl halides\nEnvironmental analysis ~Inorganic qualitative analysis~\nFabrication of plastic cell\nThin-layer chromatography\nDNA analysis and Electrophoresis\nScientific criminal investigation ~Synthesis of fluorophore and observation of luminescence behavior~\nOxidation-reduction titration of vitamin C\nSynthesis of acetanilide\nResearch workshop","prerequisites":"Part I : In addition to 10 hours you spend in the class, you are recommended to review the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University for each class, to plan out the courses to take and design how you would pursue your academic activities ahead.\nPart II :Students entering this class are assumed to have had a high school experimental knowledge.","texts_and_materials":"Part I :Handouts and exercise materials are provided during the class\nPart II :Experimental text, which can be bought at the first class of the third semester.","assessment":"Part I (16%)：Marks are given based on worksheets collected at the end of each class.\nPart II (84%)：Total evaluation of \"attitude for experiments\", \"homework\", \"reports\" and \"experiment participation\". Details will be explained at the orientation.","message_from_instructor":"Experiment course is integrated course of science. The registered students should understand backgrounds and theories of each experiment by reading the instruction text and other supplementary materials in prior work, participate in the experiments, and submit reports of the corresponding experiments. Please do not attend the course aimlessly. Your active participation is expected.","course_keywords":"Part I : 　Questioning mind, Autonomous learning","office_hours":"Part I : It will be announced during the class.
