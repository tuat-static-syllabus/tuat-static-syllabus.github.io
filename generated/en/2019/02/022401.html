They are also relavent to properties of solid materials. Therefore understanding on how electrons behave in molecules or solid materials is quite important. In this lecture, we understand basics of quantum chemistry.","expected_learning":"The followings should be understood.\n1. Why do we need quantum chemistry?\n2. wave nature of electrons\n3. Schrodinger equation\n4. Chemical bondings and electrons\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"(The schedule would be changed depending on situation.)\n1. Condtradiction in classical mechanics (some examples).\n2. Schrodinger equation and wavefunction\n3. Restriction on wavefunctions. Operater and eigenfunction\n4. Superposition of wavefunctions\n5. Heisenberg uncertainty principle\n6. Wavefunction for particle in a box (1-dimensional)\n7. Tunnelling\n8. Particle in a box (2-dimensional)\n9. Rotation and quantification of orbital angular momentum\n10. Quantum numbers and orbitals of an electron\n11. Multielectron aton and Pauli principle\n12. Molecular orbital theory\n13. variation principle\n14. Huckel approximation1\n15. Huckel approximation2","prerequisites":"Students need to understand fundamentals of differencial equations, mechanics and electromagnetics。","texts_and_materials":"Physical Chemistry (eigth edition) by Peter Atkins","assessment":"Students are evaluated by the two exams and short test in each class.
