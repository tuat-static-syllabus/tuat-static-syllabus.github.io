The equipments which drives by such a sensor are widely used in factories, offices,and your home, today. A basis of these systems is two technological functions, the technology which \"measures\" the physical quantity and the technology which \"controls\" mechanical movement.\nIn this course, as an elective subject in the curriculum of applied physics, you can experience examples of the basic measurement circuits and control circuits. The automatic measurement/control system using PC will be also demonstrated.\n","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee curriculum guide.","course_schedule":"A.
