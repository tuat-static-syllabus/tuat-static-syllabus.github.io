While reviewing high school-level chemistry, classes will introduce the key principles in chemistry, which involves atomic orbitals, valence bond theory, molecular orbital theory, molecular representations, acids and bases, stereochemistry. A particular emphasis is placed on learning the structures of organic compounds, so that it will serve as an introductory course for Bioorganic Chemistry courses.\nI will make lectures on atomic orbitals, valence bond theory, molecular orbital theory according to textbooks. Practice exercises at the end of the textbooks are useful for improving the understanding on the textbooks. To remember and understand technical terms are important for being a researcher who is active around the world.\n","expected_learning":"To understand atomic orbitals, valence bond theory, molecular orbital theory.\nTo obtain an ability to discuss the relationships between the molecular structures and their physicochemical properties from the viewpoints of molecular orbital theory.\n","course_schedule":"Course schedule\n1：Orientation\n2：Atomic Structures\n3：Chemical bonds\n4：Molecular representations\n5：Acid-base reactions\n6：Atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals（１）\n7：Atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals（２）\n8: Summary of 1-7\n9：Physicochemical properties of organic compounds\n10：Structures of organic compounds\n11：Chemical reaction（１）\n12：Chemical reaction（２）\n13：Conformations of organic compounds（１）\n14：Conformations of organic compounds（２）\n15：Exam：covers materials in session 1-14\n\n","prerequisites":"This course will prepare students to study the following higher level courses such as Bioorganic ChemistryI and II, Medicinal Chemistry, Biochemistry I and II, Bioanalytical Chemistry and Bioinorganic Chemistry.","texts_and_materials":"Organic Chemistry 7th Ed.
