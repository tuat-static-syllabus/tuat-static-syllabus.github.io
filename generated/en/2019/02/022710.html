In this course, design principles from gates which are basic components to complex circuits which implement logical functions composed from basic components are described. Students can learn simplification of logic circuits from truth tables towards many kinds of state machines.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"#1: Outline of this course, binary variables and their functions, basic gates such as AND and OR gates.\n#2: Truth table, principle of Bloolean algebra.\n#3: Leading logic equations from a truth table\n#4: Simplifying logic equations from Karnough maps.\n#5: Examples of ractical circuits.\n#6: Circuits of calculating operations No.1\n#7: Circuits of calculating operations No.2\n#8: Midterm exam.\n#9: Simple Flip-Flop and kinds of Flip-Flops.\n#10: Asynchronous and synchronous sequential circuits and a clock signal.\n#11: State diagrams and state machines.\n#12: Designing sequential circuits from state diagrams.\n#13: Designing practical sequential circuits such as counters.\n#14: Examples of practical sequential circuits.\n#15: Final exam.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"K.
