Students study proteins and nucleotides, lipids, sugars during this lecture, and for understanding these subjects especially on metabolic pathways, combination of knowledge about such carbonyl compounds as amides, esters, aldehydes and amines and phosphonic acids are highly required. Thus, it is desirable for students to confirm issues already studied in previous lectures after having explanations at the class.\nIn this course, lectures are given using Microsoft PowerPoint. In each lecture, handouts are distributed.","expected_learning":"1. To understand properties, reactions and synthetic methods of amines.\n2. To understand properties, reactions and synthetic methods of bio-related substances (sugars, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids).\n3. To understand metabolic pathways from the viewpoint of the organic chemistry.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1st lecture: Guidance of this course / Chapter 24-Amine Part 1: properties of amines.\n2nd lecture: Chapter 24-Amine Part 2: reactions and synthetic methods of amines.\n3rd lecture: Chapter 24-Amine Part 3: heterocyclic amines. / Chapter 25-Sugar Part 1: classifications and stereochemistries of sugars.\n4th lecture: Chapter 25-Sugar Part 2: structures and reactions of sugars.\n5th lecture: Chapter 26-Amino Acid/Peptide/Protein Part 1: amino acids.\n6th lecture: Chapter 26-Amino Acid/Peptide/Protein Part 2: peptides and proteins\n7th lecture: Summary of 1st-6th lectures, midterm examination\n8th lecture: Chapter 27-Lipid Part 1: oils and fats, soaps, phosphatides, eicosanoids\n9th lecture: Chapter 27-Lipid Part 2: terpenoids and steroids\n10th lecture: Chapter 28-Nucleic acid\n11th lecture: Chapter 29-Organic chemistry for the metabolic pathway Part 1: Outline of metabolic pathways\n12th lecture: Chapter 29-Organic chemistry for the metabolic pathway Part 2: metabolic pathways of lipids and sugars\n13th lecture: Chapter 29-Organic chemistry for the metabolic pathway Part 3: citric acid cycle and metabolic pathways of lipids and proteins\n14th lecture: total reviews\n15th lecture: Summary of 1st-14th lectures, term examination","prerequisites":"This course is classified in technology speciality courses and provides one of the department-recommended organic chemistry subjects.\nRequire preparation and review hours recommended by this university along with school hours (30 hours).
