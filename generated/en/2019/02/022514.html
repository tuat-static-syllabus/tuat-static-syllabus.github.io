Basic theory and up-to-date technology will be presented in the class. Especially, the cutting principles grinding principles for metal, ceramics and plastics will be taught.\n1) Mechanism of shape generation using tool and mechine tool can be explained.\n2) It is possible to plan the procedure of the machining process considering the accuracy and cost using appropriate machine and tools.\n3)Physical phenomenon in the machining process can be understood","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand the form genarating mechanism by machine tools. Cutting tools and select machining tools can be selected in consideration of machining accuracy, production quantity, economy, etc. when machining certain parts. Also, the students can explain physical phenomena at machining points in cutting and grinding.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n\n","course_schedule":"1.Background of machining process\n2.High-value machining and manufacturing processes.\n3.Cutting Process 1.
