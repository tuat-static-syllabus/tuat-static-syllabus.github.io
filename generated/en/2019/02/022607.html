For example, numerical simulation plays an important role as an understanding tool of natural phenomena and as a design tool for systems and devices. Also, computers make a significant contribution in data analysis. In this lecture, firstly, students will learn about programming and numerical analysis algorithm using C language with the aim of acquiring basic knowledge of numerical analysis. Finally, students will practice the numerical simulation of physical phenomena to further understanding of calculation accuracy and calculation time.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand a basic numerical simulation on computer and an application to analysis of physical phenomena.","course_schedule":"【Programming basics (C Language)】\n1. Arithmetic operation and input / output\n2. Logic operation and conditional statement\n3. Iteration 1(for statement, Order notation)\n4.Use of function\n5. Iteration 2 (while statement, do?while statement)\n\n【Numerical solution of equation and integration method】\n6. Numerical solution of equation 1: Bisection method\n7. Numerical solution of equation 2: Newton method\n8. Numerical integration: trapezoidal formula\n9. Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations 1: Euler method, Runge-Kutta method\n10.Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations 2: Second-order ordinary differential equation\n\n【Numerical simulation】\n11.

Numerical simulation 4: Application to multi-dimensional, multi-particle Systems\n15. Numerical simulation 5: Free tasks\n","prerequisites":"It is recommended that students have learned “Basic experiment on computer”.","texts_and_materials":"Prints are distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"Report 100%. The report is evaluated with maximum point of 10. The grade is evaluated a total of 15 reports. The deadline of the report is Thursday of the week only if the task cannot be completed within the lecture. If it is submitted after the deadline, the score is subtracted by the number of days since the deadline multiplied by 1. However, if it is not submitted, the report score is 0.","message_from_instructor":"I would like students to submit reports every time since this course is exercise that students practically make program and consider the results.","course_keywords":"Programming, C Language, Algorithm, Numerical analysis, Numerical simulation","office_hours":"If you have any further questions, I will be happy to talk to you after the lecture.
