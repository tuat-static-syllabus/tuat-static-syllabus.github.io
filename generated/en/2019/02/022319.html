The lecture will be started from the serial theme of Organic chemistry III. The target compounds are aromatic compounds, aldehyde, ketone, carboxylic acid, and carboxylic acid derivatives. The lecture will focus on the nomenclature, structures, chemical/physical features, synthetic procedures and reaction. You will understand structures and chemical features of carbonyl compounds and aromatic ones and learn the transformation reaction and the relative reactivity.","expected_learning":"The level of educational achievement\nAbout carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acid derivatives, aromatic compounds, non-conjugated- and conjugated multiple bonds:\n1) You can draw the structure by systematic nomenclature\n2) You can speculate the plausible reaction from the combination of the substrate with reagents.\n3) You can explain the molecular transformation reaction behavior such as 2) with reaction equations, arrows indicated electron transfer, resonance equations, and so on.\n","course_schedule":"There is possibility of changing of the theme, however the outline is scheduled as follows:\n\nFirst half:\n1) Chemistry of aldehyde and ketone 1 (chapter 17)\nNomenclature, chemical/physical features, synthetic procedures (oxidation etc…), and overview of addition reaction of carbonyl group.\n\n2) Chemistry of aldehyde and ketone 2 (chapter 17)\nReaction (hydration, formation of acetal, imine, enamine etc…).\n\n3) Chemistry of aldehyde and ketone 3 (chapter 17)\nReaction (Clemmensen reduction, Wolff-Kishner reduction, cyanohydrin etc…).\n\n4) Chemistry of aldehyde and ketone 4 (chapter 17)\nReaction (Wittig reaction, Baeyer-Villiger reaction etc…).\n\n5) Examination-1 (lectures 1-4)\n\n6) Chemistry of carboxylic acid 1 (Chapter 19)\nNomenclature, chemical/physical features, synthetic procedures (oxidation etc…), and overview of addition reaction of carbonyl group.\n\n7) Chemistry of carboxylic acid 2 (Chapter 19)\nTransformation reaction of carboxylic acid to carboxylic acid derivatives (alkanoyl halide, acid anhydride, ester, amide etc…)\n\n8) Chemistry of carboxylic acid derivatives 1 (Chapter 20)\nNomenclature (alkanoyl halide, acid anhydride, and ester), chemical/physical features, and reaction.\n\n9) Chemistry of carboxylic acid derivatives 2 (Chapter 20)\nNomenclature (ester, amide, and nitrile), chemical/physical features, and reaction.\n\n10) Examination-2 (lectures 6-9)\n\n11) Chemistry of enol and enolate 1 (Chapter 18)\nFormation of enol and enolate. Reaction of enol and enolate with electrophiles (halogenation and alkylation).\n\n12) Chemistry of enol and enolate 2 (Chapter 18)\nAldol condensation (reaction mechanism, cross-aldol condensation, and intramolecular aldol condensation)\n\n13) Chemistry of enol and enolate 3 (Chapter 18)\nFeatures and reaction of alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde and ketone (Conjugation addition, Michael addition, and Robinson annulation)\n\n14) Chemistry of ester enolate (Chapter 23)\nClaisen condensation (reaction mechanism, mixed Claisen condensation, and Dieckmann condensation)\n\n15) Chemistry of beta-dicarbanyl compounds (Chapter 23)\nSynthetic strategies of methyl ketones and carboxylic acids by using of beta-dicarbanyl compounds as synthetic intermediates.
