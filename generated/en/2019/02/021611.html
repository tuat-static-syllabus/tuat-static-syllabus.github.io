Target\nTo get used to the world of programming using programming language c.\nTo learn the basic methods of use about compiler and development environment.\n\nb. Summary\nThis course uses \"programming language c\" that is widely used as educational material, where students start from learning the operation procedures from program creation to runing, and learn various construction to perform execution and control of processes through practices.\n\nEvery time exercises along a theme are explained and students make programs. Students can experience a simple Web browser development through this course and \"Basic Programming: Laboratory Exercises\" opened in the late period of first-year students.\n\nc.
