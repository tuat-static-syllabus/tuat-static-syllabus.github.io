In this lecture, students will learn techniques for creating and understanding drawings in electronic information engineering with practical skills. This lecture is positioned as a specialized subject in the department of electrical and electronic engineering, and learns more specialized things in electrical and electronic engineering. In making drawings, the intentions of the drawing must be completely communicated. The drawing user must be able to easily get it. In this lecture, students will learn the technology for creating drawings specified by the JIS standard. In this lecture, students will learn drawing creation technology using CAD(Computer-Aided Drafting).","expected_learning":"The aim is to learn basic drawing techniques in electronic information engineering. The aim is to learn the basic usage of CAD software in drafting. The above leads to the acquisition of basic technologies of electrical and electronic engineering as shown in viewpoint (B) in the diploma policy of the department of electrical and electronic engineering.","course_schedule":"In this lecture, the following contents are explained.\n# 1: Guidance\n#2-3: Usage of CAD soft and exercises\n#4-6: Projections used in CAD soft and exercises\n#7-9: Letters and lines used in CAD soft and exercises\n#10-11: Symbols used in CAD soft and exercises\n#12-13: Practical drafting in electronics information and exercises\n#14: Summary\n#15: Confirmation of understanding\n\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"「これからはじめるAutoCadの本」(技術評論社 稲葉幸行著), In Japanese","assessment":"We will assign some problems each class","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Drafting, Drawing, Electrical and electronic engineering, CAD, Projection, JIS","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/10/2020 11:21:57 AM","name":{"id":2121,"ja":"電子情報工学製図","en":"Electronic Information Drafting"},"instructor":{"id":1567,"ja":"髙根沢 真","en":"TAKANEZAWA Makoto"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":10,"min":4,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
