Through these examples, we can easily understand control meaning.\n(2)Representation of controlled system: Natural phenomena can be described by a differential equation. In the control engineering, its equation is reduced to an algebraic operation through Laplace transformation. We treat Laplace transformation.\n(3)Time response: By using the block diagram, representation method is investigated and then introducing method of the time response is also investigated.\n(4)Frequency response 1: We treat a manipulation for the frequency response. From the frequency response, it is easily to recall the time response.\n(5) Frequency response 2: Especially, we handle Bode diagram. Physical meaning of Bode diagram and drawing method are very important.\n(6)Stability of controlled system: Stability analysis is important for the closed control system. Routh ?Hurwitz stability condition is investigated.\n(7)For midterm examination: We carry out exercises for midterm examination.\n(8)Design of control system 1: PID controller is investigated.\n(9)Design of control system 2: Compensation methods e.g. PD, PI, and PI-D are investigated.\n(10)Design of control system 3: Some famous tuning methods for the closed control system are investigated.\n(11)Introducing feedforward: In order to progress the responsibility, feedforward controller is introduced. We learn the design method of its controller.\n(12)Two degrees-of-freedom control system: 2 d.o.f. control system has the feature that the command and disturbance responses can be independently designed. We learn this feature.\n(13)Two degrees-of-freedom control system: We learn structures about some 2 d.o.f. control systems.\n(14)For final examination, We carry out exercises for final examination.\n\nFinal examination during the test period\n","prerequisites":"Differential equation, Laplace transformation, Analysis of electrical circuit, Mechanical dynamics","texts_and_materials":"Wakui, Hashimoto, Takanashi, Nakamura: Fundamentals of Control Engineering Available to Industry(Corona Ltd.)","assessment":"Based on the midterm examination and the semester examination.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Control, Laplace Transformation, Transfer Function, Frequency Response, Time Response","office_hours":"Any","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"2/27/2019 9:22:56 AM","name":{"id":824,"ja":"制御工学","en":"Control Engineering"},"instructor":{"id":724,"ja":"涌井 伸二","en":"WAKUI Shinji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"","office":"","day_period":"木3","references":""}}
