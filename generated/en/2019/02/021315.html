Students learn basic experimental methods and attitude (safety management, report preparation method, etc.) that will be needed in the future.\n\nThese experiments consist of two parts, \"Experiments of Basic Chemistry\" and \"Experiments of Physics\".\nLocation:\n\"Experiments of Basic Chemistry\":Building 1, 3F, Rooms 301-306\n\"Experiments of Physics\": Building 4, 2F, Rooms 201 and 204\n\n[Experiments of Basic Chemistry]\nThe students will learn fundamental skills and knowledge about inorganic analytical chemistry through the experiments.\n\n[Experiments of Physics]\nFrom these experiments, you will learn basal knowledge of physical chemistry and experimental technique about material science.\n\nYou will be ready to conduct your graduation research as expert experimentalists through the exercise lesson.\n","expected_learning":"Students who successfully complete this course will be able to :\n・Make experimental preparation.\n・Handle experimental tools properly.\n・Evaluate experimental results.\n・Treat experimental data in a competent way.\n・Write reports precisely and properly.\n\n[Experiments of Basic Chemistry]\nYou will learn preparation and arrangement for experiments/writing an experimental log/ data acquisition/discussing the results/writing an experimental report/calibration of glassware/significant figure and experimental error.\n[Experiments of Physics]\nEspecially, you will learn about making of experimental reports which are emphasized an analysis of experimental results and comprehensive discussion. We will equip you with method of calculation of experimental error and quotation of references in experimental reports.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"General Guaidance: Orientation, safety training, and writing experimental reports including physical quantity, SI units, and significant figure.\n\n[Experiments of Basic Chemistry]\nOrientation and safty training spesific to chemical experiments.\n1. How to use the basic experimental equipments for analytical chemistry: Volumetric flask、Pipette、burette、and balance.　　　　　\n2. Measurement of solution concentration: Preparation of solutions with known concentrations using volumetric flask.\n3. Calibration of one-mark pipette: Understanding an importance of systematic error on measurement experiments.\n4. Measurement of solution density: Preparation of aqueous solutions of NaCl with various concentrations. Calculation of density of each solutions. Determination of concentration of unknown sample based on calibration curve (density vs concentration).\n5. Glasswork: Making bottom of test tube, capillary for melting point measurement, etc.\n\n[Experiments of Physics]\nOrientation and safe training + seminar about experiments + experiments as follows;\n1. Simple harmonic oscillation (Examining spring constant and elastic strain energy of spring from an observation of simple harmonic oscillation of spring)\n2. Coupling pendulum (You will learn a theory of coupled vibration from connected two simple pendulum)\n3. Resonance of air core (You will examine about a wave motion from measurement of their frequency)\n4. Direct current (DC) circuit measurement (You will learn basal technique about measurement of voltage, current, and resistance)\n5. Alternating current (AC) circuit measurement (You will learn phase and complex notation on AC circuit)\n","prerequisites":"Students are required to prepare for each experiment from the safty point of veiw. They should carefully read the textbook to understand the content of the experiments (5 h).\nAfter the experiment is completed, the students should make an experiment report, which should be submited within the specified due date (15 h).\nIn addition to 25 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to perform the above task using the textbook and the references specified below.\nIn completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\n\nStudents entering this class should carry the students disaster and accident insurance for student education and research.\nStudents may not work in the lab without complete compliance with the safety policy, which will be announced at the course guidance (1st day) in detail.\n","texts_and_materials":"Original textbooks made by department\n","assessment":"Your grade will be determined largely by a total score of report points (50%) and degree of participation in class (50%). Your attitude in the laboratory will also be considered. You are expected to attend the course guidance and all lectures and laboratory sessions to pass the course.\nIf you have unexcused absences, arriving in class late, and late and/or missing reports, you may not receive a passing grade.\n","message_from_instructor":"You should take serious effort in this class and attempt to interpret the chemical phenomenon based on the principle so that you can reach a professional level as an individual chemist.\n\n[Experiments of Basic Chemistry]\nWear safety goggles in the chemical laboratory.\n[Experiments of Physics]\nTake part in experiments with positive attitude individually despite of group training","course_keywords":"Volumetric Analysis; Titration/ Colorimetric analysis; Oscillation/Vibration; Electrical Circuits; Basic Experiment; Inorganic Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Physical Chemistry","office_hours":"A/N Contact information will be shown in handout distributed at the course guidance.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/2/2019 8:47:35 AM","name":{"id":2089,"ja":"科学基礎実験","en":"Experiments in Fundamental Science"},"instructor":{"id":1526,"ja":"坪内 彰, 兼橋 真二","en":"TSUBOUCHI Akira, KANEHASHI Shinji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"","day_period":"木1～2","references":"Reference books useful for understanding the experiments scheduled in this course and analyzing the data obtained can be available in our University Library.\nJikkenn wo anzen ni okonautameni and Zoku Jikkenn wo anzen ni okonautameni (Manuarl for Safe Experiments in English), ed.
