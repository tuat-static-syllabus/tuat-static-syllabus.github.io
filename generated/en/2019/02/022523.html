We will use a method to stress a physical interpretation of mathematical formula, discussing the characteristic of the differential equations to describe physical phenomena. Especially, we will emphasize the characteristic of partial differential equations.\n\nResume:\nAs to the second order, linear differential equations, choosing wave and heat conduction equations as examples, which are basics in physics, analytical solving methods and numerical solving ones will be learned. Especially, classification of standard forms by the change of variables, separation method of variables as a powerful analytical solving method, and approach to the in-homogeneous equation will be acquired.\n","expected_learning":"Physical mathematics is a base of the special field of study at the Faculty of Engineering.
