It is divided into catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism is the set of metabolic pathways that breaks down molecules into smaller units that are either oxidized to release energy or used in other anabolic reactions. Anabolism is the set of metabolic pathways that construct molecules from smaller units. In this lecture, you will manly study anabolism.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1 Apr 9 Introduction\n2 Apr 16 The Calvin Cycle\n3 Apr 23 The Pentose Phosphate Pathway\n4 May 7 Recent advances in life science 1\n5 May 14 Glycogen Metabolism\n6 May 21 Fatty Acid Metabolism\n7 May 28 Protein Turnover 1\n8 June 4 Protein Turnover 2\n9 June 11 Amino Acid Catabolism\n10 June 18 Biosynthesis of Amino Acids\n11 June 25 Recent advances in life science 2\n12 July 2 Recent advances in life science 3\n13 July 9 Biosynthesis of nucleotides\n14 July 16 Biosynthesis of Membrane Lipids and Steroids\n15 July 23 Summary","prerequisites":"\"Basic physics\", \"Basic chemistry\", \"Basic biology\" and \"Biochemistry I\" are prerequisites.","texts_and_materials":"Biochemistry (Stryker)","assessment":"End of term exam: 60%.
