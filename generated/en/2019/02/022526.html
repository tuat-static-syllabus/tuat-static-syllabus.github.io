Materials behavior and performance must be properly understood and controlled by some constitutive laws with reference to practical service conditions. Fundamental mechanisms controlling the mechanical properties will be highlighted by materials characterization concerning the microstructure and lattice defects. Final objective of this course will be the understanding of the atomic mechanisms in microstructural evolution during heat treatments of steels.","expected_learning":"This subject is based on lectures in the classroom.It is allocated to viewpoint (B) in the diploma policy. Basic understanding of materials science and engineering is expected.\n1) capability of expaining the general properties of metallic materials like metallic bond and free electrons, crystal structure, dislocations and plasticity, eletric conductivity, thermal conductivity, color and reflection od visible light\n2) capability of characterizing the microstructure of metallic materials including crystal structure, phase constitution, grain size and grain morophology, and textures.\n3) capability of explaining plasticity and strengthening mechanisms with dislocation models\n4) capability of explaining diffusion mechanism and its related phenomena like recovery, recrystallization, precipitation, and sintering\n5) capability of explaining testing methods of materials strengths like hardness, tensile/compressive, shock loading, creep, fatigue tests\n6) capability of explaining microsrtuctural constitution with adequate reference to phase diagrams, phase rules, lever rule that are governed by thermodinamic aspect of phases\n7) capability of displaying typical phase diagrams of binary alloys with reference to invariant system reactions like eutectic/eutectoid and peritectic/peritectoid reactions\n8) capability of typifying practical engineering alloys such as bronze, brass, aluminum alloys, titanium alloys, and steels with relevance to their industrial standards\n9) capability of explaining the process of thermal treatment in carbon steels with reference to phase stability of ferrite/austenite phases and martensitic transformation\n\n","course_schedule":"Topical themes of each class will be as follows;\n(1) stiffness, yield strength and toughness of structural materials\n(2) from materials property to practical performance\n(3) new functional materials and materials innovation\n(4) basic concepts of Ashby's materials property charts and materials optimization\n(5) chemical bonds between/among atoms and molecules\n(6) pairwise potentials and ideal strength\n(7) crystallographic structure of metals and alloys\n(8) distorted structure around lattice defects and defect behavior\n(9) mechanisms and kinetics of atomic diffusion,recovery, recrystallization, and precipitation\n(10) thermodynamics in phase constitution, equilibrium phase diagrams, and invariant system reactions\n(11) phase rule and lever rule\n(12) microstructural evolution during heat treatments\n(13) annealing, normalizing, quenching, and tempering of carbon steels\n(14) engineering alloys and industrial standards\n(15) overview of metals and alloys Term examination by writing is compulsory.\n","prerequisites":"Aside from 30 hours for lectures in the classroom, additional 60 hours of self-study is necessary for preparation/review, written report submission, problem solving, and subject researches.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Grades will be evaluated totally and solely based upon the score of the final examination.
