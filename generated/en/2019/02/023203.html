Aim: Many useful bioactive and functional organic compounds are known. In order to understand the role of these compounds and synthesize complex organic molecules, we need to study the reactivity of organic molecules. The aim of this course is to summarize organic reactions which have learned from the four successive lectures (organic chemistry I to III, and bio organic chemistry) and such integrated knowledge will allow students to understand the perspective of reaction mechanism, and learn the application of organic reactions to organic synthesis.\n\nb. Outline: A variety of organic reactions are classified in to several reaction patterns. In this lecture, first how to understand organic reactions is expounded. Next the classification of organic reactions by their patterns and their application to organic synthesis are discussed.","expected_learning":"This lecture will allow students to understand the characteristic features of a variety of organic reactions employed for organic synthesis.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.-2. Retrosynthesis: Concept of retrosynthesis, which is useful for multi-step synthesis, is explained.\nMoreover, a variety of basic concepts in organic chemistry is learned.\n2.-3. Introduction of substituents to aromatic nuclei by electrophilic aromatic substitution: Reactivity and\norientation of substituted benzenes, order of functional group transformation.\n4.-5. Preparation and alkylation of carbanions: Classification of carbanions and their preparation, alkylation of\norganocopper reagents, acetylides, and active methylen compounds are discussed.\n5.-6. Aldol-type reactions and acylation: Application of aldol-type reactions, such as the Claisen-Schmidt\nreaction and Perkin condensation, and acylation such as the Claisen condensation are explained.\n7.-9. 1,4-Addition of carbanions: The Michael reaction, 1,4-addition of organocopper reagents and enamines\nare expounded. Application of these reactions to the Robinson annulations is also discussed.\n8. Summary of the first half. Midterm examination\n9.-10 . Construction of carbocycles: Irreversible reactions for the preparation of three- and four-membered rings\nand reversible reactions for the preparation of five- and six-membered rings are explained.\n10.-12. Analysis of total synthetic schemes: Analysis of total synthetic schemes will lead to study how a variety of\norganic synthetic methods are applied.\n12.-13. Pericyclic reactions: Pericyclic reactions, concerted reactions, electrocyclic reactions, cycloaddition\nreactions, and sigmatropic reactions are explained on the basis of frontier orbital theory.\n14.
