In this course we introduce the notion of an abstract vector space as a generalization of the space of plane or space vectors, as well as a linear map between two vector spaces, which is studied with its matrix representation. In particular, we will learn about basic properties and computation of a basis and the dimension of a vector space, the image and kernel of a linear map. We also learn about the concepts and methods of eigenvalues and eigenspaces, diagonalization, and metric spaces, aiming at better understanding of linear algebra.\n","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is:\n1) to understand basic notions of vector spaces, linear maps, linear independence and bases\n2) capable to calculate (bases of) the image and kernel of a linear map given by a matrix\n3) capable to calculate the representation matrix of a linear map with respect to given bases\n4) capable to calculate the eigen values and eigen spaces of a square matrix and determine whether it is diagonalizable\n5) capable to ortho-normalize a given basis of a metric space\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.
