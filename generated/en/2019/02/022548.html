Then in order to understand the real motion of object, it is required to develop the equation of motion and solve it. In this course, the treatment will be lectured for typical cases.\nIn addition to that, the concepts of \"work\" and \"energy\" are introduced to obtain deeper understanding on motion, from the different point of view rather than the equation of motion. Furthermore, the concept of \"angular momentum\" is introduced to understand the motion of rotation.\nThe mathematical treatments will be lectured to understand and apply these concepts, if needed.","expected_learning":"Mechanics is the base knowledge for the field related to physic, then it is very helpful to understand the topics in the field of mechanical systems engineering especially.\nThe goal of this course is to understand the concepts related to motion, work, and energy which are accompanied by resistance, vibration, and rotation, and to apply these knowledges to solve the given situation.\nNot only these knowledges and application ability, it is also expected to apply the technical terms to describe the given situation, to express the situation with proper mathematical formula, and to derive the final solution. It is expected for the participants to understand that these three are the standard topics to be included in engineering discussion.\n\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n* Refer to the curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"* following is just provided as an example; the number at each end represent the chapter in the textbook\n* the earlier half is relatively slow to encourage the correct understanding, and the latter half will be gradually speeded-up based on the knowledges already obtained.\n\nweek-1 : guidance of this course, dimension, and significant figures with precision and error (chap-0)\nweek-2 : relation between position, velocity, and acceleration in cartesian coordinate, also in constant-velocity rotation motion to be led to expressions in polar coordinate system (chap-1)\nweek-3 : application of the equation of motion, case study of constant-velocity rotation motion, and introduction of momentum (chap-2)\nweek-4 : case study of motion under resistance proportional to velocity (chap-3-1)\nweek-5 : case study of motion under resistance proportional to velocity in gravity field (chap-3-2 and 3-3)\nweek-6 : oscillation, especially simple harmonic (chap-4-1)\nweek-7 : oscillation with dumping (chap-4-2)\nweek-8 : progress confirmation test for the topics in the earlier half (chap-0 to chap 3)\nweek-9 : oscillation with external cyclic force (chap-4-3)\nweek-10 : work and energy (chap 5)\nweek-11 : momentum of rotation and angular momentum (chap-6-1 and 6-2)\nweek-12 : equation of rotation and central force (chap-6-3 and 6-4)\nweek-13 : spherical shell theory and universal gravitation (chap-7-1)\nweek-14 : potential and motion of stars (chap-7-2)\nweek-15 : final test for the topic of latter half mainly","prerequisites":"Certification of physics in high school level.\nBasic knowledge on the calculation of vectors, derivation and integration\n\nIn addition to 30hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the text specified below.","texts_and_materials":"(in Japanese, available at COOP book store in Koganei-campus)\n\"Rikoukei no tame no Toku!
