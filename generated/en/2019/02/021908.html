Computations in linear algebra are based on matrices and their elementary transformations, which enable us to treat more abstract notions such as linear maps and linear independence at hand. In this course we will learn about various computations with matrices (elementary transformation, determinants etc.), via which the concept of \"linearity\" behind them will be understood.\n","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is:\n1) capable to perform basic operations on matrices\n2) capable to calculate the reduced row echelon form of a matrix with elementary transformation\n3) capable to calculate the determinant of a square matrix\n4) capable to apply the above techniques to solving a system of linear equations, computations of inverse matrices and linear (in)dependence of column vectors\n5) to understand the correspondence between the Euclidean vector space and the space of column vectors, as well as the basic notions for those vectors\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps","course_schedule":"1. Matrices and their operations\n2. Square matrices: inverse matrices, regular matrices etc.\n3. Block division of matrices\n4. Elementary transformation and row echelon form\n5. Applications: system of linear equations and inverse matrices\n6. Determinants 1: permutations\n7. Summary: Exercises and/or midterm examination\n8. Determinants 2: a definition and basic properties\n9. Determinants 3: cofactor expansion\n10. Determinants 4: adjoints and Cramer's formula\n11. The vector space of column vectors with real entries\n12. Linear combination and linear independence of column vectors\n13. 3-dimensional space vectors\n14. Exercises summarizing the semester\n15.
