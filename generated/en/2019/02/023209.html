Methods of precise measurements and detailed analyses of experimental data should be performed. In addition, visitings may help acquire a complex set of abilities for becoming a creative and independent researcher.","expected_learning":"Cultivate and/or improve abilities to interpret various phenomena theoretically through careful observations and precise measurements of accompanied changes in physical quantities, followed by detailed analyses of available data.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n\n","course_schedule":"1W: Guidance\n2W-6W: Experiments (1)-(5) are in turn studied.\n(1)Kinetics of hydrolysis\n(2)Conductivity of solutions\n(3)Electromotive force of a chemical cell\n(4)Victor-Meyer Method (Molecular Weight Determination)\n(5)Surface tension of solution\n7W-9W: Lectures (1)-(3) are sheduled in this order.\n(1)X-ray diffraction\n(2)Equilibrium constant[Computing calculation]\n(3)English reading\n10W: Achievement test\n\n[Notes]\n*Visitation: One visitation is carried out.\n*Achievement test: Making questions from Experiments (1)-(5).","prerequisites":"Students are required to prepare for each experiment from the safty point of veiw. They should carefully read the textbook to understand the content of the experiments (5 h).\nAfter the experiment is completed, the students should make an experiment report, which should be submited within the specified due date (15 h).\nIn addition to 25 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to perform the above task using the textbook and the references specified below.\nIn completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\n\nStudents entering this class should carry the students disaster and accident insurance for student education and research.\nStudents may not work in the lab without complete compliance with the safety policy, which will be announced at the course guidance (1st day) in detail.","texts_and_materials":"Textbook ed. by our Department and documents given at the guidance.","assessment":"Your grade will be determined largely by a total score of report points (containig quiz score) (50%) and degree of participation in class (50%).
