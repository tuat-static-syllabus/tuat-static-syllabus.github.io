Therefore, it is a required subject for students learning the fundamental information theory and its applications.\n\nIn this lecture, the mathematical definition of information, source coding theorem, communication channels, and channel coding theorem are reviewed mainly with the original prints and textbooks. Also, the basic knowledge in this field also will be introduced.","expected_learning":"Learners who complete this course will be able to understand:\n- the notion of entropy and information,\n- the fundamental limits of data compression,\n- the theoretical limits of error correction.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps (computer and information science, diploma policy type B).","course_schedule":"1. Introduction & binary code\n2. Probability theory (sets, permutation, random variable, Bayes' theorem)\n3. Probability distribution (random variable, probability distribution, central limit theorem)\n4. Probability process (Markov process, stationary distribution)\n5. Definition of information (self-information, entropy, Shannon’s fundamental inequality)\n6. Source and channel models\n7. Examination 1\n8. Mutual information\n9. Ttransinformation and channel capacity\n10. Basis of source coding (encoding and decoding)\n11. Basis of channel coding (error detecting and correction, Shannon's first fundamental theorem)\n12. Expanded source coding (block Huffman coding)\n13. Parity check (Hamming code, Shannon's 2nd fundamental theorem)\n14. Coding theory (linear code, cyclic code)\n15. Examination 2","prerequisites":"This lecture is part of the courses in the department of computer and information science.
