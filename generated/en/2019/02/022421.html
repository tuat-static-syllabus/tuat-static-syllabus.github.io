You need to add your own discussions on the experimental data using the basic principles in each field. In your report, background of the experimental theme, objective, experimental procedures, results, discussions and conclusions are summarized in a logical manner.\n\nYou are expected to conduct five themes, such as synthesis of organic molecules, measurement of a property of organic molecules, enzyme reaction and genes. Well-organized report should be submitted. You will have an interview on your report.\n概要：有機分子の合成、有機分子の物性測定、酵素反応、遺伝子のそれぞれに関係する実験を行う。得られた実験結果に対して、実験テキスト記載の課題に沿った考察を行う。各実験テーマ毎に背景(理論)、目的、実験方法、結果、考察、結論及び参考文献を論理的にまとめたレポートを作成し提出する。レポート記載内容に対する口頭試問も行う。","expected_learning":"Students need to aquire fumdamental experimental techniques. A reasonable discussion on your own data should be added. You also need to gain methods of writing of scientific report. In the interview, you need to gain a capability to have a discussion in the interview.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"You need to have a 10-min exam. at the begginign of every lecture. Five different topics, synthesis of organic molecules (2), specific rotation, enzyme reaction and genes are provided. You need to make a report for each theme. You also need to have an interview for each report.\nStudents are devided into small groups and each group conducts one experiment.
