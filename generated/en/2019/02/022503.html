The basic unit of organic compounds are assembled functionable macromolecule, and recycle system reassmbles as required. The enzyme as protein compound is “micro macine” expressed by transcription and translation in the flow of genetic information. The cell factory holds constency between energy consumption and biosynthesis with cytoplasmic apparatus.\nIn this basic biology course, we learn fundamentals of biological aspects of life.\nThe lecturer of this course has the firsthand experiences on biology in various corporates, and will describe actual examples from industry for case-studies, analyses and discussion.","expected_learning":"To make abstract of each theme on 1 to 2 pages of A4 sized paper","course_schedule":"(1)Origin of life\n\n(2)Tree of life\n\n(3)The chemistry of life\n\n(4)Large biological molecules\n\n(5)The cell\n\n(6)Fundamentals of metabolic energy flow\n\n(7)Chemical energy production\n\n(8)Photosynthesis\n\n(9)Meiosis and sexual life cycle\n\n(10)Genetics\n\n(11)Chromosomal basics\n\n(12)DNA and reprication\n\n(13)Gene expression\n\n(14)Regulation of gene expression\n\n(15)Viruses","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"CAMPBELL BIOLOGY 9th edition, PEARSON","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"I will lecture to the student who mentions biology for the first time","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"6/4/2019 7:21:36 PM","name":{"id":1813,"ja":"生物学基礎","en":"Biology Basics"},"instructor":{"id":1135,"ja":"杉立 年弘","en":"SUGITATE Toshihiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"2nd","course_type":"2nd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
