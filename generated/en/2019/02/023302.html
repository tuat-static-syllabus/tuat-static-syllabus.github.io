In particular, the many body system, which cannot be dealt with in classical mechanics, can be explained by probability theory.\nThe usage of micro-canonical, canonical, and grand-canonical ensembles is studied through a lot of examples. A mini exam will be performed at the start of the lecture for confirming the understanding.","expected_learning":"Various problems such as gas kinetics, spin motion, polymer conformation, and surface adsoption can be explained by the methods provided in the lecture.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"I.
