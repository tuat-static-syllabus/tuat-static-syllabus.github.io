Furthermore, its machining or assembly can be planned and evaluated on the basis of 3D model. Therefore, it is indispensable to use 3D CAD (Computer Aided Design) through design and production of modern mechanical systems. In this exercises, the goal is to acquire the operation method of 3D model. In the first half, students generate and assemble 3D model of parts of Stirling engine and realize the motion simulation on computer. In the latter half, students address free drawing of mechanical system and present it at the last week.\nThis course is a compulsory subject in the curriculum of MSE department.","expected_learning":"(1) Modeling and assembly of 3D mechanical parts, and motion simulation of mechanical system\n(2) Understanding of representation method and data structure of 3D CAD, and modification of given 3D model\n(3) 3D model generation and drawing from 2D drawing\n(4) Acquisition of basic operation method of 3D CAD, usage of on-line help for unclear operation by oneself\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1. Guidance, Installation of Solidworks, and on-line tutorials\n#Bring your own notebook PC\n2-8 Build a 3D model of a Stirling engine\n2. Modeling 1: Basic introduction of CAD model (Surface, Sketch, Feature)\n3. Modeling 2: Rule and etiquette of modeling\n4. Modeling 3: Various modeling techniques\n5. Modeling 4: Modeling from 2-D drawing\n6. Assembly 1: Assembly with standard parts, mate and restriction\n7. Assembly 2:\n8. Drawing and simulation\n9. Review\nMid-term exam\n10-14 CAD project (Choose from individual/group production, Museum project)\n10. CAD project 1: Grouping, theme decision, discussion\n11. CAD project 2: Production, Clarification of challenging issues\n12. CAD project 3: Production, Breakthrough\n13. CAD project 4: Production, brush-up\n14. CAD project 5: Production, preparation of presentation\n15. Presentation\nA final exam\n\n","prerequisites":"It is expected that students have already acquired a fundamental knowledge of “Mechanical drawing” and ”Mechanical systems”.\n\nAs a CAD project, you should be asked to make a specific CAD model or assembly. Please discuss and decide your responsibility in your group. Approximately, 15-hours off-campus study will be required together with 45-hours class.\n","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Drill : 30%, ，Midterm exam : 30%, Free drawing : 40%","message_from_instructor":"It is desirable to practice software such as 3D CAD by oneself.
