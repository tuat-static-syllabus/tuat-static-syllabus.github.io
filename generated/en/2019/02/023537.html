Attitude expression and rotational motion, classification of stabilization method, control method based on classical control and modern control theories will be lectured. The stability condition, spin speed control and spin axis control of passive spin-stabilized satellites will be explained, focusing on the relationship with attitude representation. Classification of triaxial satellites, their rotational motion characteristics, and attitude control are lectured for each classification.","expected_learning":"It is required to understand the attitude representation, control methods, attitude control devices, disturbance torque acting on the artificial satellite, and the operation principle of attitude sensors. It is required to learn and understand equations of rotational motion of the artificial satellite and the control methodology for designing the artificial satellite attitude control.\nPass criterion for this lecture is to exceed 60 points with respect to the total points of the report evaluation score and the final exam score.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.
