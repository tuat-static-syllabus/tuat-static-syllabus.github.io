This theory is an important tool to study geometry of curves and surfaces and to analyze various phenomena in dynamics, electromagnetism, fluid mechanics, etc. This course treats basic concepts in vector analysis so that students can use them as familiar tools to understand characteristics of scalar fields and vector fields.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n1. Understand basic calculus of vector-valued functions, and execute it correctly\n2. Understand the fundamental concept of curves, surfaces, and vector fields, and handle it with high calculation ability\n3. Understand line integrals and surface integrals, and apply fundamental theorems (especially, divergence theorem and Stokes' theorem) to their calculations.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Vector Algebra (Chapter 1.1,Chapter 1.2)\nWeek 2: Vector Algebra (Chapter 1.3)\nWeek 3: Differentiation and Integration of Vectors (Chapter 2)\nWeek 4: Scalar Fields, Vector field, Gradient (Chapter 3.1)\nWeek 5: Scalar Potential (Chapter 3.1)\nWeek 6: Divergence (Chapter 3.2)\nWeek 7: Rotation (Chapter 3.2)\nWeek 8: Differential Geometry of Space Curves (Chapter 3.3)\nWeek 9: Line Integrals (Chapter 3.4)\nWeek 10: Differential Geometry of Surfaces (Chapter 3.4)\nWeek 11: Surface Integrals (Chapter 3.4)\nWeek 12: Divergence Theorem (Chapter 4.1)\nWeek 13: Stokes' Theorem (Chapter 4.2)\nWeek 14: Aplications of The Integration formula (Chapter 4.3)\nWeek 15: Term Examination\n\nHomework: \"Problems\" and \"Exercises\" in the relevant part of the textbook","prerequisites":"Students entering this class are assumed to have learned Calculus I-II and Linear Algebra I-II.","texts_and_materials":"YANO Kentaro, et al., Bekutoru Kaiseki (Vector Analysis), Shokabo","assessment":"Exercise 20%, Term examination 80%","message_from_instructor":"It is required that you clarify your questionable points by reading the textbook before attending each lecture.
