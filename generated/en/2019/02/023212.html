Also, it connects with the all the areas of engineering. In this lecture, we aim to understand the solid-state science, which is affected by the structural changes such as atomic state, molecular state and crystal structure, and by the changes of electronic states.\nFurthermore, in the latter part of lecture, we will study about the semicomductor physics/chemistry for understanding the new function of material by the introduction of quantum effects and so on.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"#1 Introduction\n#2 Classification of materials\n#3 Structure of ideal solid 1\n#4 Structure of ideal solid 2\n#5 Structure of imperfect solid\n#6 Electronic state of solid 1\n#7 Electronic state of solid 2\n#8 Exercise 1\n#9 Semiconductor and insulator\n#10 Type of semiconductors\n#11 Compound semiconductors and its electronic structure\n#12 Superlattice structure and its electronic structure\n#13 Crystal growth 1\n#14 Crystal growth 2\n#15 Exercise 2\n","prerequisites":"Nothing","texts_and_materials":"Nothing","assessment":"Attitude for the learning, midterm exam, final exam, and reports","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Electronic property, material, semiconductor, crystal, superlattice, quantum effect","office_hours":"10:00-15:00 on Monday","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/1/2019 11:25:30 AM","name":{"id":743,"ja":"半導体化学","en":"Semi-conductive Materials Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":691,"ja":"村上 尚","en":"MURAKAMI Hisashi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"","day_period":"金2","references":"Semiconductor engineering (Edited by Kazumasa Hiramatsu, Ohmsha written in Japanese)"}}
