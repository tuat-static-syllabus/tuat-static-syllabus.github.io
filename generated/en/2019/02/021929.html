In this course, we will learn about differentiation and integration of multivariable functions, such as partial differentiations, criteria of local maxima and minima, double and triple integrations, volumes of solids, line integrations and series. Various computations will be practiced with drawing diagrams","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiation and integration of two, or multivariable functions, and\n(2) to be capable of performing practical computations.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps","course_schedule":"1. Limits and continuity of functions of two variables\n2. Partial differentiations and total differentiations\n3. Higher order partial differentiations, and partial differentiations of composite functions\n4. Taylor’s theorem for functions of two variables\n5. Local maxima and minima of functions of two variables\n6. Exercises, or midterm examination\n7. Double integrations\n8. Changes of variables\n9. Triple integrations, and changes of variables by using the system of polar coordinates\n10. Improper integrations\n11. Volumes of solids and areas of surfaces\n12. Line integrations and Green's theorem\n13. Series and power series 1\n14. Series and power series 2\n15. Exercise and final examination\nA common examination will be conducted extra at the last of the term in the adjustment period for all the classes of this course.","prerequisites":"Knowledge of the course of Calculus I and Exercise will be used in the lecture.\nIn addition to 60 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for\nand revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and\nusing the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below","texts_and_materials":"will be introduced at the first lecture.","assessment":"Evaluation will be done according to the Klausuren(Midterm examination 50%.
