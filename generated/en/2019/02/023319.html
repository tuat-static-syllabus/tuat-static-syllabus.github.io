What determines the body function is dynamic and plastic soft material inside and outside the cell, that is, a string-like macromolecular protein and its associated body. If you manage your body's soft material appropriately with your own efforts, you will live healthier in the first century and can keep chasing your dreams.","expected_learning":"1) What is the difference between life chemistry and artifacts as the nucleus of organic chemistry that started from the study of the material aspects of living things? 2) What is the essence of soft material that produces its own boldness on a daily basis? 3) Elements What are the characteristics of soft materials that lead to reductive life chemistry to total life science? 4) What is the substance / cause of deterioration of soft material accompanying time progression of organisms? 5) Anti - aging characteristics and relationship between body motion and soft material. 6) Do you know the difference in design principle between people and nonhuman beings (plants, animals / birds, microorganisms etc.) and artifacts? 7) Can you explain the life science base for life sustainability and human sustainability as a member of a sustainable society?","course_schedule":"(1st) Introduction to Soft Materials\n(Part 2) Bio and Soft Materials\n(3rd) Soft Material in Cell\n(4th) Artificial Soft Materials ・ Plastics and Humanity\n(5 th) Biomaterials made by soft materials\n(6 th) Soft Materials' Body, Movement, 'Output Dependence'\n(7 th) Eggshell membrane making as an example of soft material and industrial examples of the future society and aging society\n(Eighth) Eggshell membrane material as an example of soft material.

What does that mean?\n(2) About human being (self): Please write about the human and society that continues to change about the fun and dangers, creativity and imagination of the human system brain science.\n(3) Please write about the points of contact with other classes of the Department of Chemistry of Organic Materials.","message_from_instructor":"Please understand self-creation, changeable life principle, learn respect for individual, new social industry creation, self-innovation way of life.","course_keywords":"Life science, life, cell-to-body & mind dynamics, exercise and nutrition, activity dependence, central dogma, biological properties","office_hours":"Thursday 16: 30-18: 00 ※ If you take an appointment by e-mail, you can make reservations at other dates and times. mshmz@cc.tuat.ac.jp, yatomi@cc.tuat.ac.jp","remarks_1":"I will give you feedback as much as possible to the lesson report.","remarks_2":"Provide practical training to understand cellular systems and human (yourself) system (possibility of location change).
