Good understanding of physical chemistry enables students to predict and theorize chemical reactions. The purpose of this course is to deepen understandings of physical chemistry through the exercises in the textbook of Atkins Physical Chemistry. Students are strongly recommended to take the physical chemistry I and II. Each lecture consists of explanations of examples (20 min), mini examination (50 min), and the commentaries (20 min). This course is taught by two lecturers. This course is mandatory for every student in the department of applied chemistry.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to understand fundamentals of gases, laws of thermodynamics, pure substances and solutions, and chemical equilibria.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"The contents of the course are summarized as follows,\n1. The properties of gases (perfect gas, kinetic theory)\n2. The properties of gaees (real gas)\n3. The first law of thermodynamics (Internal energy, Enthalpy)\n4. The first law of thermodynamics (thermochemistry, Joule-Thomson effect, Adiabatic change)\n5. The second and third law of thermodynamics (Entropy, Gibbs energy)\n6. Physical transformations of pure substances (Phase diagram of pure substances, phase transition)\n7. Simple mixtures (themodynamics of mixtures, Solution)\n8. Simple mistures (diagram of mistures, Activity)\n9. Equilibrium electrochemistry (Chemical equilibrm, Electrochemical cell)\n10. Equilibrium electrochemistry (Cell potential, Electromotive force, Standard potential)\n\nExamination\n1. Properties of gas ~ The third law of thermodynamics\n2. Physical transformations of pure substances ~ Equilibrium electrochemistry\n\n・The first class includes introduction of this class.\n・The use of calculator is permitted during the course.\n・Students are allowed to use textbooks and notebooks only for mini examinations.\n・Mobile phone and smart phone must be turn off during the course.\n","prerequisites":"In completing this course, students will spend at least the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\nStudents are recommended to attend the classes Physical Chemistry I and Physical Chemistry II.","texts_and_materials":"Atkins physical chemistry the 10th edition\nPeter Akins/Julio de Paula, Translated by M.
