The process of obtaining the desired product from the reactants in a chemical plant involves the movement of fluid, heat and mass. In order to control the plant normally and determine the operating conditions for it, it is necessary to understand the velocity distribution, temperature distribution, and material concentration distribution of the fluid in the plant. To obtain these distributions, we usually balance the momentum of the fluid, heat and matter. These balance equations are usually differential equations. And from the solution of that differential equation you can get their distribution in the plant. In addition, the form of these differential equations is determined to some extent, and each differential equation has its own solution. In this lecture, you will learn a series of methodologies for establishing balance equations for phenomena related to various chemical processes, obtaining differential equations from them, and obtaining their solutions.","expected_learning":"(1) A balance formula can be created.\n(2) A typical ordinary differential equation (obtained from the balance equation) can be solved analytically.\n(3) A typical partial differential equation (obtained from the balance equation) can be solved analytically.\n(4) A typical differential equation can be analytically solved using the Laplace transform.\n(5) Understand the concept of numerical calculation.\n(6) A typical partial differential equation (obtained from the balance equation) can be solved numerically.","course_schedule":"1, Introduction of mathematics for chemical process.\n2, 1st order Ordinary differential equation 1\n3, 1st order Ordinary differential equation 2\n4, 2nd order Ordinary differential equation 1\n5, 2nd order Ordinary differential equation 2\n6, 2nd order Ordinary differential equation 3\n7, 2nd order Ordinary differential equation 4\n8, Laplace transform 1\n9, Laplace transform 2\n10, Partial differential equation 1\n11, Partial differential equation 2\n12, Fundamental of numerical simulation for partial differential equation\n13, Numerical simulation for partial differential equation 1\n14, Numerical simulation for partial differential equation 2\n15, Exam\n","prerequisites":"n/a","texts_and_materials":"Distribute teaching materials as needed.","assessment":"More than 60 points are passed(final exam=60 points ,assignments or exercises=40 points, total=100 points)\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Make an appointment by email.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/10/2020 4:15:26 PM","name":{"id":768,"ja":"化学プロセス数学","en":"Mathematics of Chemical Processes"},"instructor":{"id":698,"ja":"長津 雄一郎","en":"NAGATSU Yuichiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Thu.4","references":"数学で学ぶ化学工学11話、斉藤　著、朝倉書店\n化学工学のための数学―移動現象解析を中心に、小川、黒田、吉川　共著、数理工学社\n数学でわかる身近な移動現象のはなし、相良　著、日刊工業新聞社\n化学工学のための数学の使い方、相良　著　化学工学会　編、丸善出版\nBird, Stewart, Lightfoot, Transport Phenomena 2nd Edition (2002), Wiley"}}
