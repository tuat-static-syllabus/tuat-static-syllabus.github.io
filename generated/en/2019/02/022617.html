In this lecture, we start with movement of a certain mass point, proceed to vibration of several mass points linked to each other, and finally learn wave like a string. In oscillation, we can see various unique characteristics of waves: beat of two oscillations, standing wave, interference, and diffraction. The most important concept to explain these phenomena is the principle of wave superposition. Therefore, we focus on 'coupled oscillator' and 'wave superposition principle' in this lecture.　This course is taught by Prof. Miho Yanagisawa.","expected_learning":"(1) Be able to think from the movement of one mass point to the vibrational movement of multiple mass points and then to waves such as continuous strings.\n(2)Be able to uniformly explain the unique properties of various waves such as beats, standing waves, interference and diffraction according to the principle of wave superposition.\n(3)Be able to understand how many phenomena can be explained with less basic thinking.\n\nSee the curriculum map.","course_schedule":"1.
