I mention a tip materials technology in consideration for environment while understanding the basics of materials science including steel and the semiconductor. I put the subject for materials properties and a use, materials manufacturing process, development and the design of materials and push forward a lecture while interlacing real application example and problems. I share the announcement to four groups and perform English general remarks, the subscription of the article, group announcement and question discussion. In addition to knowledge, I aim at communication and the ability improvement about the discussion method.","expected_learning":"(１) Understanding crystal structure, a lattice defect, diffusion, a mechanical property, reinforcement mechanism, a phase diagram, a histogenetic concept and can judge the profit utilization as structure materials and the functional material.\n(２) Understanding structure of a manufacturing method and the systems architecture of materials and explaining the relation to environment and a social problem.","course_schedule":"(1) Guidance: Environment, society, the materials\n(2) Materials properties: The crystal structure and lattice defect\n(3) Materials properties: The diffusion\n(4) Materials properties and a use: The mechanical property and reinforcement mechanism\n(5) Materials properties and a use: The phase equilibrium and phase diagram\n(6) Materials properties and a use: The histogeny\n(7) Materials properties and a use: The physical chemical property\n(8) Middle test\n(9) Materials manufacturing process: Global warming, the metal manufacturing process\n(10) Materials manufacturing process: Recycling society, the resources\n(11) Materials manufacturing process: The systems architecture, processing and heat-treatment, corrosion and prevention of rust\n(12) Development and the design of materials: The group announcement and discussion (one group, two groups)\n(13) Development and the design of materials: The group announcement and discussion (three groups, four groups)\n(14) Development and the design of materials: Group announcement supplement, the introduction of the hydrogen energy society\n(15) Semester report\n","prerequisites":"I put an important point for the structure (crystal structure, lattice defect, histogeny) of materials and the scientific understanding of properties of matter (thermodynamics, diffusion, dynamics properties of matter, solid properties of matter). Because yo also study on inorganic chemistry and physicochemical basic knowledge, please review it enough.","texts_and_materials":"handout","assessment":"The object of the evaluation is a middle test, group announcement, a semester test or a report mainly, but evaluates the achievement degree to be able to put a lecture. It is said that the answer to practice contents that I carried out by a lecture are targeted for an evaluation. I evaluate the results in S(90-), A(80-90), B(70-80), C(60-70), D( failure).","message_from_instructor":"The materials associate with environment and society closely, and it is important that I understand the basic science.
