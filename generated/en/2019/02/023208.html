Dr. Motegi is conducting research on chemical engineerings and catalysis at the University of Tokyo. The contents of the lecture may be changed by the lecturer.\n\nThe purpose\nChemical engineering is based on the quantitative treatment of “equilibrium” and “rate of change” and utilizing the results for phenomenon analysis, device design, operation design, control, etc. In this lecture, we will learn the laws and ideas about the foundation of \"equilibrium\" and \"rate of change\".\n\nOverview\nWhat is the state (equilibrium) in which a substance exists stably in nature, the speed at which the state of matter is about to change, and the driving force that causes it? learn. After learning the concept of equilibrium and the concept of velocity, we will learn how to express transfer rate and transfer rate, and how to use it, which involves three physical quantities: substance (component concentration), momentum (flow) and heat (energy).","expected_learning":"You will learn (understand) about the rules of \"Equilibrium\" and \"Change (rate)\".
