Dr. Iwasaki is also involved in assessments such as risk communication and river management with high metal concentration around abandoned mines, and I ask for lectures from the viewpoint of practitioners. Learn the concept and basis of human health risk assessment and ecological risk assessment of chemical substances, and introduce case studies and practice calculations. In addition to one-way \"lectures\", students will actively make opportunities for presentations by students and opportunities to think and discuss with their own heads. In addition, two or three outside speakers will be invited to provide related topics.","expected_learning":"1) Acquire how to evaluate various risks in daily life (tips on how to “survive” daily life)\n2) Understand the current states of environmental risk assessment and management of chemicals\n","course_schedule":"1. Introduction\n2. Introduction to environmental risk assessment\n3. How to do human health risk assessment\n4. Exercise for human health risk assessment: exposure assessment\n5. Exercise for human health risk assessment: risk calculation\n6. Human health risk assessment: other applications\n7. Ecological risk assessment: before going into the details\n8. Basics and procedures for ecological risk assessment\n9. How to determine “no effect”: a statistical analysis for ecological risk assessment\n10. How to develop the environmental water quality standard for zinc\n11. Zinc regulation and issues\n12. Discussion on zinc regulation\n13. Case studies for ecological risk management\n14. Case studies for ecological risk management\n15. Summary\n","prerequisites":"It is preferable to have a high-level (slightly) mathematical background, but we welcome those who are willing to actively participate in lectures and have the motivation to learn using their own head.","texts_and_materials":"No text in this class. The materials necessary for the lecture will be distributed each time. Also, the slides used for the lecture will be made available via Moodle after the lecture.","assessment":"Ordinal points and participation in lectures, submissions, and final exam","message_from_instructor":"By learning the risk assessment and management of chemical substances, I hope that you will learn trial and error methods to decipher everyday “risk”. Come and go to the world of dazzling risk assessment research.","course_keywords":"Environmental risk assessment, ecological risk assessment, water quality environmental standard, cancer risk","office_hours":"None for a part-time lecturer","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/21/2020 5:59:14 PM","name":{"id":612,"ja":"環境物質化学概論","en":"Environmental Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":595,"ja":"岩﨑 雄一","en":"IWASAKI Yuuichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Wed.4","references":"Keiko Nakanishi \"Environmental Risk Theory\" Iwanami Shoten (1995)\nKazuya Nakatani \"The Monopoly of Risk-Is There a Safe, Secure Life?\" Japan Broadcasting Corporation's Association (2006)"}}
