In this course, we will learn the differentiations and the integrations of various functions with one variable, and their properties. We will practice advanced computations in this course rather than in high schools.\n","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is\n\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiations and the integrations of various functions, such as polynomials, rational and irrational functions, trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic function,\n(2) to understand how to calculate the values at maxima and minima of functions, and\n(3) to be capable of performing practical computations on determining areas of figures and lengths of curves.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps","course_schedule":"1. Continuity of real numbers and series\n2. Limits of functions\n3. Continuity of functions, and inverse functions\n4. Differentiations of functions with one variable\n5. The mean-value theorem and l'Hopital's rule\n6. Parametric descriptions of curves, and differentiations in high order\n7. Review, midterm examination\n8. Taylor's theorem\n9. Definite integrations, and indefinite integrations\n10. Exercises on integrations I\n11. Exercises on integrations II\n12. Improper integrations\n13. Applications of definite integrations I\n14. Applications of definite integrations II\n15. Review, term examination\n\nA common examination will be conducted extra at the last of the term in the adjustment period for all the classes of this course.","prerequisites":"Mathematics in high schools will be used in the lecture.\nIn addition to 60 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Results of the midterm examination, the term examination, and the common examination at the last of the term will be used for evaluation.
