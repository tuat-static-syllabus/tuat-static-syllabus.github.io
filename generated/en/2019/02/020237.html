The goal of this course is to introduce basic physics and its applications for both physics and non-physics students. The main fields to be covered in the lectures are: wave phenomena, electromagnetics, optics and basic quantum physics.\nWe will approach the topics of physics using existing tangible examples that illustrate the relevance of physics to your lives such as commercial electronic devices and imaging instruments, and will learn how physics is used in their product designs. We will not spend so much time on studying how to solve complicated equations; instead, we will focus on learning some important simplified models and mathematical concepts for understanding a variety of physical phenomena. This course includes interactive group work sessions and opportunities for presentations in English.","expected_learning":"Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:\n- Identify the key physical phenomena found in electronic devices around you, and explain how they work.\n- Use simple equations, appropriate diagrams and graphs to describe wave phenomena.\n- Recognize the relations between physics and other disciplines (biology, chemistry, medicine etc.).\n- Gain communication and presentation skills in English, and more importantly, in your own words.\n\nCompetency Development: Knowledge on Science and Technology, Innovative Thinking, Communication Skills, Presentation Skills","course_schedule":"1. Understanding how electronic devices work (1): PCs and smartphones\n2. Understanding how electronic devices work (2): cameras\n3. Understanding how electronic devices work (3): displays\n4. Understanding how electronic devices work (4): wireless devices\n5. Understanding how electronic devices work (5): room lights and other light sources (LEDs and lasers)\n6. Modeling waves using mathematics\n7. Sound waves and electromagnetic waves\n8. Geometric optics: human eyes and vision\n9. Wave optics: laser technologies, optical fibers, diffraction and interference phenomena\n10. Imaging devices for biomedical sciences (ultrasound, optical microscope, X-ray)\n11. How to analyze waves: the concept of Fourier transform\n12. Introduction to quantum physics: wave-particle duality\n13. Light and matters: absorption, emission and fluorescence spectra\n14. Presentations: investigate and summarize on a specific topic of your interest\n15. Recap and final exam","prerequisites":"I recommend that you read the reference textbook prior to lecture, but you are NOT expected to memorize the details.\nIn addition to 30 hours you spend in the class, you are recommended to prepare for and revise the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University for each class.","texts_and_materials":"Lecture handouts and materials will be prepared for each class.","assessment":"The final grades for this course will be given based on:\n- Final exam score (70%)\n- Participation during the lectures: including working in groups, answering questions and quizzes (30%)\nNote that more than 70 % attendance is required to sit for the exam.","message_from_instructor":"Through this course, I hope you will become familiar with many exciting topics of physics that drive many innovative electronics products and real world industrial applications. This multi-disciplinary course offers group work activities with students from other universities. If you have already taken some physics classes, this course will be a great opportunity for you to check your understanding by trying to explain the physics in your own words. Of course, we also welcome students from other majors. I encourage you to ask any simple questions to me and other students during the class or in office hours. Your simple questions will stimulate the classroom and will make other students realize that what they thought they understood was actually what they didn't.\nI hope you will enjoy the interactions between the three universities!","course_keywords":"wave phenomena, electronics, electromagnetics, geometric and wave optics, basic quantum physics","office_hours":"Monday 10am - 11am.
