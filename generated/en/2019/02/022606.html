In this course, the instructor shows the interaction between static electric charges and static electric fields from Coulomb's law. Based on Coulomb’s law, he derives Gauss’s law and shows the concept of the electric field, the magnetic field, and the preservation power. Learners learn how the the static electric charge and the electric field distribute in vacuum, conductors, and insulators. Students can understand those with the same way as the concept of the gravitational field, the work, and the potential that they have learned in the dynamics.","expected_learning":"Students are expected to be able to obtain fundamental concept in electromagnetics.\n1. They recognize the concept of the electric field and flux as the vector field.\n2. They understand Gauss’s law and the application.\n3. They recognize the physical meaning about the relationship between the electric potential and field, and its mathematical description.\n4. They understand the static electric field in conductors and dielectrics.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.
