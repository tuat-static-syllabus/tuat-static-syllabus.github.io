Carbon can be connected long and linearly in any element, such as - CH 2 CH 2... CH 2 - (polyethylene), - CH?CH - CHCH -... = CH - (polyacetylene ), - C≡CC≡C - ・ ・ ・ ≡ C - (polyyne) and the like are real molecules. This long connecting property is called catenation, and only by replacing C with Si, these linear molecules (macromolecules) can not be established. That is, among all the elements, there is a high degree of freedom of connecting only carbon, so \"carbon chemistry\" = \"organic chemistry\" is content so much that it must be lectured separately. Therefore, it is essential to feed back the results of the exercise to the self learning and deepen the understanding degree. View the diploma policy of this subject: Please refer to the curriculum map of the course guidance.","expected_learning":"In this exercise, it aims to master the basic principle of the first half of organic chemistry lecture which is one of the basic chemistry learned at university.","course_schedule":"Practice exercises on organic chemistry I, II and III part. Presentation on the results of solving problems in a group of problems relating to several fields such as addition reaction, substitution reaction, elimination reaction, oxidation / reduction reaction, electronic cyclic reaction, discussion on it, and supplementary explanation Advance.","prerequisites":"It is assumed that you have taken \"Organic Chemistry I\", \"Organic Chemistry II\" and \"Chemical Bonding Theory\" that is being offered (has academic ability equal to or better than those of the unit creditors). In addition to class time, prepare and review according to our standard time.","texts_and_materials":"Organic Chemistry\nStructure and Function 7th edition Peter Vollhardt, Neil E.

Depending on the situation, there may be changes based on the fact that there is no disadvantage to students, such as additional evaluation of students who have made meaningful discussions.\n","message_from_instructor":"【IMPORTANT!】 There are many you mistake what you must memorize (according to certain rules) like nomenclature and what you must understand like each chemical reaction. No one can memorize all reaction forms that appear in textbooks (faculty members do not remember, too). Organic chemistry is not a memorandum subject. People who have relied on memory, so far, high school chemistry will always fail from university organic chemistry subject group, so improve your study method. There is no royal road to learning.","course_keywords":"Addition reaction, substitution reaction, elimination reaction, oxidation / reduction reaction, electrocyclic reaction","office_hours":"Take an appointment by phone","remarks_1":"Evaluation will be conducted based only on the results of the final exams, but it is not easy learning content that you can think of as \"it will do something by studying overnight\" so that you can acquire credits. I need continuation, patience, and a step to taking the first step.","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"3/19/2019 6:21:01 PM","name":{"id":631,"ja":"有機化学演習Ⅰ","en":"Exercises in Organic ChemistryⅠ"},"instructor":{"id":497,"ja":"米澤 宣行","en":"YONEZAWA Noriyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Wed.1","references":"Nothing special.
