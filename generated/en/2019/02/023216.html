Moreover, not only petrochemical industry but the organic chemistry product manufacturing technique and the global environment problems which took up the remarkable fine chemicals of progress greatly in recent years, and also used biotechnology are explained. Although it advances along with a text fundamentally, I take up also about the newest research-and-development topics in a company, and have you hold the image of the actual research-and-development business in a company. Since it is impossible, explaining all the contents of the text takes up an unclear place preponderantly an important place.\nParticipants should take “Organic Chemistry I”, “Organic Chemistry II”, and \"Organic Chemistry III\".","expected_learning":"Understand the foundation of the organic industrial chemistry from petrochemistry to fine chemicals.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"The 1st time Introduction: The global image of organic chemistry industry, and the difference of Mass and fine chemicals and the structural aspect of each type of industry are explained. Furthermore, the system of the organic chemistry industry from research and development to production/sale is explained.\nThe 2nd time Oil refining: The flow of the product from oil refining used as the foundation of organic chemistry industry to petrochemistry is learned in 2-5 times.
