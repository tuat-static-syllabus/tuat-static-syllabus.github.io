Earth, solar system and space developed last 13.8 billion years. The processes of those developments are also dealt by geology. The goal of us is to get the broad horizon which depends on geological temporal-spatial scales. And, the geological knowledge will become a base of thinking about disaster preventing and environment problems.\nThere are many kind of environment on modern earth and in the space. We will learn the processes of development of the earth and space. A quiz will be administrated in each end of the class.\n\n","expected_learning":"Getting the broad horizons which depend on the geological temporal-spatial scales.","course_schedule":"1.
