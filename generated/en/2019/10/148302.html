Development of such pharmaceuticals, medical techniques and daily necessities indispensably requires application tests using mammals having metabolic systems resembling that of humans. In life science and medical science, experimental animals indeed play an essential role in supporting humans’ rich and healthy life. Understanding will be deepened of the ecology and characteristics of experimental animals including rodents, dogs and monkeys, the ways of their routine handling and safety management, propagation and species preservation, and on that basis research coordinators will be trained in basic capabilities for choosing the type of experimental animal and experimental method appropriate for specific research needs. They will also learn correct knowledge on containment of biohazards.","expected_learning":"Understanding of law and guidelines governing research using experimental animals.\nUnderstanding of types and genealogy of experimental animals.\nUnderstanding of propagation and management of experimental animals.\n","course_schedule":"1st: What are experimental animals?\n2nd: Types and characteristics of of experimental animals\n3rd: Chacteristics of various animal tests\n4th: Law governing animal tests\n5th: Management and propagation of experimental animals\n6th: Biohazard theory I\n7th: Biohazard theory II\n8th: Bioethics inn animal tests\n9th: Mercy killing method for experimental animals\n10th: Mercy killing method for experimental animals\n11th: Treatment of large experimental animals\n12th: Propagation of experimental animals\n13th: Social needs and current status of animal tests\n14th: General discussion\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 15 times of the lectures, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Evaluated according to reports and presentations","message_from_instructor":"I would like to see students learn characteristics and correct treatment of experimental animals, and become able to choose an appropriate experimental system.","course_keywords":"Experimental animal, biohazard, propagation","office_hours":"2:00-5:00 p.m. on workdays (make an appointment in advance by e-mail)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/28/2019 11:36:18 AM","name":{"id":1508,"ja":"実験動物学特論","en":"Advanced Laboratory Animals"},"instructor":{"id":901,"ja":"田中 あかね","en":"TANAKA Akane"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering(Doctor)","category":"courses for the doctral program","department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Fri.2","references":"MAEJIMA Kazuyosi and KASAI Noriyuki, eds., Saishin Jikken Dobutsu-gaku (Latest Experimental Animal Science), Asakura Shobo\nKASAI Noriyuki, YOSHIKAWA Yasuhiro and AGUI Takashi eds., Gendai Jikken Dobutsu-gaku (Contemporary Experimental Animal Science), Asakura Shobo\n"}}
