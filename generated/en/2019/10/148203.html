The course will be divided into four parts. In the first part of the course, there will be general discussion on the macro level aspects of oral presentations that need to be considered during the preparation process. These include purpose, intended audience, organization, flow, style, and delivery. There will also be a discussion on the problems associated with presentation Q&A and effective strategies to deal with these. In the second part of the course, there will be a short tutorial on how presentation software applications can be effectively used to explain the background, methods, results, and conclusions of scientific and engineering studies. In the third part of the course, students will be required to prepare and then give an oral presentation introducing the background to their current research. Students in the audience will be required to ask questions during the question time session, and submit a report on their impressions of the presentation and areas they think could be improved. Following a similar procedure, in part four of the course, students will be required to prepare and give a more complete presentation on the findings of their research similar to that given at an international conference. As in part three, students in the audience will be required to ask questions and submit an evaluation report. After each set of presentations, there will be a general discussion and feedback session that highlights problems and areas for improvement.","expected_learning":"1.

At the end of the course, you will be expected to present this content in front of the other course members as part of a short five- to ten-minute presentation. One option for the content is to bring the materials you used to prepare the final paper for the technical writing course you have attended. However, you may also bring other content if you want. Please note that during the course, there will be no time to *create content*. Rather, we will be taking your already completed content and redesigning it into bullet points, simplified figures/tables, and summary slides.","texts_and_materials":"Course materials will be distributed in the first lesson.","assessment":"Students will be evaluated based on a portfolio of work comprising of:\n1. Materials used to prepare a presentation on the background to their current research.\n2. PowerPoint file for the presentation on the background to their current research.\n3. Materials used to prepare a presentation on the findings of their current research.\n4. PowerPoint file for the presentation on the findings of their current research.\n5.
