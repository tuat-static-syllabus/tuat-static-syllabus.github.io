The viewpoint of evolution is necessary to further understand perceptual and motor behavioral nature in the modern human. This course, focusing on the high-order brain functions of humans, will discuss the mechanisms of perception and motor control. It is intended to enable students to learn fundamental principles of human motor behavior observed in everyday life from the viewpoint of motor adaptation. In connection with the lectures, students will be required to read papers in the fields of neuroscience and experimental psychology regarding the role of information in the sensory system-intracerebral information processing system-motor system, survey knowledges regarding sensorimotor deficits, and discuss the significance of injury prevention and rehabilitation of disabled persons.","expected_learning":"The course goals are follows.\n1) To acquire a sense of researcher who can understand the mechanism of human perceptual motion control from the viewpoint of human evolution.\n2) To acquire the ability to discuss not only the main problems in their research fields but also \"human health problems\" from a broad perspective with researchers from different fields.","course_schedule":"1st week: Introduction: Evolution theory-oriented approach to motor behavior.
