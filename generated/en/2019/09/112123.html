Sensors are the indispensable components in such automatization of mechanical systems. Students will learn various sensors in this course. The topics covered in this course range from temperature, magnetic, and mechanical sensors to chemical and biosensors. Optical sensors will be covered in Advanced Environmental Mechanical Systems IV.\n\nThe topics covered in the course include:\n- Temperature/magnetic/mechanical sensors\n- MEMS\n- Chemical sensors/biosensors\n","expected_learning":"Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:\n- Explain the working principles of popular sensors\n- Select appropriate sensors for their own experiments\n","course_schedule":"Week 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Temperature sensors\nWeek 3: Magnetic sensors\nWeek 4: Mechanical sensors\nWeek 5: Position sensors, rotary encoders, strain gauges\nWeek 6: Gas sensors and electronic noses\nWeek 7: Chemical sensors\nWeek 8: Biosensors\n","prerequisites":"Basic knowledge on electronics.","texts_and_materials":"All materials used in the course will be provided on Moodle.","assessment":"Quiz posted on Moodle after each class (40%).
