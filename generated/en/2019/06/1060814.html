We will analyze some traditional BPs formats to understand the structure, meaning, and writing tips. Without such knowledge, prevalence of new ideas and technology or development of economy will not be achieved; commercialization of technology and ideas is a process that presents many challenges to overcome not only for individuals but also companies.\nThis course is designed to allow students to obtain the knowledge of BPs and business models and to learn methods to create new ideas. Additionally, students will gain experience in creating a BP on a new product or a new business in a simulated setting of a partner company through realistic examples. (Students are required to create a BP proposal of a new product or a new business and present it to the management of the company.) Students are expected to not just understand traditional, typical and systematized BPs but learn a BP of a new style and structure through experience in a case with the real company. The course should provide an opportunity for students to come up with a strategic BPs.\n\n　The lecturer of this course has the firsthand experiences on business management in companies and will discribe actual examples from companies for case-studies, analyses and discussion.\n\n\n<Notes>\nIn the first seven classes of this course, we will learn about the strategic BPs through lectures and the case method based on specific examples. The subsequent eight classes of the course will provide the students with an opportunity to create a BP for a real company.\nThe second half of the course will be in the form of Project Based Learning (PBL) with cooperation from the company.\nStudents who wish to take this course are expected to meet with personnel from the partner company with respect, maintain confidentiality of the company's information, and never cause any trouble to the company.\nStudents are also expected to attend all classes in principle and be willing to work outside the class hours (to do homework, survey, etc.). This is because the students will be divided into small groups for the PBL, where teamwork is the key. Unexcused absence or unfinished homework will hinder other members of the team from learning.","expected_learning":"Understand concepts such as marketing, resource analysis, competitive advantage, business models, return on investment, and implementation system on the basis of the actual case of the partner company.\nTackle various management issues by utilizing all the knowledge learned in the course, and understand methods to create new ideas.","course_schedule":"The 1st class [Orientation] Description of course planning, general discussion on BPs, etc.\n\nThe 2nd class [Lecture] Method of analyzing environment of companies, method of analyzing company resource, etc.\n\nThe 3rd class [Lecture] How to create ideas, how to utilize intellectual property information, etc.\n\nThe 4th class [Lecture] How to make a business model, initiative and entry barriers, etc.\n\nThe 5th class [Lecture] Investment versus effect, how to make financial plans, implementation system, etc.\n\nThe 6th class [Lecture] Analysis of specific cases of smalltomedium sized companies , contracts and business plans, etc.\n\nThe 7th class [Presentation from partner company] Company outline, business outline, explanation of management issues, Q&A <with the attendance of the management of the partner company>\n\nThe 8th class [Group work] Group formation, organization of information of the partner company, understanding of issues, etc.\n\nThe 9th class [Group work] Analysis of the environment of the partner company, identification of competitiveness, etc.\n\nThe 10th class [Intermediate presentation] Information organization and progress report, feedback etc.\n\nThe 11th class [Group work] Creating ideas to be proposed, creating BP plans, etc.\n\nThe 12th class [Intermediate presentation] Presentation of proposed ideas, explanation of BPs, feedback, etc.\n\nThe 13th class [Group work] Revision and revisit of BPs, finalization of proposals, etc.\n\nThe 14th class [Final Presentation] Presentation of BPs for the partner company, evaluation of BPs <with the attendance of the management of the partner company>\n\nThe 15th class [Lecture] Review of final presentation , Summary of strategic BPs, etc.\n\n* Students must attend the 7th and 14th classes because of the attendance from the partner company.","prerequisites":"Students interested in development of new products and the startup of a new business.\nEngineers or consultants who wish to improve the business acumen.\nStudents are recommended to prepare for and revise the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the university.","texts_and_materials":"To be distributed during the class in principle","assessment":"Comments on the presented BPs 40%, Confirmation test and reports 30%, remarks and cooperation in class (Aggressiveness and cooperativeness) 30%","message_from_instructor":"Results of PBL vary significantly depending on partner companies and group work, which poses uncertainties but is also a source of great fun.
