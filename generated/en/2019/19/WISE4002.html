More specifically, problems at sites domestic and overseas are identified, and techniques for solving those problems are examined. Students also gather specialized information and information from adjacent domains needed to solve problems, and learn through real-world practice the teamwork and communication skills needed to solve problems. By building up practical abilities and experience as engineers and researchers, students gain confidence to exhibit their real abilities while making use of the knowledge they have each learned, and this engenders flexibility enabling response suited to the situation. In addition, by recognizing how the findings they have developed in their own research are used on site, students learn things like vision to help spark innovation. In particular, students implement the content and themes developed in Practical Training in Domestic and Overseas I.","expected_learning":"Learn practical skills and techniques, integrate actual experience with specialized knowledge and research results learned at the university, and clarify sense of purpose toward specialized knowledge and research through training domestic and overseas.
