The aim is for students to acquire the ability to actively explore, identify, and analyze problems on their own, and then make proposals to solve them. This class employs mutual-participation learning. Industry needs are identified with emphasis on an international perspective, and discussions are carried out through group work. Through this process, a foundation is laid for activity as an excellent leader. [Overview] Students are divided into groups with 4?5 members each. Problems are set for each group while reflecting the general, overall theme. Practical training and lectures are undergone at partner companies, and problems are identified, explored, and analyzed through discussion in each group. Using the results, a final report is given at the presentation meeting. By setting different themes for each group, an effort is made to achieve a synergistic effect in problem setting and exploration. The ability to explore industry problems with an international perspective is cultivated by emphasizing both a global perspective and the industry's viewpoint.","expected_learning":"The ability to identify and set problems for industry from a global perspective, and lead exploration and discussion toward solutions.
