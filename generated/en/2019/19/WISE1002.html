More specifically, an overview is provided of nutrients contained in foods, and students develop an understanding of basic concepts of nutrition and their significance, and learn basic facts about processes like metabolism of nutrients. In addition, students learn about the connection between food function and illness, problems relating to food safety, and the importance of the food environment, and thereby develop an understanding of important issues pertaining to food and health.","expected_learning":"Develop an understanding of the nutritional characteristics and physiological function of foods based on chemistry and biology. Develop an understanding of the types of nutrients, their roles in the body, their metabolism and interactions, and be capable of giving an overview explanation. Learn how foods sustain health and are connected with illness, and deepen understanding regarding the onset of lifestyle-related illness, and prevention of illness through dietary habits. Use of these sources of knowledge to maintain and improve health, and prevent illness.","course_schedule":"1st session)　2nd session)\nClassification of Food, Variety of nutrients & These functionality, Nutrients contained in food\n\n3rd session) 　4th session)\nFood Safety (Food Poisoning, Food Additive, Food Labeling)\n\n5th session) 　6th session)\nScience of Taste (Roll of Nutrients in our body)\n\n7th session) 8th session)\nNutrition & Health (Relationship of Nutrients & Diseases, lifestyle-related Diseases & Prevention)\n","prerequisites":"It is preferable to have somefundamental knowledge of biology","texts_and_materials":"日本食品成分表 2019 年 七訂、医歯薬出版㈱","assessment":"Attendance, Attitude in the lecture, reports","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Health, nutrients, food safety, diseases, , lifestyle-related disease","office_hours":"Students will be notified at first lecture","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/14/2020 11:54:42 AM","name":{"id":2303,"ja":"生活科学概論","en":"Outline of Life Science"},"instructor":{"id":1804,"ja":"他分野教員","en":""},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"卓越大学院プログラム","category":"","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"農学府","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":"Printouts handed out when appropriate"}}
