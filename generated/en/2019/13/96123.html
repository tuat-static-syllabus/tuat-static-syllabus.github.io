In this class, background and new horizon of the research in the stem cell biology and regenerative medicine using human ES/iPS cells will be lectured. In addition, recent studies at Utsunomiya University in differentiation induction of human iPS cells in microenvironment of ovine fetuses for clinical application will be introduced.\n\nIn the last half of the class (Dr. FUKUI Emiko):\n“Domestic animal breeding in recent Japan and genetic diversity on wild animal”\nThe objective of this lecture helps students understand theory and application of domestic animal breeding in recent Japan. After teaching basic knowledge in animal breeding and genetics, I explain practical use of marker-assisted selection by analysis of candidate genes of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in Japanese Black cattle. In particular, individual identification, sexing and polymorphism analysis of marker genes are shown by our data using PCR-RFLP and microsatellite analysis. In addition, the population genetics and zoonotic infection are introduced in some wild animals: Japanese sika deer, Boar, and Bear.\n","expected_learning":"In the first half of the class (Dr. NAGAO Yoshikazu):\n“Stem Cells Biology and Regenerative Medicine Update”\n1.
