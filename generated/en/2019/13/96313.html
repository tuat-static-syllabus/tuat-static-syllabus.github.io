In addition, I also talk about structural variability of cellulose microfibrils and its analytical methods.\n\nIn the lecture, ‘key points’ are clearly indicated in the slide and handout. ‘Technical terms’ will be introduced kindly in the lectures. Students are encouraged to study using the ‘key points’ and ‘technical terms’, as well as data and figures provided in the class to build a systematic understanding.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to study plant biomass cellulose science. In addition, understand the methods for analyzing these mechanism.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","course_schedule":"1.Hierarchical structure of wood biomass\n2.Cellulose crystalline structure and its distribution in nature\n3.Cellulose biosynthesis and biodegradation","prerequisites":"Students have review and preparation for the class by using handouts and text.\nIt usually takes 3 hours for review and preparation.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts","assessment":"by report","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Biomass, cell wall, cellulose, crystalline structural analysis","office_hours":"Office hours is held after the class.
