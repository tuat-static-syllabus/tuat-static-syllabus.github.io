Especially, soil erosion in Okinawa and radioactive cesium dynamics in Fukushima will be introduced. As a hands-up study, you execute the numerical erosion model, Water Erosion Prediction Project, WEPP by using your computer. Through this numerical simulation, you may find some countermeasures for decrease soil erosion.\n","expected_learning":"1.
