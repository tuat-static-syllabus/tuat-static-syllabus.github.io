Amino acids serve as precursors in protein synthesis. Apart from being bound as proteins, amino acids also exist in free form in many tissues and plasma and act as important signaling molecules. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are the most noticed essential amino acids that have non-linear aliphatic sidechains, which include leucine, isoleucine and valine. BCAAs have recently been recognized as having functions other than simple nutrition. The signaling action of BCAAs has been well studied, and the mechanisms are currently under investigation.\nThe purpose of this lecture is to briefly review the current knowledge of how BCAAs act as regulators of protein metabolism, glucose metabolism and body temperature.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding of a key role for amino acids as nutritional signals in the regulation of a number of cellular processes.","course_schedule":"1. Regulation of protein synthesis by BCAAs\n　1-1. Overview of translation initiation\n　1-2. Regulation of translation initiation by BCAAs\n　1-3. Signal transduction pathways required for the stimulation of translation initiation by leucine\n2. Hypoglycemic effect of isoleucine\n2-1. Effects of isoleucine on glycogen synthesis and glucose oxidation\n2-2. Effects of isoleucine on glucose uptake in peripheral tissues and hepatic glucose production\n3. Thermoregulatory functions of BCAAs\n","prerequisites":"Prerequisite for this lecture is basic knowledge of biochemistry and nutrition.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided in class.","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"As BCAAs serve to regulate the metabolism of major nutrients, similarly to hormone, the value of their use as biological regulators cannot be overestimated. BCAAs are nutrients that should therefore be a focus of investigation as next-generation biological regulators. You will begin to look at amino acids in a different way.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Monday-Wednesday 12:00-12:50","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/26/2019 2:02:32 PM","name":{"id":1647,"ja":"動物栄養飼料学特論","en":"Advanced Animal Nutrition and Feed Science"},"instructor":{"id":1777,"ja":"吉澤 史昭（宇）","en":"YOSHIZAWA Fumiaki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"United Graduate School Agricultural Science","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":"To be announced in the lectures."}}
