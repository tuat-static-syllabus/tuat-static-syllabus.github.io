Color is important in the identification of different foods, particularly fruit, and also helps establish ripeness or freshness in most food. This lecture deals with the chemical properties of the natural pigments, chlorophylls (green), carotenoids (yellow, orange, red), anthocyanins (red, purple, blue), betalaines (red), and melanins (particularly in tea).\n","expected_learning":"Understanding the chemical properties of the color pigments in food.","course_schedule":"1.
