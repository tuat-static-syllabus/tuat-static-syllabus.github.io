Understanding of NMR and mass spectrometry methods for structure determination of small molecules/macromolecules (proteins).\n2. Understanding of next generation sequencing for biosynthesis research.\n\n","course_schedule":"1. Studies on toxic substance(s) from the mushroom Pleurocybella porrigens.\nPleurocybella porrigens is a poisonous mushroom that causes acute encephalopathy. In this lecture, the structure determination and biosynthesis research of toxic substances derived from this mushroom using NMR and mass spectrometer are reviewed in detail.\n2. Studies on plant growth regulator(s) produced by the mushroom Lepista sordida.\nThe structure determination of plant growth regulator(s) produced by Lepista sordida, which causes fairy ring disease and their biosynthetic pathway in plants are explained.\n","prerequisites":"Basic knowledge of subjects such as organic chemistry, biochemistry, and analytical chemistry is necessary.","texts_and_materials":"N/A","assessment":"The grade will be determined by an examination during the lecture duration.","message_from_instructor":"Please acquire basic knowledge on structure determination and biosynthesis research by attending classes and then consider applying it to your own research.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Friday, 13: 00-16: 00","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/25/2019 3:21:30 PM","name":{"id":1659,"ja":"先端生命科学特論","en":"Advanced Life Science"},"instructor":{"id":1785,"ja":"鈴木 智大（宇）","en":"SUZUKI Tomohiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"United Graduate School Agricultural Science","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":"N/A"}}
