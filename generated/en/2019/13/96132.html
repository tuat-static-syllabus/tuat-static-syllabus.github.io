What should we do to control viral diseases?\nPlant viruses are very tiny microbes that are composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) and surrounding capsid protein(s). The viruses have a few genes in their genome and use host factors for gene expression. Therefore, whether the virus can use host factors or not is very important for infection. Successfully infected virus can multiply in the host cell and move throughout the plant. Geminiviruses utilize host DNA replication machinery to replicate their own genomic DNA. But, if they are inoculated into mature foliar cell in which DNA don’t replicate any more, they try to interact with host protein to control the cell cycle phase of DNA replication. Thus, viruses take many strategies to establish their infection, and it is very interesting to analyze functions of viral genes. Elucidation of these functions will lead to development of disease control.\nIn this lecture, the basis of plant virology (e.g. classification, structure, detection), methods to analyze functions of viral genes, and methods to control viral diseases will be introduced.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding of plant pathology, especially plant viruses, and the meanings of technical terms.","course_schedule":"I’d like to introduce the basics of plant pathology, research and control method of plant viruses.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Based on report","message_from_instructor":"I will try to give a talk in an understandable way to students who are not familiar with plant pathology.
