In addition, since the obtained analysis results are provided to third parties as evidence on functionality and safety, it is necessary to guarantee reliability by objective means. Therefore, in this lecture, the performance required for the chemical quantification method of food components and the evaluation method of the quality of the analysis result obtained by it are explained.","expected_learning":"To understand the outline of the quantitative analysis method of food components, and to understand the performance of the analysis method and the evaluation method of the result required to obtain accurate analysis results.","course_schedule":"1.
