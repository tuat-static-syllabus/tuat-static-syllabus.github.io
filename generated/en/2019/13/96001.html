Each lecture is 90 minutes long, and 12 lectures will be given in 3 consecutive days. The lecture will be held in universities of united graduate school of agricultural science (Ibaraki University, Utsunomiya University, and TUAT.) at same time, so students will be able to take the lecture at their own university.\nThe lecture will be given in English for Comprehensive Agricultural Science II. The title and the teacher of each lecture will be informed later. If you are going to register this subject, please submit the registration form before the deadline.\nEvaluation will be decided by the number of lectures student attended. The attendance will be confirmed by submitting “attendance card” and a report for each lecture.

Please keep in mind that it is effective only in one term.","expected_learning":"To understand the studies and its applications on wide range of agricultural science.","course_schedule":"Lecture１ Application of symbiotic microorganisms for crops production\n（共生微生物の作物生産への利用）\nAkihiro,Suzki　鈴木　章弘　(佐賀大学教授)\nLecture2 Utilization of somatic cell nuclear transfer in mammals\n（哺乳動物における体細胞核移植の活用）\nKazuchika,Miyoshi　三好　和睦　(鹿児島大学教授)\nLecture3 Relationship　between Texture and Structure of Food: Rheological properties\n（食品のテクスチャーと構造の関係\n－レオロジー的性質について－\n）\nShoichi,GOHTANI　合谷　祥一　(香川大学教授)\nLecture4 The frontier in studies of moth sex pheromone\n（蛾類性フェロモン研究の最前線）\nNAKA,Hideshi　中　秀司　(鳥取大学准教授)\nLecture5 Can we simultaneously realize water environment protection and value-added production in agricultural areas?\n（農業地域の水環境保全と価値創出の両立は可能か？）\nTaku,Fujiwara　藤原　拓　(高知大学教授)\nLecture6 Rural Eco-engineering\n（農村生態工学）\nMORIYAMA, Takumi　守山　拓弥　(宇都宮大学准教授)\nLecture7 Nature Restoration\n（自然再生）\nAZUMA,Nobuyuki　東　信行　(弘前大学教授)\nLecture8 Morphogenesis and its control in horticultural plants\n（園芸植物における形態形成とその成長調節）\nKatsumi,Ohta　太田　勝巳　(島根大学教授)\nLecture9 The lipid world\n（脂質の世界）\nNISHIMUKAI,Megumi　西向　めぐみ　(岩手大学准教授)\nLecture10 Fire ecology in Japan; relationship between fire and plants\n（日本の火生態学　―火と植物の関係―）\nTSUDA, Satoshi　津田　智　(岐阜大学准教授)\nLecture11 Innovation of the apple industry which utilized the new fruit characters\n（新たな果実形質を利用したリンゴ産業のイノベーション）\nMATSUMOTO, Kazuhiro　松本　和浩　(静岡大学准教授)\nLecture12 Function of soybean saponin and health\n（大豆サポニンの機能と健康）\nSHIRAIWA, Masakazu　白岩　雅和　(茨城大学教授)\n","prerequisites":"required subject","texts_and_materials":"provided before the class","assessment":"It will be graded by reports students have submitted","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Please make an appointment","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/7/2020 1:43:12 PM","name":{"id":1628,"ja":"総合農学概論Ⅰ(日本語）","en":"Comprehensive Agricultural Science(in Japanese)"},"instructor":{"id":199,"ja":"高栁 正夫","en":"TAKAYANAGI Masao"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"連合農学研究科","category":"","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"連合農学研究科","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":""}}
