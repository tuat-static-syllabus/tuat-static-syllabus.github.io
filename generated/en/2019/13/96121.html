These cells are differentiated from a fertilized egg, then acquired the specific function during several developmental stage. In this lecture, the mechanism of cellular proliferation and differentiation with particular reference to characterization of undifferentiated stem cell will be introduced.\n","expected_learning":"1. Understanding of the concept of the stem cell.\n2. Understanding of function of tumor suppressor gene in regulation of the cell proliferation and cellular differentiation.\n3.Understanding of the relationship between cellular differentiation and the organogenesis with special reference to renal tubule, large intestine and tendon.\n","course_schedule":"1) Early development of animal fertilized egg\nA fertilized egg develops to morula, then early and expanded blastcyte by repeated cleavage. The cells which form inner cell mass in the expanded blastcyst is called as embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and these cells show pluripotency. Characterization of ES cell will be introduced in the beginning of this lecture.\n2) Control of cell proliferation\nCell proliferation is controlled by cell cycle and each check point. Function of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) complex in cell cycle and inhibitory effect of tumor suppressor proteins such as Rb and p53 family on cell proliferation will be introduced in the second part of this lecture. Furthermore, regulatory mechanism of tumor suppressor proteins on cell differentiation will be discussed.\n3) Cell differentiation and organogenesis\nThree germ layers including the ectoderm, the mesoderm and endoderm are produced in the vertebrate embryo. The endoderm forms the digestive tracts with the liver and the pancreas in addition to the lungs. The mesoderm forms skeletal muscle, the skeleton, cardiovascular system and the blood. The ectoderm forms the nervous system, the epidermis, hair, and mammary glands. It thought to be many kinds of somatic stem cells (tissue stem cells) between the germ layer and the differentiated cells, and various stimuli including cytokines and microenvironments are known to induce these precursors to mature. Among these, the topics of differentiation mechanism of mesenchymal stem cell will be introduced.\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"2/28/2019 11:33:29 AM","name":{"id":1646,"ja":"動物形態機能学特論","en":"Advanced Animal Function and Morphology"},"instructor":{"id":962,"ja":"新井 克彦","en":"ARAI Katsuhiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"連合農学研究科","category":"","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部附属硬蛋白質利用研究施設","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":""}}
