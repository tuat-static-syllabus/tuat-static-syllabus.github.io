Hypersensitive cell death, PR-protein production, lignin accumulation, and phytoalexin production are well-known examples of those defense responses. Among them, defense mechanisms by using low-molecular-weight compounds, such as phytoalexin production, will be mainly introduced in this class.\nPhytoalexins are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial compounds which accumulate in plants invaded by pathogenic microorganisms. After chemical structures and biosynthesis of phytoalexins are outlined, the role of phytoalexins in disease resistance mechanisms and counteractions of pathogens against phytoalexins will be explained. The recent research topics of rice phytoalexins will be introduced. Moreover, elicitors, which are known to be inducers of phytoalexin accumulation, will be explained.\nBesides phytoalexins, phytoanticipins, which accumulates constitutively in plants even before pathogen attack, will also be explained.\n","expected_learning":"Students will learn structures, biosynthesis, and related topics on plant defensive secondary metabolites.\n\n","course_schedule":"1.
