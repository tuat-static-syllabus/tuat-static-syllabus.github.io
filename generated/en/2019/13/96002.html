Each lecture is 90 minutes long, and 12 lectures will be given in 3 consecutive days. The lecture will be held in universities of united graduate school of agricultural science (Ibaraki University, Utsunomiya University, and TUAT.) at same time, so students will be able to take the lecture at their own university.\nThe lecture will be given in English for Comprehensive Agricultural Science II. The title and the teacher of each lecture will be informed later. If you are going to register this subject, please submit the registration form before the deadline.\nEvaluation will be decided by the number of lectures student attended. The attendance will be confirmed by submitting “attendance card” and a report for each lecture.

Please keep in mind that it is effective only in one term.","expected_learning":"To understand the studies and its applications on wide range of agricultural science.","course_schedule":"Lecture１ Current Research: Development of phosphor film for agriculture\n（最新の研究：農業用蛍光体フィルムの開発）\nNISHIHARA, Eiji　西原　英治　(鳥取大学農学部・教授)\nLecture2 Regional development by Agricultural Landscape\n-Case study of Yamagata Prefecture-\n（農業景観を活かした地域振興の取り組み－山形県を事例として－）\nWATANABE,　Rie　渡辺　理絵　(山形大学農学部・准教授)\nLecture3 Food applications of olive leaf\n（オリーブ葉の食品への応用）\nOGAWA, Masahiro　小川　雅廣　(香川大学農学部・教授)\nLecture4 Homestead Trees in Island Topography, its Cultural and Historical Context and Present Challenges\n（島嶼地域における歴史・文化的な集落景観及び保全の課題）\nCHEN, Bixia　陳　碧霞　(琉球大学亜熱帯フィールド科学教育研究センター・准教授)\nLecture5 Tillage operation and dynamic behaviors of farm tractor\n（耕耘作業と農用トラクタの力学的挙動）\nKISHIMOTO, Tadashi　岸本　　正　(帯広畜産大学環境農学研究部門・教授)\nLecture6 Chemical synthesis of artificial nucleic acids and their agricultural and medical applications\n（人工核酸の有機化学合成とその農学及び医学的応用）\nUENO, Yoshihito　上野　義仁　(岐阜大学応用生物科学部・教授)\nLecture7 Heavy metals and organisms\n（重金属と生物）\nWATANABE, Izumi　渡邉　　泉　(東京農工大学農学研究院・教授)\nLecture8 Environment of Aquaculture: Harmful algal bloom and fish disease\n（養殖環境の保全：赤潮・魚病とその対策）\nSHIMIZU, Sonoko　清水　園子　(愛媛大学南予水産研究センター・准教授)\nLecture9 Wildlife Ecology and Management in Yamaguchi Prefecture\n（山口県における野生動物の生態と保護管理）\nHOSOI, Eiji　細井栄嗣　(山口大学農学部・准教授)\nLecture10 How fish/shellfish parasites recognize their hosts?\n（魚介類寄生虫はどのようにして宿主を認識しているのだろうか？）\nTASUMI, Satoshi　田角　聡志　(鹿児島大学水産学部・准教授)\nLecture11 The Significance and Problems of the Contract Farming in the Developing Countries\n（途上国における契約栽培の意義と課題）\nANDO, Masuo　安藤益夫　(宇都宮大学農学部・教授)\nLecture12 Molecular mechanisms of spermatogenesis in mammals\n（哺乳類における精子形成の分子機構）\nYOGO, Keiichiro　与語　圭一郎　(静岡大学学術院農学領域・准教授)\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Provided before the lecture","assessment":"It will be graded by reports you have submitted","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Please make an appointment","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/7/2020 1:42:28 PM","name":{"id":1629,"ja":"総合農学概論Ⅱ(英語）","en":"Comprehensive Agricultural Science(in English)"},"instructor":{"id":199,"ja":"高栁 正夫","en":"TAKAYANAGI Masao"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"United Graduate School Agricultural Science","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
