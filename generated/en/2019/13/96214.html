Their structures and growth patterns are distinct from those of ordinary organisms. Now advancements of molecular biology and gene engineering help us understand the genome structures and gene functions of many plant viruses. In accordance with this, such advanced researches on plant viruses have led to developments of various virus control measures. In the former part of this class, I take up the use of cross-protection by hypovirulent (attenuated) viruses and the molecular breeding of transgenic resistant plants that are engineered to contain a virus gene (or a part of it). Some viruses have been attempted to use as virus vectors for expression of a foreign gene of interest in plant cells by incorporating it into the virus genome. In the latter part of this class, I show some examples of application of virus vectors to the production of useful proteins, breed improvement, genome editing and the like.","expected_learning":"You are required to understand (1) the basic structures and patterns of growth of plant viruses, (2) how to control pathogenic plant viruses by using plant viruses, and (3) how to utilize plant virus vectors.","course_schedule":"The basic structures and patterns of growth of plant viruses\nCross-protection by hypovirulent viruses (plant vaccine)\nVirus-resistant transgenic plants that are genetically modified to contain a virus gene (or a part of it)\nApplications of plant virus vectors\n","prerequisites":"It's better to complete the courses of microbiology (virology) and molecular biology.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be distributed and used.","assessment":"Report (100%)","message_from_instructor":"You may know plant viruses just as pathogens, but let’s study viruses that are used as useful tools.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"10:00 - 18:00（Mon - Fri）","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/18/2019 4:56:22 PM","name":{"id":1661,"ja":"微生物利用学特論","en":"Advanced Applied Microbiology"},"instructor":{"id":287,"ja":"佐々木 信光","en":"SASAKI Nobumitsu"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"連合農学研究科","category":"","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":""}}
