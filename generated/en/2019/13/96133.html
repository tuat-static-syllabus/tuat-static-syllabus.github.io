In most of the cases, individuals receiving certain environmental signals get to the expression of final phenotypes via alteration of internal physiological state. Therefore, endocrine systems play core roles in the regulation of phenotypic plasticity.\n","expected_learning":"By understanding various functions of juvenile hormone, which is one of the most important endocrine factors in arthropods, to become able to discuss how the endocrine systems can contribute to environmental adaptation and evolution of organisms.\nJuvenile hormone is a major multifunctional hormone regulating various biological phenomena such as molting, metamorphosis and reproduction, in arthropod species. In addition, recent studies demonstrated that juvenile hormones are involved in the regulation of phenotypic plasticity. In this lecture, I will summarize molecular basis of juvenile hormone signaling together with our resent research topics in which we mainly focused on the regulation of phenotypic plasticity by juvenile hormones.\n","course_schedule":"1.
