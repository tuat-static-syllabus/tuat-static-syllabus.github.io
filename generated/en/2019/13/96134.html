Thereafter they proceeded on to determination of their biosynthetic pathways. After 1990’s, studies on the regulatory mechanisms of their biosynthesis have been achieved by identification of biosynthetic enzymes by means of molecular genetics or biochemical approaches, which also enabled identification of signaling molecules involved in signal transduction of phytohormones. The results obtained from these fundamental researches have been properly applied to practical researches. In this class, I would like to talk about purposes, technical approaches, outcomes, and other aspects of phytohormone research at each era. For example, technical approaches include various techniques from different research fields such as ‘chemistry’ including isolation and identification of bioactive substances, syntheses of labeled precursors and their feedings, ‘molecular genetics’ utilizing isolation of mutant plants and their analyses, ‘molecular biology’ focusing on genes responsive to phytohormone action and as such. I would also like to give a talk on my own recent research.\n","expected_learning":"To understand the roles of phytohormones in planta, and how the studies on phytohormones proceeded from past to present.","course_schedule":"1.
