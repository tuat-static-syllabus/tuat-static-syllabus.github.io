In agriculture and the environment, motion occurs by the law of mechanics from micro molecules and cell levels to macro regions and global levels, and it becomes visible as a phenomenon as our experiments and observations. The purpose of this lecture is to study \"mechanics\", to analyze the essence of the motion phenomena of these objects, and to understand the applied aspects of physics such as energy based on basic laws. This is also a place in the field of agriculture to acquire the physical way of thinking that understands phenomena based on the basic laws, and to acquire the idea of scientific things that quantitatively explain phenomena.","expected_learning":"Students can understand the basic laws of physical phenomena and their ideas, and apply them to agriculture and the environment.\n\nPlease refer to the curriculum map of the University's website (three policies).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"(1) Why study physics? Consider the importance of mechanics in the field of agriculture.\n(2) Rotational motion of the quality point.\n(3) Rigid body mechanics.\n(4) The center of gravity and movement of the quality point system and the rigid body\n(5) Angular momentum of the quality point system.\n(6) Equation of motion and moment of rigid bodies.\n(7) What is vibration? How single oscillation works.\n(8) Exercise 1 (scheduled for May 29)\n(9) fluid dynamics. Fluids in organisms and ecosystems. Pressure in the fluid.\n(10) The properties of a static fluid, a fluid that exercises, and a fluid that takes viscosity into account.\n(11) Bernoulli's law and energy conservation law.\n(12) heat and internal energy. Energy conversion and utilization.\n(13) what is energy? Mechanical energy. Biological energy intake and energy metabolism.\n(14) Physical properties of water, evaporation and energy cycle, how to flow water, application to hydrology and hydrology.\n(15) Exercise 2 (scheduled for July 17)","prerequisites":"equivalent to the standard number of hours of the University\nTAT Physics I","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Evaluate grades at the rate of quizzes 50％, 1 (25%) and 2 (25%) of the class.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Physics, fliud dynamics, Energy","office_hours":"Making an appointment with e-mail in advance.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/6/2020 11:24:35 AM","name":{"id":310,"ja":"力学","en":"Mechanics"},"instructor":{"id":1404,"ja":"五味 高志, 岩岡 正博, 酒井 憲司, 佐藤 敬一, 加藤 亮","en":"GOMI Takashi, IWAOKA Masahiro, SAKAI Kenshi, SATO Keiichi, KATO Tasuku"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"general education courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Tue.1","references":""}}
