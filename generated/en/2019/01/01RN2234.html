This lecture targets 1) life history traits, 2) faunal regions, 3) relationship between mammals (terrestrial/aquatic carnivores, herbivores) and those habitats, 4) behavior, and 5) social system. In addition, the lecture involve basic exercise in mathematical analysis of animal ecology data using the statistic software “R”.","expected_learning":"To understand faunal regions (terrestrial and aquatic mammals), population ecology, food and feeding, environmental adaptations, and social behavior evolution.
