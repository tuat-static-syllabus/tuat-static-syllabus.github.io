Probably the most obstructive factor would be the problem of the absence of local leader. They know what to do. But, in the depopulation and aging population, everyone has the utmost to maintain their lives, who will plan their projects, start projects while securing people, funds and places, and sustain projects? One of solutions would be “partnership”, which is the project constructed by collaboration and cooperation of diverse entities, inside and outside the region.\n　In this lecture, we aim to grasp the current status and think about the way of “partnership” which is indispensable in regional revitalization, environmental conservation, natural resource management, etc. We introduce examples of domestic and foreign projects that governments, companies, NGOs / NPOs, communities, groups and individuals construct “partnership” and work on regional issues. After that, we point out their issues and problems, and discuss the desirable way of regional partnership. About specific lecture contents, this year we’d like to visit Harumi-cho shopping street and the Fuchu City Citizen Activity Center \"Platz\", and learn both practice and theory about collaborate with universities, shopping districts, companies, NPOs, administrative offices, etc. Finally, we’d like to share the results of fieldwork and discuss the overviews and problems.","expected_learning":"We will understand the way of thinking and practices of ‘regional partnership’ becoming the mainstream of regional activation.","course_schedule":"1st 6/10 (Monday) Tsuchiya, Asaoka What is “regional partnership’?\n2nd 6/17 (Monday), 3rd 6/24 (Monday), 4th7/1 (Monday), 5th7/8 (Monday), 6th7/15 (Monday) Hayashi We visit Harumi-cho shopping street and the Fuchu City Citizen Activity Center \"Platz\", and learn both practice and theory about collaborate with universities, shopping districts, companies, NPOs, administrative offices, etc.\n7th Monday, July 22 Tsuchiya, Asaoka, Hayashi Comprehensive discussion (discussion by teachers and students)","prerequisites":"Since this lecture will be opened in the second half of the same timetable as \"Sustainable Tourism\" in the same package, we strongly recommend to take this course.","texts_and_materials":"None","assessment":"Report point","message_from_instructor":"“Partnership” by diverse entities has great potential not only for solving surface problems but also for creating society.
