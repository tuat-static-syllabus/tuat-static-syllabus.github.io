Students will experience different styles of lectures and classes depending on the contents. It consists of two parts.\n\nPart I:Common Intoroductory Program\nIn this program that is common to all first-year students, students will learn about our university and think how they would pursue their academic life here. The university history and TUAT principals are described as well as our research activities, with the aim of encouraing students to engage in university study and to understanding the importance of desigining their individual univeristy life.\n\nPart II:Faculty-Specific Program\nIn this program, participants work on various problems on environment and agriculture by using elementary mathematics. The purpose of this program is acquiring indispensable ability and habit to students of science, that is, \"think of mass\" and \"get necessary data through limited data and rational reduction\" so called Fermi estimate.","expected_learning":"1) To Understand the aunomous learning in the Univesrsity, and be able to design individual's academic life at Univesity from broad prospectives.\n2) To acquire mathematical skill and mind which are indispensable to understand and solve environmental and resource problems.\n\nCompetency Development：\nInitiative and Autonomy, Leadership and Facilitation, Knowledge Creation, Presentation Skills, Mission-Oriented Research and Problem Solving, Academic Ethics","course_schedule":"Part I : Common Intoroductory Program\n1. About the University (I)\nBrief history of the University. Talks from the President, the Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, and the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering.\n2. About the University (II)\nTalks from the Heads of the Departments.\n3. Studying at the University\nDifferences between studying at high school and studying at univesity. Desigining your academic life at the University from broad prospectives.\nQuestioning minds that lead you to the depth of academic study and research\n4. Energy-saving and Safety in university life\nGlobal warming and emission of green house gas. Our effort in reducing CO2 emission.\nRisk management in laboratories. You action to ensure own and others' safety. Risks of harmful chemicals and proper ways of thier disposal.\n5. Research ethics\nCode of conduct for research integrity, and scientific misconducts. Falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism are discussed.\n\nPart II : Faculty-Specific Program\n6.-15. Students work on exercises of textbook prior to the class, and checking answers and discussion are done during the class. Namely, without preparation for the class, you cannot keep up with the class.","prerequisites":"Part I : In addition to 10 hours you spend in the class, you are recommended to review the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University for each class, to plan out the courses to take and design how you would pursue your academic activities ahead.\nPart II : Prior to each class, participants read some sections of textbook which are assigned, and work on exercises of each section.","texts_and_materials":"Part I:Handouts and exercise materials are provided during the class\nPart II:John Harte \"Consider a Spherical Cow -A Course in Environmental Problem Solving\", University Science Books, 1988","assessment":"Part I (25%)：Marks are given based on worksheets collected at the end of each class.\nPart II (75%)：Marks are given based on exercises","message_from_instructor":"Questioning mind is indispensable. Students must not follow uncritically what teachers and textbook say, but critical thinking and attitude is required.","course_keywords":"Part I : Questioning mind, Autonomous learning Part II : mathematical model, Fermi estimation, box model, turnover ratio, residence time","office_hours":"Part I : It will be announced during the class.
