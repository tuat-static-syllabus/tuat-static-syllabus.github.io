Biosynthesis pathway is learned in this course. And it is also learned that complex structure compounds are constructed from simple unit by enzyme. Finally “bioactivity is controlled by chemicals” and “how should we control the bioactivity by chemicals” are learned. In this course is not suitable for students having no interest of application.","expected_learning":"“Control of bioactivity by chemicals” is learned. And an innovation mind is educated.","course_schedule":"I. Biosynthesis and Natural products\n１．biosynthesis of hydrocarbons and sugars\n２．fatty acids, polyketides, shikimic acid pathway\n３．terpenoids, steroids, alkaloids\n\nII. Natural products and bioactivity\n４．bioactivity regulation products of animals\n５． bioactivity regulation products of plants and fungi.\n６． Natural products and antibiotics\n","prerequisites":"On the assumption that students have basal organic chemical knowledge, text is expounded.\nFinished basic level of reaction mechanism by organic electron theory\n","texts_and_materials":"Natural Products Chemistry (Takeshi Oishi; Asakura-shoten)","assessment":"Students who scored more than 60poitnts in all get passing grade.","message_from_instructor":"Natural Product Chemistry is overlapped with medicinal chemistry and physiology. Medicinal field is targeted human science, but Natural Product Chemistry is targeted bioactivity including human. To be a student having an innovative idea for controlling bio-function by chemicals or new material is expected by attending this class. It is not suitable class for students having no interesting practical application technology.","course_keywords":"Natural Products, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, Bio-synthesis, Practical Applications","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://www.ru.uec.ac.jp/e-bulletin/feature/2016/medical-optical-imaging.html","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/31/2019 9:57:57 PM","name":{"id":171,"ja":"天然物有機化学","en":"Natural Compound Organic Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":152,"ja":"牧 昌次郎, 千葉 一裕","en":"MAKI Shojiro, CHIBA Kazuhiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Prevention Research","office":"Bio-organic Chemistry","day_period":"Wed.4","references":"Biosynthesis Chemistry (Dainihon-tosho)"}}
