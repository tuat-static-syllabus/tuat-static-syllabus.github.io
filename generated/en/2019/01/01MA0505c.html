In this lecture, we will first learn the basic concepts of statistics, namely, mean, variance, standard deviation, probability distribution and so on. Further, we will learn the concept of interval estimation and hypothesis test using various probability distributions, and understand the basic techniques of inferential statistics. Each lecture will also incorporate exercises using widely-used statistical software to develop a deeper understanding of statistics.","expected_learning":"(1) Understand the basic terms and symbols of statistics.\n(2) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of given data.\n(3) Estimate the mean of population from the sample data using normal distribution and t distribution.\n(4) Perform a basic hypothesis test using normal distribution and t distribution.\n(5) Perform an elementary regression analysis.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\nURL:https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1.
