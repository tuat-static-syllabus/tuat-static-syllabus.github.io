In agriculture and the environment, motion occurs by the law of mechanics from micro molecules and cell levels to macro regions and global levels, and it becomes visible as a phenomenon as our experiments and observations. The purpose of this lecture is to study \"mechanics\", to analyze the essence of the motion phenomena of these objects, and to understand the applied aspects of physics such as energy based on basic laws. This is also a place in the field of agriculture to acquire the physical way of thinking that understands phenomena based on the basic laws, and to acquire the idea of scientific things that quantitatively explain phenomena.","expected_learning":"Understand the basic rules of physical phenomena and their ideas, and apply them to agricultural science and environmental fields.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\nURL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"(1) Why study physics? Consider the importance of mechanics in the field of agriculture.\n(2) Rotational motion of the quality point.\n(3) Rigid body mechanics.\n(4) The center of gravity and movement of the quality point system and the rigid body\n(5) Angular momentum of the quality point system.\n(6) Equation of motion and moment of rigid bodies.\n(7) What is vibration? How single oscillation works.\n(8) Exercise 1 (scheduled for May 29)\n(9) fluid dynamics. Fluids in organisms and ecosystems. Pressure in the fluid.\n(10) The properties of a static fluid, a fluid that exercises, and a fluid that takes viscosity into account.\n(11) Bernoulli's law and energy conservation law.\n(12) heat and internal energy. Energy conversion and utilization.\n(13) what is energy? Mechanical energy. Biological energy intake and energy metabolism.\n(14) Physical properties of water, evaporation and energy cycle, how to flow water, application to hydrology and hydrology.\n(15) Exercise 2 (scheduled for July 17)","prerequisites":"Students are recommended to spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University\nTAT physics I","texts_and_materials":"Yasuo Hara: 4th Edition Basics of Physics, Academic Book Publisher, 2010","assessment":"Evaluate the grade of quizzes (50%), exercise 1 (25%), and exercise 2 (25%) during class","message_from_instructor":"It is desirable that En students who take Resource Materials and Structural Mechanics, Forest Resources Utilization, and Environmental Resources Science Experiment I (Physical Application) take this course.\nRn students who plan to take soil physics, environmental geotechnical engineering, sabo engineering, thermal environmental engineering, vibration, agricultural land engineering, structural analysis, hydraulics, etc. should take this course.","course_keywords":"Basics of dynamics, rigid body, vibration, fluid, energy","office_hours":"Please contact each faculty member by email.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/6/2020 11:25:47 AM","name":{"id":310,"ja":"力学","en":"Mechanics"},"instructor":{"id":1404,"ja":"五味 高志, 岩岡 正博, 酒井 憲司, 佐藤 敬一, 加藤 亮","en":"GOMI Takashi, IWAOKA Masahiro, SAKAI Kenshi, SATO Keiichi, KATO Tasuku"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"general education courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Tue.1","references":"Physics Catalog: Visual Science for Photo Science, Kaken Publishing, 2006"}}
