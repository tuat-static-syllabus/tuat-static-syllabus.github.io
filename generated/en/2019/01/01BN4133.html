This class will learn balance of mass and heat, basic theory of transfer phenomena ( ex. flow, heat transfer, diffusion), kinetics of chemical reaction and sterilization in foods, and fundamental of food refrigeration. In addition, the quantitative risk assessment, which is a typical method for quantitative estimation of food safety, will be also referred.","expected_learning":"General goal of this class is to understand the principle of continuous thermal sterilization process for liquid foods such as milk. To achieve this, followings should be cleared.\n1) To calculate the balance of mass and heat in food manufacturing process\n2) To understand various forces acting on food and explain flow of running fluids in a circular pipe\n3) To understand three heat transfer modes and explain temperature change of solid or liquid foods when they are heated.\n4) To understand the kinetics of sterilization and solve simple sterilization problem\n5) To understand the fundamentals of food refrigeration\n6) To understand the fundamental of risk assessment and solve simple quantitative risk assessment problem\n","course_schedule":"Week 1 Class outline, the role of engineering in food manufacturing\nWeek 2 Mass balance\nWeek 3 Heat balance (reporting assignment)\nWeek 4 Heat transfer modes (conduction, convection, radiation)\nWeek 5 Prediction of heating and cooling process of food (1)\nWeek 6 Prediction of heating and cooling process of food (2)\nWeek 7 Prediction of heating and cooling process of food (3) (reporting assignment)\nWeek 8 Prediction of sterilization kinetics (1)\nWeek 9 Prediction of sterilization kinetics (2)\nWeek 10 Prediction of sterilization kinetics (3) (reporting assignment)\nWeek 11 Fundamentals of food freezing and food thawing\nWeek 12 Food processing techniques utilizing freezing and thawing, and leading-edge technologies in food refrigeration (glassification and antifreeze protein (AFP))\nWeek 13 Kinetics of enzymatic reaction\nWeek 14 Quantitative risk assessment of food (1)\nWeek 15 Quantitative risk assessment of food (2) (reporting assignment)\n","prerequisites":"Learners are recommended to complete Food Chemistry 1 & 2 and Food Processing.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided at each lecture.","assessment":"Reporting assignment (4 times): 100%\nScore distribution in the last year: A 100%\n","message_from_instructor":"The contents of this class are important and fundamental for not only food manufacturing process but also chemical and biological productions. To promote better understanding we will try including practice for solving basic problems as best as we can. We hope reviewing the class by utilizing assignments for many times will assist your understanding. This class requires the mathematical knowledge of high school level.","course_keywords":"Heat transfer, Heating, Cooling, Sterilization, Refrigeration","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"6/26/2019 9:52:30 AM","name":{"id":1792,"ja":"専門自由科目(食品工学)","en":"Special Interdisciplinary Subject (Food Engineering and Technology)"},"instructor":{"id":1366,"ja":"萩原 知明, 服部 誠","en":"HAGIWARA Tomoaki, HATTORI Makoto"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":15,"min":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Wed.2","references":"1.
