Originally organic chemistry began with the idea that chemistry of substances of biological origin, but now it is necessary to understand basic phenomena related to biology and all substances. In particular, from the viewpoint of agriculture, it is possible to understand the history of organic chemistry leading to pesticides and medicines by applying the chemical structure and function of various bioactive substances produced by living things. Also, in considering what roles agriculture plays in human society and the relationship between nature and human beings and how human beings can build a sustainable development world, it is important to understand what perspectives and ways of thinking rooted in organic chemistry is important. Department of Applied Bioscience completes studying about the foundation of organic chemistry over a year and a half and this \"Organic Chemistry I\" understands the properties and reactions of alkanes, alkenes, alkynes from the nature of atoms and electrons .","expected_learning":"Understand structures of molecules in relation to atoms, molecular orbits, hybrid orbits, etc. and the nature of chemical bonding, the principle of formation of covalent bonds.\nUnderstand the organic chemistry reaction with electron transfer and relationship between the influence of polar covalent bond based on electronegativity on the properties of molecules and the physical properties and reactivity.\nStudy the nomenclature of organic compounds, name of functional groups, etc. and the basic rules on organic compounds.\nUnderstand the three-dimensional structure of organic compounds and the mechanism of isomerization, and the transition of the reaction of organic compounds from the viewpoint of reaction energy.\nUnderstand the concept of resonance, systematically understand reactivity, structural characteristics, and various organic reactions.\n\nViewpoint of diploma policy in this subject:\nYou will learn a wide range of knowledge and culture that will serve as the foundation for addressing applied biological sciences and related domain issues, and acquire flexible thinking skills.\nIn order to elucidate the biological phenomena and interactions among living organisms and their coexistence patterns, and to contribute to the sustainable development of humanity, the systematics of specialized fields from the basics to the leading edge of applied biological sciences and related sciences learn.","course_schedule":"# 1 \"Significance of learning organic chemistry\": After commentary on textbooks and reference books used in this lecture, we will explain the role of organic chemistry in agriculture and the significance of learning.\n# 2 \"Characteristics of carbon atoms as the leading chemist of organic chemistry\": The special properties of carbon atoms played out among the main elements appearing in organic chemistry are explained. To understand this, we learn the concept of atomic structure, orbit, electronic arrangement.\n# 3 \"Hybrid orbit and chemical bond\": Learn about the concept of hybrid orbital and the characteristics of chemical bond centered on carbon.\n# 4 \"Polarity and acid-base\": Learn the relationship between the electron distribution in the molecule of the organic compound, the electron density and the characteristics of the molecule.\n# 5 \"Branched alkane nomenclature and functional groups\": Learn the basics of organic compound nomenclature, name of alkyl group, conformation and configuration.\n# 6 \"Representation of chemical structure and structure of cycloalkane\": To deepen the understanding of conformation and learn the structural properties of cycloalkane.\n# 7 \"Nomenclature and exercise of organic compounds\": Learn naming methods of organic compounds and solve exercises related to nomenclature in accordance with procedures themselves presented in textbooks.\n# 8 \"Introduction of research related to organic chemistry\": The latest research contents related to organic chemistry will be introduced.\n# 9 \"Types of organic reactions\": Learn the reaction mechanism of addition reaction, elimination reaction, substitution reaction, rearrangement reaction, along with electron transfer process.\n# 10 \"Reaction and energy diagram\": Know the meaning of the reaction energy diagram and explain the mechanism of chemical reaction progress.\n# 11 \"Problem practice\": Understand the fundamentals of organic chemistry by solving exercises summarizing ten lecture contents.\n# 12 \"Reaction of alkene\": Focusing on the reactivity of alkene, we explain the development to more diverse chemical reactions.\n# 13 \"Characteristics and reaction of alkene, alkyne\": Radical polymerization, resonance and reaction analysis based on its characteristics are explained.\n# 14 \"Properties and reactions of organic compounds\": We summarize chapters 1 to 4 of textbooks and explain the viewpoint to comprehensively understand the structure and reactivity of organic compounds.\n# 15 \"Summary and examination of lecture\": Explain the points of answers to the exercises on organic chemistry and carry out final examination.\n\n","prerequisites":"This course is followed by Organic Chemistry II and then III.\nCourse conditions, related subjects (information for preparing and reviewing, required study time ) is \"based on the standard number of hours of the university\".","texts_and_materials":"J.
