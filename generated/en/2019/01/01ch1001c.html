In this class, Physical Chemistry A, introductory thermodynamics which is constructed on the basis of energy conservation law will be delivered. In the class, processes which nature spontaneously chooses will be quantitatively discussed and it will be concluded that everything is controlled by thermodynamics.","expected_learning":"The first law of thermodynamics, energy conservation law, and the second law of thermodynamics, law of entropy increase, will be learned.
