Nervous systems can detect the changes, communicate between neurons and output as behaviors. The nervous systems form highly integrative networks to memorize the experiences and make a decision on the basis of the memory. For students learning on biology and agricultural sciences, the knowledge about neural functions causing behaviors and physiological responses are required. In this class, I introduce mechanisms underlying the transportation of neural information by a single neuron or between neurons, and the highly integrative systems based on the neural circuits.","expected_learning":"(1) Describe the structure of a neuron and central nervous systems\n(2) Describe the conduction of action potentials within the neuron\n(3) Describe the transmission of neural information between neurons\n(4) Describe the changes of efficiency of synaptic transmission\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n\n","course_schedule":"1.

This is because that neurobiology can answer not only the physiological function of human brains, but also feeling, emotion and mind of human. Let's imagine the neurological phenomena as our brain activities.","course_keywords":"neuron, nervous system, brain, bio-information","office_hours":"Please contact me by e-mail (sasakik@agr.tamagawa.ac.jp)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/28/2019 10:26:40 AM","name":{"id":181,"ja":"神経生物学","en":"Neurobiology"},"instructor":{"id":1363,"ja":"佐々木 謙, 森山 裕充","en":"SASAKI Ken, MORIYAMA Hiromitsu"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":14,"min":3},"neutral_department":"農学部","category":"","department":"","semester":"2学期","course_type":"2学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"","day_period":"集中","references":"「An Introduction to Biological Science Brain・Nerve and Behavior」 M.
