In this class, classification of pathogenic microorganisms, their nature and the life cycle, the invasive strategies of pathogens, and the defense strategies of the plants will be discussed. The relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and plants are also discussed followed by the discussion of the control of diseases based on the understanding of the relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and plants.\n\n[Overview] The major plant pathogenic microorganisms are filamentous fungus, bacteria, phytoplasma, nematodes, and viruses. In this lecture, mainly on fungi and bacteria, classification, morphology, physiology, life cycle and genetics are discussed. In addition, I will introduce the defense mechanisms to the pathogens in plants, strategies for pathogens to overcome the plants' defense. In addition, based on the understanding of the relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and plants, we will discuss on the possibility of controlling the diseases.","expected_learning":"Understanding of classification of pathogenic microorganisms, their nature and the life cycle, the invasive strategies of pathogens, the defense strategies of the plants, the relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and plants, and the control of diseases based on the understanding of the relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and plants is evaluated by the exam.\nIn addition to the lesson time of 30 hours and the above-mentioned lesson learning time, using the text to be distributed in the lesson, materials to be posted on HP and moodle, prepare and review according to the standard number of the university\n\nAs a viewpoint of the diploma policy, please refer to the following curriculum map of HPU (Three Policies).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"Class plan:\n1, Introduction\n2, What are plant diseases; plant pathogenic microbes and the environment; classification of organisms\n3, What are fungi?; evolution and classification of fungi\n4, Nature of fungi; mating of fungi\n5, Fungal diseases caused by plasmoromycetes and oomycetes\n6, Fungal diseases caused by zygomycetes and basidiomycetes\n7, Fungal diseases caused by ascomycetes (and fungi inperfecti)\n8, What are bacteria?; general nature and classification of bacteria\n9, Bacterial and phytoplasima diseases\n10, Nematodes, protist, plant virus and viroid\n11, The relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and plants\n12, Control of plant diseases\n13, Post harvest diseases and mycotoxins\n14, test\n15, Overview of the test / Methodology in the study on plant pathogenic organisms","prerequisites":"It conforms to standard time number of our university","texts_and_materials":"None","assessment":"evaluate how actively attending the class + test results.\nDetail will be explained in the class and in the moodle.\n","message_from_instructor":"It is interesting disciplines of mutual relationship of two organisms pathogenic microorganisms - plant.
