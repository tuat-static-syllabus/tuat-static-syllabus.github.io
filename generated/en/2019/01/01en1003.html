Human activities effect on nature via society, and changes of nature effect on humans via society. Without this viewpoint, it is nonsense to think environmental problems. This class provide students viewpoint to think root causing environmental problems and what we need to solve the problems. And, structure and function of ecosystem, which is fundamental scientific knowledge for thinking environmental problems, are lectured.","expected_learning":"Students are expected to,\n\n1. understand structure and function of ecosystem,\n2. acquire a habit to think the root causing environmental problems,\n3. acquire a habit to think environmental problems quantitatively.\n\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )","course_schedule":"Specific coverage will include:\n\n1. A viewpoint understand environmental problem\n2. The difference between \"Ecosystem Science\" and \"Ecology\"\n3. Structure and function of ecosystem\n(1) Fundamental structure\n(2) Natural ecosystem\n(3) Urban ecosystem\n(4) Agricultural ecosystem\n(5) Production and consumption of organic materials, and energy flow\n(6) Ecological succession\n(7) Ecosystem service\n(8) Odum's compartment model\n4. Food production and ecosystem conservation\n5. Hydrological cycle, afforestation and flood control\n6. Garbage problem\n7. Energy and ecosystem conservation\n8. Pollution and destruction of ecosystem\n9. Restoration of polluted ecosystem","prerequisites":"- Students are expected to join discussion.\n- It is desirable to download handouts and summaries and to complete an assignment prior to every class. Completion of assignments are not compulsory, but understanding the class is much harder if not.\n- Submitting a questionnaire every class is compulsory.\n- Handing assignments, questionnaire in at the end of every class is required.\n- Taking ecology and geochemistry is desirable.\n- In addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts and summaries can be downloaded from \"moodle\".","assessment":"Assignment: 30 %\nQuestionnaire: 30 %\nTerm-end examination: 40 %","message_from_instructor":"- Humans are supported by two environments, i.e., society and nature. Since this viewpoint is lacked in almost environmental science, people cannot find prospects and are confusing. I strongly expect students to be interested in structure of society causing environmental problems.\n- Questioning mind is indispensable. Students must not follow uncritically what teachers and textbook say, but critical thinking and attitude is required.","course_keywords":"ecosystem; material flow; ecological efficiency; ecosystem service; polluter pays principle; compartment model; tragedy of commons","office_hours":"10- 12 a.m., weekdays","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/15/2019 4:18:13 PM","name":{"id":223,"ja":"生態系管理学","en":"Ecosystem Management"},"instructor":{"id":189,"ja":"多羅尾 光徳","en":"TARAO Mitsunori"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"3-211","day_period":"Fri.4","references":"E.P.
