The bending Young's modulus of the metal rod is obtained by the loading method.\n5.Basics of measurement and handling of measured values\nLearn about calipers and balance handling and measurement error.\n6.Measurement of Joule's heat and thermal workmanship\nLearn the relationship between current and voltage, resistance and thermal energy which are the foundation of electricity. Measure the work cost of heat from the relationship of electricity - energy (Joule's law).\n7.Diffraction of laser light\nLearn about wave motion. Measure the wavelength of light using a diffraction grating.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Distribute experiment texts.","assessment":"Evaluate with 5 reports","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/18/2019 7:04:31 PM","name":{"id":312,"ja":"物理学実験","en":"Fundamental Experiments in Physics"},"instructor":{"id":1490,"ja":"大里 耕司, 中島 正裕, 山下 恵","en":"OSATO Koji, NAKAJIMA Masahiro, YAMASHITA Megumi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学部","category":"","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"3-208","day_period":"月3～5","references":""}}
