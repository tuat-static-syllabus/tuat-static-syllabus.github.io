However, if we remove the branch and focus on the trunk (abstraction), it can be explained by simple basic rules. It is the science of physics that systematically explains the common essence of various natural phenomena. This lecture focuses on the movement of objects that are full of our lives and the environment. In the fields of agriculture and the environment, movement occurs from the level of micro-molecules and cells to the level of macro-regions and the earth, and the movement occurs according to the laws of mechanics. The purpose of this lecture is to study the mechanics, analyze the essence of the motion phenomena of objects, and understand the applied aspects of physics such as energy based on the basic rules. In the field of agriculture, this is also a place to acquire physical thinking methods to understand phenomena based on basic laws and to acquire scientific ideas to quantitatively explain phenomena.","expected_learning":"Understand the basic laws of physical phenomena and their ideas, and understand their application to agriculture and the environment.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\n","course_schedule":"First half: mass dynamics\n1 (4/10) Units, speed and acceleration of linear motion\n2 (4/17) Speed and acceleration of general motion, uniform circular motion\n3 (4/24) The law of motion and the law of force\n4 (5/8) Vibration\n5 (5/15) Work and Energy\n6 (5/22) Work and energy\n7 (5/29) Angular momentum and moment of force\n\nSecond half: dynamics of mass system\n8 (6/5) Dynamics of Mass System\n9 (6/12) Center of gravity and motion of mass system\n10 (6/19) Angular momentum of mass system\n11 (6/26) Mechanics of rigid body\n12 (7/3) Equation of motion of a rigid body\n13 (7/10) Rotary motion and moment of inertia of a rigid body\n14 (7/17) Planar motion of rigid body\n15 (7/31) Test\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Yasuo Hara,\"Fundamental Physics\" 5th Edition, Gakujyutsu-tosho-syuppan","assessment":"Every short test(50%), final exam (50%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Make an appointment by emails, appropriately","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/30/2020 5:19:29 PM","name":{"id":309,"ja":"物理学","en":"Physics"},"instructor":{"id":304,"ja":"庄司 雅彦, 松本 武","en":"SHOJI Masahiko, MATSUMOTO Takeshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":1,"min":1,"max":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"3-211","day_period":"Wed.1","references":""}}
