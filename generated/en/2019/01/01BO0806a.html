Guidance on 9th April at room 1-25\n\n#1. Ecology of Insects I. (Yoshida T.)\nPurpose: Understand an animal-plant interaction by investigating insect damage to acorns of oak species.\nContents: Collect and assess the acorns of six oak species in Fuchu campus, and then compare them as insect microhabitats.\n\n#2. Ecology of Insects II. (Iwai N.)\nPurpose: Understand ants’ strategy against predators.\nContents: Collect multiple species of ants and compare the amount of formic acid.\n\n#3. Ecology of Plants (Hoshino Y.)\nPurpose: Field survey of plant communities\nContents: Description of plant communities based on the species composition, and some analyses using species diversity index and similarity index.\n\n#4. Morphology of Mammals (Kaneko Y. & Suzuki K.)\nPurpose: Examine general skeletal differences among mammalian species, learn how to do sex and age identification, and growth.\nContents: Observe wild boar skulls of a regional population, and identify those age by measuring mandible bone length. Based on the measured data, discuss about growth and sexual dimorphism.\n\n#5. Morphology of Vascular Plants (Akasaka M.)\nPurpose: Understand basic physical structure of vascular plants.\nContents: Observe and sketch several types of leaves.\n\n#6. Animal Body (Watanabe G.)\nPurpose: Using frogs as a model, students will learn the fundamental structure of animals.\nContents: Students will observe body structure of the frog, and make a perfusion model of the frog heart. They will observe heart beats and conduct an experiment to test effects of temperature and some chemicals.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/9/2019 10:32:50 AM","name":{"id":207,"ja":"生物学実験","en":"Fundamental Experiment on Biology"},"instructor":{"id":1374,"ja":"崔 東寿, 岩井 紀子","en":"CHOI Dongsu, IWAI Noriko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"農学部","category":"全学共通教育科目","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"","day_period":"火3～5","references":""}}
