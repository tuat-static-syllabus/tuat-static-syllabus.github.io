What is important regarding the market mechanism is “price” that functions as a signal reflecting the values of goods and services.\nOn the other hand, macroeconomics investigates the relationships among aggregate variables in economies such as gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, interest rate, foreign exchange rate, etc. Study on financial policy and monetary policy is also an important topic in macroeconomics.\nThe course focuses on microeconomics, because basic microeconomic theory would help students to understand the essence of each of various economic phenomena currently observed in the real world.\n\nThe lecturer of this course has substantial experiences as a consultant for agricultural and water resource development and will sometimes use the situations he had observed in rural areas to help students to deepen their understanding of the contents given.","expected_learning":"To gain the way of economic thinking, and to be able to apply basic economic theory, specifically microeconomic theory to understanding of various economic phenomena currently observed.\n\nCompetency development: Self-initiative○、Understanding of different cultures○、Global sense○、 Innovative thinking◎、Knowledge on science and technology○","course_schedule":"The course is intended to proceed with the following schedule:\n\n1.
