In this course, we will learn about differentiation and integration of multivariable functions, such as partial differentiations, criteria of local maxima and minima, double and triple integrations, and volumes of solids. Various computations will be practiced with drawing diagrams.\n","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiation and integration of two, or multivariable functions, and\n(2) to be capable of performing practical computations.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"1. Functions of several variables\n2. Ttotal differentiations\n3. differenciations of composite functions\n4. Higher order partial differentiations, and Taylor's theorem\n5. Local maxima and minima of functions of two variables\n6. Implicit functions\n7. Constrained extremal problem\n8. Exercises\nmidterm examination\n9. iterated integrations\n10. Double integrations\n11. Improper integrations\n12. Changes of variables\n13. Applications of double integrations\n14. triple integrations\n15. Exercises\nterm examination\n","prerequisites":"Knowledge of the course of Calculus I will be used in the lecture.\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"midterm examination 50%, term examination 50%","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Multivariable functions, Partial differentiations, Local maxima and minima of functions of two variables, Multiple integrations, Volumes of solids and areas of surfaces","office_hours":"after the class","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/25/2019 4:39:08 PM","name":{"id":307,"ja":"微分積分学Ⅱ","en":"Calculus Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":512,"ja":"直井 克之","en":"NAOI Katsuyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"building 12, room 226","day_period":"Mon.2","references":"入門微分積分（三宅敏恒）培風館"}}
