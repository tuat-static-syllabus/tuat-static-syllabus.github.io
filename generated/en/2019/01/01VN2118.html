However, radiation or isotopes create adverse results if the usage is incorrect. Therefore, veterinarians must know the correct handling manners and laws.\n\nThe principle of radioisotopes, radiation, x-ray generator, radiational laws, impacts to human body, and accidents of radioisotopes should be learned in this lecture. In addition, disputing various aspects of \"radiation\" through PPT presentations & group discussion (active learning).\n\nLecturer of this course have the firsthand experiences on radiation use and control. Therefore this course provides \"actual & useful knowledge\" of radiation handling.\n\n\n","expected_learning":"１）To understand the principle of radioisotopes\n２）To understand radiation impact to human body\n３）To understand laws in radiation handling\n４）To understand radiation protection\n５）To dissolve \"radiation biased view\"","course_schedule":"○There will be quizzes in each schedule.\n○There will be several reporting assignment.\n\n1st　　Veterinary use of radiation\n2nd　　Radioisotopes\n3rd　　Radiation and Radioactivity\n4th　　Presentation & group discussion (radiation accidents and nuclear plants)\n5th　　Presentation & group discussion (radiation accidents and human body)\n6th　　Presentation & group discussion (radiation accidents and animal products)\n7th　　Radiation units and dose limitation\n8th　　Oral and inhalation intake\n9th　　Radiation weighting factor and tissue weighting factor\n10th　　Radiation impacts to human body\n11th　　Radiation and thyroid gland\n12th　　Radiation protection\n13th　　Decontamination technique\n14th　　Medical use of radiation\n15th　　Direct and indirect effect\n　　　　Final exam\n\n","prerequisites":"○In completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.
