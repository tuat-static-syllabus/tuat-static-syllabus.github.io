Soils have typically been studied from three aspects: 1) their relationship to plant growth, 2) their relationship to engineering and environmental properties, and 3) their formation as a natural geological and ecological phenomenon. The goal of this course is to give you a broad exposure of soil science knowledge and concepts. This course provides basic knowledge for environmental sciences and is recommended for students of environmental resource department.","expected_learning":"Students are required to understand basic soil properties and agricultural and environmental functions.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\n（農学部の場合）See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )","course_schedule":"1.
