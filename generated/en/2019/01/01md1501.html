This course is intended to inquire into the concept of Kyosei, and necessary conditions and challenges for establishing Kyosei society.\nThe class begins with theoretical inquiry into Kyosei, followed by discussions on the present situations and challenges toward Kyosei society through a series of case studies of current efforts for the construction of sustainable society in Japan and abroad.\nWhat is “Kyosei ?” The class begins with this simple but difficult question. While pursing the concept and idea of Kyosei, we inquire into how Kyosei works in our current society and what are required for the establishment ofKyosei society. An inquiry into Kyosei is carried out by referring to several experiences. 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　The course is composed of two parts.In the part 1, viewing Kyosei as a contemporarily meaningful and comprehensive perspective of humanities and social science, we attempt to identify and assess present situations and challenges that society has been currently faced with and inquire into the needs of and conditions for the establishment of Kyosei society through a multidisciplinary approach.\nIn the part 2, first, focusing on Kyosei between nature and humans, we examine the role of agriculture in our current society and the examples of Kyosei in agriculture. Second, given the viewpoint above, we discuss the way in which sustainable rural development has emerged in developing countries, through a series of case studies of the rural development projects conducted by faculty members of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology.\n\nThis course is offered in English as one of the Multidisciplinary Courses of the Global Integrated Studies, and is open to students from Tokyo University of Foreign Studies and the University of Electro-Communications.\"\n","expected_learning":"\"The ultimate goals of this course are to improve the ability to think about various issues society has been currently faced with and future perspectives from multiple points of view and to deepen insights to understand such issues.\n\nCompetency development:\nGlobal awareness, Ability to Explore Knowledge, Communication skills, Presentation skills\"\n","course_schedule":"\" <Part 1>\n1.
