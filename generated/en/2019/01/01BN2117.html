Here, lecture on fundamental methods and concepts of molecular biology playing a central role in genetic research, and important research results. In the first half, we will give a lecture on molecular biology centered on yeast cells, which is a model of eukaryotes from a molecular genetic point of view, and lecture on research methods based on molecular biology and its application in the latter half. In the second half, we will give lectures on fundamental technologies concerning the handling of nucleic acids among research methods based on molecular biology.","expected_learning":"We will make it possible to grasp from basic contents to current topics about DNA replication machinery and genetic manipulation.
