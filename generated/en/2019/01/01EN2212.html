In addition to the conventional material design method of maximizing performance and minimizing cost, Eco Material is a material and design method that minimizes environmental impact throughout the entire process (production cycle, production, use, recycling, and disposal) . In this lecture, as a basic section, we will comprehensively and multifacetly describe the concepts　necessary for designing eco-materials. In addition, in the application section, we will describe the characteristics of materials currently considered as eco-materials (mainly materials made from wood and wood resources, plastic materials, etc.).\n\nThis course will be a practitioner subject.","expected_learning":"As various environmental problems surround, understand the basic idea of eco-friendly materials (eco-materials) and the direction that materials should aim.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"What is Eco Material?\n1) Environment and materials\n2) Structure and function of various materials\n3) Eco-materialization of materials\n4) Eco-material design of wood-based materials\n\n(Point of Course)\nI will brush my thoughts and sensibilities that can totally capture the achievements (positive aspects) and negative aspects of science and technology.\n\n2. Applied Officer: Omi\nEco-materialization of materials derived from wood and wood resources and plastic materials\n1) Basic concept of ecological materials\n2) Cascade type utilization of wood resources\n3) High durability wood\n4) Biodegradable plastics\n5) Environmental purification material\n\n(Point of Course)\nUnderstand functions as ecomaterials, manufacturing processes and recycling technologies for various materials.","prerequisites":"This lecture is an elective subject, and is one of the specialized subjects.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (30 hours).\n\nForest resource science, forest resource utilization, life cycle assessment","texts_and_materials":"Distribute the materials.","assessment":"At the end of the term, each faculty member's examination is carried out, evaluating the results of each faculty member as a total (average) as 20 points of normal points and 80 points of examination, and pass score of 60 points or more.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Eco Material, Recycling-oriented Society, Environmental Impact, Wood Material, Composite Processing, Chemical Modification","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"Dr. Kawarada will do it intensive lecture.
