Because the reactivity and other chemical properties are determined by their structure and electronic configuration. In this course, we try to understand the following points;\n1. Relation between electronic configuration and the elemental properties\n2. Relation between chemical bonds and the elemental properties\n3. Properties and reaction of materials in solid and liquid states\n","expected_learning":"It is required to understand the periodic electronic configuration of atoms and chemical and physical properties of materials based on the elemental structure.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"1. Atomic structure: Bilateral character of light\n2. Atomic structure: Structure of hydrogen atom\n3. Atomic structure: Electron configuration and the periodicity of polyelectronic atoms\n4.
