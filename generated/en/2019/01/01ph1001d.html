However, if we take off the branch and focus on the stem (abstraction), it can be explained by a simple basic rule. It is the study of physics that captures the common nature of various natural phenomena and explains them systematically. In this lecture, we take up the movement of objects that are full of our lives and the environment. Even at first glance, even if it looks like an object at rest, there is a law of physics, and it can be said that all objects are in motion. In the agronomics and environmental fields as well, from the microscopic molecule and cell level to the macro area and the global level, motion occurs according to the law of dynamics, and it becomes visible as our experiment and observation as a phenomenon. In this lecture, we aim to learn dynamics, analyze the nature of the movement phenomena of these objects, and understand the applied aspects of physics such as energy based on the basic law. In the field of agriculture, this is also a place to acquire physical thinking methods of understanding phenomena based on basic laws, and to acquire ideas of scientific things that quantitatively explain phenomena.","expected_learning":"Understand the basic laws of physical phenomena and their concepts, understand the application development to the field of agriculture and the environment, and lead solutions to the problem of mechanics.","course_schedule":"First half: mechanics of mass points\nNo. 1 (4/10) Unit, significant figure, speed and acceleration of linear movement\nNo. 2 (4/17) General motion speed and acceleration, constant velocity circular motion\nNo. 3 (4/24) Law of motion and law of force\nNo. 4 (5/8) Vibration\nNo. 5 (5/15) Work and energy\nNo. 6 (5/22) Work and energy\nNo. 7 (5/29) Angular momentum and moment of force\n\nSecond half: mechanics of mass system\nNo. 8 (6/5) Dynamics of mass point system\nNo. 9 (6/12) Center of gravity and movement of mass point system\nNo.10 (6/19) Angular momentum of mass point system\nNo.11 (6/26) Mechanics of rigid body\nNo.12 (7/3) Equation of motion of rigid body\nNo.13 (7/10) Rotational motion and moment of inertia of rigid body\nNo.14 (7/14) Dynamics of rigid body\nNo.15 (7/21) Examination\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Yasuo Hara: 5 edition Fundamental physics, Gakujutsu-- tosho publisher","assessment":"Attendance & short test (50%), examination (50%)\nNote: Students who attend less than 70% of this course can not get this credit.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Monday 16:30- (Confirm by Email)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/30/2020 5:19:58 PM","name":{"id":309,"ja":"物理学","en":"Physics"},"instructor":{"id":1489,"ja":"東城 清秀, 帖佐 直, 松本 武","en":"TOJO Seishu, CHOSA Tadashi, MATSUMOTO Takeshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":1,"min":1,"max":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"3-211","day_period":"Wed.1","references":""}}
