Isolate and purify material of interest from biological sample by liquid-liquid partition or chromatography, and analyze the property of the constituent by thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography. (2) Determination of the structure of organic compound by NMR, MS and IR. (3) Organic synthesis reaction. Students will prepare bioactive compound and its derivatives by using basic organic synthesis reaction.\nB class: (1) Analysis of genetic function of mutant drosophila. (2) Analysis of the gene expression system with reporter gene method. (3) Analysis of ectopic expression of gene in mutant fly. (4) Searching gene of interest using database. (5) Analysis and collection of protein of interest by immunoprecipitation and other precipitation system with selected binding affinity.
