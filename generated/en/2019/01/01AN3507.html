The goal of this course is to study case studies involving green tourism, regional brands, and endogenous development, while relating these case studies to theories of environmental economics or geography.\nIn recent years, improvements to databases, such as the agricultural census, have made it easier to analyze rural areas and to make maps using GIS. We will also learn the basic skills needed to use these databases.\n","expected_learning":"1) To learn about the theories and case studies related to rural resources.\n2) To learn the introductory skills needed to use a regional database.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"11/16\n1. guidance\n2.rural tourism (1)　\n3. rural tourism (2)　\n4. the theory of Geographical Information systems（GIS）\n11/23\n1. policy to conserve rural resources(1)\n2. policy to conserve rural resources(2)\n3.GIS: case studies (1)\n4.
