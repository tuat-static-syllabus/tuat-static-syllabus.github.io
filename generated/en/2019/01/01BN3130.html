I will teach you to learn from the chemical biology perspective, which has recently been established as a new concept in Europe and the United States. Through these, I think that you should think about what it means to acquire scientific thinking abilities and expressive ability = explanatory ability more widely and make use of it in future scientific activities.","expected_learning":"We can understand physiological phenomena of organism via low molecular physiologically active molecule. For example, the growth of plants can be controlled by: (1) regulation by biosynthesis of plant hormones; (2) acceptance and communication; (3) structure and action of unexplained hormones (new physiologically active substances), and grounds considered as hormones Learn ability to explain in a viewpoint, to be able to explain. We will use this as the standard reach criterion.","course_schedule":"Low molecular organic compounds typified by hormones are involved in the growth control of biological life phenomena. To understand how these substances are made in vivo (biosynthesis) is different from the one where organic synthetic chemistry combines human wisdom to create natural products There is an academic appeal to comprehend human wisdom by gathering wonderful substance synthesis ability. In order to interpret biological phenomena from substance chemistry, we provide molecular synthesis process (including molecular biological elements) and its control mechanism, reception of physiologically active substances and information transmission from the latest topics To go.\nIn this lecture, I will talk about the latest topics on plant hormones and the physiologically active substances that plants and microorganisms produce. In principle, we will also explain new discoveries and proof of facts that are not yet described in the textbook. Although I do not use textbooks, I will introduce some as reference books. In addition, I actually use scientific journal articles that I can download in campus. In that case, please download by yourself and try to challenge the content of the paper. Please use it to acquire basic knowledge. In addition, we will also provide so-called serendipitous topics that occurred in the course of chemistry research on natural chemicals and physiologically active substances. What myself experienced from what kind of idea or what kind of background the research that became academic development and breakthrough / milestone was born ・ The fact that my own researchers experienced [raw] If you can talk about and draw out interests in your learning, it is a real prospect.\n\n(1) Introduction: What is physiologically active substances? Introduction of characteristics of natural product chemistry in departments of science, pharmaceutical science and agricultural sciences.\n\n(2) - (7), analysis methods of biological compounds present in trace amounts, the chemical structure and physiological significance of plant hormones, the role of activated and inactive forms in biosynthesis, maintenance of endogenous amounts of active hormones, receptive mechanism of hormones (active substances)\nWe will continue the lecture while confirming the proficiency level.\n\n(8) - (11) explain the topics such as stories, biosynthesis, homeostasis, etc. leading to the discovery of new plant growth regulating substances (Strikolton and Culikin) about four times.\nIn (12) - (15), the latest literature is introduced from Proc.Natl. Acd. Sci. USA magazine, Science magazine, nature sister magazine etc. and topics are discussed. Finally we will summarize this lecture briefly, and do the test. The assignment will be presented in advance.\n\nIf you have learning, science, technology advancement, new discovery etc, I would like to introduce it by all means, so the content of the lecture may be changed.","prerequisites":"People who can prepare and review can take courses. Also, we will distribute the attendance table at the beginning of the lecture. I am thinking of the aggressiveness that I can describe and submit questions and doubts, points that I've learned to do by myself, etc. as a course condition.\nAs related subjects, organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetic engineering, plant physiology, etc. will help you to understand. It is possible to see physiologically active substances from a wide viewpoint. Both students who are good at chemistry and students who are good at biology are aiming for content that can satisfy intellectual curiosity.","texts_and_materials":"I list them as below. All books are written in Japanese.","assessment":"Participation / contribution: 40% (I would like to focus on the questions in the lecture, and on the way to the lecture with such thoughts. Please describe what you have doubts on the attendance card (Try challenging to find your own assignments. For high-quality questions and questions, we will explain them next time, but we will not evaluate them even if you write complaints and requests.)","message_from_instructor":"This lecture are presented in Japanese. People who is interested in this lecture should understand Japanese language.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/28/2020 2:58:51 PM","name":{"id":183,"ja":"生理活性物質化学","en":"Bioactive Material Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":162,"ja":"川出 洋","en":"KAWAIDE Hiroshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":14,"min":3},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Fri.2","references":"Articles published by high quality top journals (PNAS, nature and related journals, JBC, JACS, Angew.
