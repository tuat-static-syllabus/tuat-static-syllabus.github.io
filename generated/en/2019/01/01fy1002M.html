Students will experience different styles of lectures and classes depending on the contents. It consists of two parts.\n\nPart I : Common Intoroductory Program\nIn this program that is common to all first-year students, students will learn about our university and think how they would pursue their academic life here. The university history and TUAT principals are described as well as our research activities, with the aim of encouraing students to engage in university study and to understanding the importance of desigining their individual univeristy life.\n\nPart II : Faculty-Specific Program\nThis is a seminar-type lesson for first-year students with a small number of students on a specific theme prepared by the teacher in charge. Breaking away from the passive learning method of accumulation of knowledge that was mainly learned in the course of up to university entrance, learn the self-consciousness of the problem at the university and learn how to study independently. We aim to foster creativity, expression, and communication skills. In addition, I hope that they will interact with faculty members of the Faculty of Agriculture, which goes beyond the disciplines, and learn about the awareness and personality of university students, as well as the basic manners of working as a working adult.\nIn \"Learning from specimens,\" you will be exposed to the structure and illness of an animal through skeletal and tissue specimens, and what is going on inside the body of a familiar animal and why organisms will become sick.
