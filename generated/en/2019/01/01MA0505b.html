In this course, we will first introduce basic concepts and terms of statistics such as means, variances, probability distributions, etc. Then, observing the connection between statistical properties of samples and those of the population, we will learn methods of interval estimation and hypothesis testing.\n\nTakayuki Okuda (a part-time lecturer) will be in charge of this course.","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is to be capable of\n(1) understanding standard terms and notations of mathematical statistics,\n(2) calculating the mean and standard deviation of a given set of numbers,\n(3) applying normal distribution or Student's t-distribution to estimation of the mean of the population,\n(4) testing a statistical hypothesis by using normal distribution.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"１．Summarizing data\n２．Random variables and Probability distribution １\n３．Random variables and Probability distribution ２\n４．Bernoulli trial and Binomial distribution\n５．Normal distribution\n６．Sampling distributions\n７．Exercises\n８．Point estimation\n９．Confidence intervals\n１０．Chi-squared distribution and F-distribution\n１１．General concepts of statistical hypotheses\n１２．Testing a statistical hypothesis\n１３．Analysis of variance (ANOVA)\n１４．Regression analysis\n１５．Exercise\nFinal exam\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Exercises（30%）＋ Final expam（70%）","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Mean，Variance，Normal distribution，Sampling distribution，Estimation，Hypothesis testing","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"6/3/2019 12:37:43 PM","name":{"id":308,"ja":"数理統計学","en":"Mathematical Statistics"},"instructor":{"id":511,"ja":"奥田 喬之","en":"OKUDA Takayuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"農学部","category":"全学共通教育科目","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"農学府","office":"","day_period":"月1","references":""}}
