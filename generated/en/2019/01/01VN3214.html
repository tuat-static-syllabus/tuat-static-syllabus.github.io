In addition to gross observation of the lesions of organs and tissues of industrial animals detected at a meat inspection laboratory, learn practically how to conduct autopsy and observe pathological changes appeared in various organs throughout the body. By means of the practice in gross and histological pathology, cultivate comprehensive diagnostic ability of diseases. This subject is a course subject by a teacher with practical experience. In charge of toxicology, the instructor has experience in pathological diagnosis in toxicity tests, and gives lectures with examples of lesions in class.","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nPlease refer to the curriculum map of our university HP (3 policies).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\n1.

In addition to the practice time, refer to the training materials, textbooks, reference books, etc. that have been distributed, and do post-study to complete the sketch.","texts_and_materials":"Use Animal Special Pathology (2nd Edition), Color Atlas of Animal Pathology (2nd Edition), both being edited by Japanese Society of Veterinary Pathology as textbooks. Powerpoint documents will also be handed out.","assessment":"More than 80% of the attendance to the practice of the 1st and 14th times in each semester is prerequisite for the assessment. Degree of activeness in the class, submission of reports (sketch), and tests for histopathological diagnosis using projected pathological images will constitute 20%, 40%, and 40% of your final grade, respectively.","message_from_instructor":"Students should have studied well the contents in anatomy and histology classes at the 2nd grade, because knowledge of these courses is indispensable to them for conducting pathological diagnosis. They will use a textbook of Systemic Animal Pathology and also Color Atlas of Animal Pathology, both of which cover the contents in on-the-job pathological program.","course_keywords":"Pathological anatomy, microscopical assessment, histopathological diagnosis","office_hours":"13:00〜18:30.
