It flows out soil and sediments, generating the cycle of crust materials. Various freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes, ground water, wetlands create respective characteristic worlds, where biogeochemical cycling is working through life activities. Inland water is essential to us and all lives, but not a few problems are occurring with respect to its qualities and quantities. This lecture aims to understand the whole view on such a freshwater environments.","expected_learning":"Understanding the whole view on freshwater environments.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1: Introduction: things and concepts that is just born with the presence of water\n2: River and topography\n3: Ground water\n4: Water cycle and hydrological processes\n5: Chemical components in water\n6: Lake 1: Variation of lake and its structure\n7: Lake 2: Lake as an ecosystem\n8: Lake 3: Substance metabolism\n9: River ecology\n10: Ecotone\n11: Items related to water pollution\n12: Water pollution by anthropogenic activities/ water supply and sewerage systems\n13: Link of forest, river and the ocean\n14: Biogeochemical cycling in drainage basin\n15: Problems in fresh water environments","prerequisites":"This lecture is an elective subject, and is one of the specialized subjects.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (30 hours).\n","texts_and_materials":"None","assessment":"mini-exam (20%) and report (80%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Send e-mail to yoh@cc.tuat.ac.jp if you have any questions and inquiries.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/15/2019 4:33:21 PM","name":{"id":241,"ja":"陸水環境学","en":"Science on Freshwater Environment"},"instructor":{"id":232,"ja":"楊 宗興","en":"YO Muneoki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Thu.3","references":"Biogeochemistry of inland waters"}}
