However, ESD should not be discussed only from the viewpoint of environmental education. This course explores the possibilities of the study of ESD that overcomes the study of environmental education. It overviews the history and basic framework of environmental education and also development education, and considers how to learn in ESD through experiencing KUDEN or oral instruction/ inheritance.\n\nThe concept of environmental education, since it appeared in the international society in 1970’s, has developed into the new concept of ESD while connecting with the concept of “sustainable development/ sustainability” and also with the intention toward the fairer world that development education has been based with. ESD is a new educational approach that values dialogues and participation with a vision for the future. It places significance on learning of organization and society and situational learning toward organizational/ social transformation. It can be defined as not a new field of education but “alternative education” required under globalization to which conventional education should approach.","prerequisites":"None","texts_and_materials":"Asaoka, Yukihiko, 2016, “Nyu-mon Atarashii Kankyo-kyouiku no Jissen (Introduction to the practice of Environmental Education)”, Tsukuba-shobo","assessment":"Tasks will be given in each class.
