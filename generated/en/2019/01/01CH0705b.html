For example, You will understand the property of water and solubility product, which are basic backgrounds to understand the reason why particular salts are soluble or insoluble in water.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete the course will have basic knowledge of inorganic chemistry and deeper insights into chemical reactions. They will be able to (1) explain various properties of elements based on the periodic table (2) use various relational equations about changes of a substance and (3) understand the action of buffer solution and prepare it at desired pH.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:(A)\nSee the Curriculum maps.
