In the field of weeds, we outline basic knowledge on weed ecology, allelopathy and others. In the field of pests, we will outline the concepts of risk control of agricultural chemicals, philosophy of integrated control and others.\nThrough lectures in each field, I would like you to understand the fundamental thinking about crop protection, accumulate information and knowledge on various technologies in this field.","expected_learning":"Student have to understand a basic way of thinking about the crop protection and accumulate information, the knowledge about various techniques in this field and feed the underlying ability corresponding to the problem to occur on the site\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"Three teachers in charge (5 times each)\nOpening on April 15\n\n1 Outline of phytopathogenic microorganisms (fungi, bacteria, viruses, etc.)\n2 Diagnosis of diseases of plants\n3 Outline of disease control technology\n4 Outline of weeds science\n5 Outline of weed control technology\n6 Outline of chemical control technology of pests\n7 Outline of integrated pest management (philosophy and actual practice)","prerequisites":"Pesticide chemistry, bioactive substance chemistry, natural enemy microbiology, cause of the disease microbiology, plant pathology, insect physiology, insect biology, biological control, agriculture entomology, ecology, phytobiology\nIn addition to 15 hours of lecture time, students are required to learn lecture materials, international journal publications, reports issued by international organizations, and reference books to conduct self-learning before and after the class.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Attendance of 60% or more is a condition of credit acquisition.
