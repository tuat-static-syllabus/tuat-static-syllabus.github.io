Food and health are closely related each other. Recently, novel health promoting functions of nutrients (proteins, amino acids, fatty acids, carbohydrates and vitamins) and non-nutrients (pigments, fibers and flavors) are elucidated. The ingestion of well-balanced nutrients is prerequisite for health and the correct and precise knowledge about nutritional chemistry and biochemistry will be important for health. Such information will be useful for development of novel foods.","expected_learning":"In this lecture, the chemical properties of food components, the physiological functions of foods and metabolism of food components are lectured.
