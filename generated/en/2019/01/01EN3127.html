Environmental stress treatment on plants and growth analysis\n2. Mechanism of biodegradation of plant biomass\n3. Anatomical characteristics of vertebrates\n4. Mechanisms of formation of plant biomass and biological assessment and classification\n5. Transformation of bacterium\n6. Microbial degradation of xenobiotics","expected_learning":"1. To learn experimental techniques relating to biology necessary for environmental and natural resource sciences.\n2. To learn scientific writings necessary for science.\n\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )","course_schedule":"1. Environmental stress treatment on plants and growth analysis (Dr. Izuta & Dr. M. Watanabe)\nPlants are grown under the condition of water stress, and the growth and physiological responses of plants are analysed.\n\n2. Mechanism of biodegradation of plant biomass (Dr. M. Yoshida)\n(1) Cultivation of fungi by using a medium with cellulose as a carbon source\nFungal conidia are collected and cultivated in cellulose medium.\n(2) Measurement of activities of cellulose degrading enzyme in culture medium\nMetabolic activity of cellulose degrading enzyme produced in culture medium are measured.\n\n3. Anatomical characteristics of vertebrates (Dr. Ohji & Dr. I. Watanabe)\nDissection of fishes, and observation of structural characteristics and functional details of tissues and organs\n\n4. Mechanisms of formation of plant biomass and biological assessment and classification (Dr. Funada & Dr. Nakaba)\n(1) Mechanisms of tree growth\nObservation of tree cells, such as, lateral meristem (cambium layer, cambial initial) for hypertrophic growth, xylem in the process of differentiation and matured cells, and cells organising outer bark and inner bark (phloem tissue), and understanding their anatomical characteristics and mechanisms of hypertrophic growth.\n(2) Biologica assessment and classification of biomass resource\nParticipants understand that changes in density as the most critical physiological index for wood resource relates to structural ratio and form of cell types forming wood.\n\n5. Transformation of bacterium (Dr. Tarao)\nTransformation of E. coli by a plasmid with genes for antibiotics resistance\n\n6. Microbial degradation of xenobiotics (Dr. Tarao)\nMeasurement of the rate constant of degradation of p-nitrophenol by degrading microorganisms","prerequisites":"- Participants are assumed to have Biology, Microbiology, Fundamental Experiment on Biology, Microbial Physiology and Ecology, Environmental Microbiology, Environmental Botany, Plant Anatomy and Morphogenesis, Tree Eco-Physiology, Biodegradation (all are not compulsory).\n- In completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Download an instruction handbook from the portal site (noodle).","assessment":"Score is evaluated based on reports.
