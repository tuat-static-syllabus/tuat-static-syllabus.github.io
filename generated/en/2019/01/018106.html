Outlines of horticultural production and plant factory\n2. Control technologies for horticultural production (i) Temperature and humidity\n3. Control technologies for horticultural production (ii) Light and others\n4. Automation with mechanization and robotization\n5. Utilization of information and communication technologies\n6. Evaluation of horticultural structures as working environment (*)\n7. Case studies on horticultural structure and environment (*)\n(*) Marked contents will be given in a study excursion.\n","prerequisites":"In this course, 45 hours of study is a standard course for one credit course.
