Guidance, how to write a report\n1. Motion and gravitational acceleration of mechanical truck\nLearn about the gravity that is the foundation of physical phenomena.\nRecord the motion of the dolly moving on the slope and obtain the gravitational acceleration.\n2. Basics of measurement and handling of measured values\nCaliper, Learn about handling of balance and error of measurement.\n3. Measurement of Young's modulus of metal material by bending loading method\nLearn about the elasticity which is the basis of material mechanics. The bending Young's modulus of the metal rod is obtained by the loading method.\n4. Measurement of Joule's heat and thermal workmanship\nLearn the relationship between current and voltage, resistance and thermal energy which are the foundation of electricity. Measure the work cost of heat from the relationship of electricity - energy (Joule's law).\n5. Wavelength measurement of laser light by diffraction\nMeasure the wavelength of the wave (light) using steel scale or diffraction grating.\n6. Explanation of experiment and report ①\n7.
