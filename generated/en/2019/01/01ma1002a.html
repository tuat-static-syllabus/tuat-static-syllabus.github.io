In this course, we will learn the differentiations and the integrations of various functions of one variable and their properties. We will practice advanced computations in this course rather than in high schools.\n\nTakayuki Okuda (a part-time lecturer) will be in charge of this course.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiations and the integrations of various functions, such as polynomials, rational and irrational functions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions,\n(2) to understand how to calculate extreme maximal and minimum values of functions, and\n(3) to be capable of performing practical computations on determining areas of figures and lengths of curves.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )","course_schedule":"1. Continuity of real numbers and limits of functions\n2. Continuity and differentiability\n3. Formulae of differentiations, inverse functions and their differentiations\n4. Differentiations of inverse trigonometric functions, high derivatives, and Leibniz’s theorem\n5. Rolle's theorem and the mean-value theorem\n6. Taylor's theorem, and its applications\n7. Exercises, or midterm examination\n8. Local maxima and minima, and limits of indeterminate forms\n9. Indefinite integrals\n10. Integrations of rational functions, possibly containing trigonometric functions\n11. Definite integrals, and their properties\n12. Improper integrals\n13. Areas of figures and lengths of curves\n14. Exercises of various problems on integrals\n15. Summary\nTerm examination","prerequisites":"Mathematics in high schools (in particular, Mathematics Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ etc.) will be used in the lecture.\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Textbooks will be introduced in the first lecture, if necessary.","assessment":"Mid-term / Term examination","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Differentiation, Taylor expansion, Limit of indeterminate form, Integration of rational function, Improper integral","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"6/3/2019 12:38:46 PM","name":{"id":305,"ja":"微分積分学Ⅰ","en":"CalculusⅠ"},"instructor":{"id":1483,"ja":"奥田 喬之, 畠中 英里","en":"OKUDA Takayuki, HATAKENAKA Eri"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"3-211","day_period":"Wed.3","references":"Miyake Toshitsune, “Nyuumon-Bibun-Sekibun”, Baifu-kan (in Jananese)"}}
