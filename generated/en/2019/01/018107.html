Plant Ecology related to environment and agriculture will be discussed. How and why species adapted to the environment and made diverse existence (Biodiversity) will be discussed. Food and useful bioactive chemicals as a most important value of biodiversity will be explained. The current status of risk assessment and management of invasive alien plants will also be discussed. Allelopathy and Chemical Ecology will be explained, as this is a major research topic of teacher (Fujii).","expected_learning":"Obtain basic knowledge of Agricultural and Environmental Plant Ecology and Allelopathy","course_schedule":"1.
