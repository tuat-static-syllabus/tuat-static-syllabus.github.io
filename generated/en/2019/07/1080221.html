In this lecture, students will learn how to consider about chemical reaction (reaction transfer phenomena) to be handled together with transfer phenomena (momentum, heat, and movement of matter). The momentum transfer phenomenon of single-component systems (hydrodynamics) and the movement phenomena involving reactions of multicomponent systems are explained, and the analysis methods of various reaction transfer phenomena are explained. The analysis methods include theoretical analysis and numerical analysis. In numerical analysis, a program is actually created.","expected_learning":"1. to understand Chapter 3 of Transport Phenomena\n2. to understand the English language of the academic terms related to the movement phenomenon\n3. to understand how to handle the transfer phenomenon of multicomponent systems.\n4. to understand the basics of numerical analysis of multicomponent reaction transfer phenomena.\n5.
