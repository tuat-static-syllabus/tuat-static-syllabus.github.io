Also, along with an introduction of the faculty members of the Joint Program, lectures will be given on common research ethics that all students must understand in the conduct of their doctoral research.\n","expected_learning":"Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to:\n1. improve their interdisciplinary creativity and practice their presentation skills\n2. understand common research ethics in the conduct of their doctoral research\n","course_schedule":"　In this practicum, all full-time faculty and students enrolled in the Joint Program will together attend lectures in a collaborative humanities and sciences colloquium format. The triplet research supervision scheme for each student will be discussed and decided in the collaborative humanities and sciences colloquium, after which students will report their doctoral dissertation research concept, and Q&A sessions regarding the reports will be held. The practicum will be held in two intensive sessions.\n　The first colloquium will be held immediately after students enter the program. Students will report and hold Q&A on their research theme and select two assistant supervisors after receiving advice and comments from assistant supervisor candidates. Also, in the colloquium, along with an introduction of the faculty members of the Joint Program, lectures will be given on common research ethics that all students must understand in the conduct of their doctoral research.\n　The 2nd colloquium will be held after completing courses in the first semester. Students will report and hold Q&A sessions on their research concept, by incorporating the knowledge and achievements for each of the phases of \"comprehension, analysis, and implementation\" that they have gained through the \"Interdisciplinary Seminar I\" course.\n\n　The following are the fields of specialization of faculty members in the Joint Program:\n\nTokyo University of Foreign Studies (TUFS):\nShinichi Takeuchi: Area studies, African studies, international relations, conflict\nChikako Nakayama: Global studies, socioeconomics, socioeconomic thought, economic history, economic anthropology\nHyoduk Lee: Cultural studies, studies of culture and representation, postcolonialism\n\nTokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT):\nAtsushi Chitose: International agricultural development, agricultural development theory, agricultural economics, income disparity, poverty\nYoshiro Nomura: Biological resources functional chemistry, collagen, keratin, functional food\nHiroko Katori: Energy science, phase transition phenomena in magnetic materials, localized spin magnetism, itinerant electron magnetism\nKazuhiko Misawa: Biomedical engineering, ultrafast photonics, ultrafast time-resolved spectral diffraction, nonlinear optics\n\nThe University of Electro-Communications (UEC):\nKayoko Yamamoto: Social systems engineering, spatial information science, urban and regional planning, GIS big data, environment and disaster prevention\nTomonori Hashiyama: Intelligent information science, soft computing, human interface and interactions\nHiroshi Yokoi: Measurement/control engineering, power-saving artificial arm, power-saving sensors, cybernetics, clinical applications\nYoshiko Okada-Shudo: Optical engineering, optoelectronics, bioelectronics, nanophotonics\n","prerequisites":"Prior to the 2nd colloquium, the students must prepare their own research concept through the \"Interdisciplinary Seminar I\" course.\nYou are recommended to prepare for, and review, the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University for each class.\n","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Cooperative research presentation 60%\nParticipation and discussion 40%\nThe reports and Q&A sessions for each student in the 2nd colloquium will be evaluated by all participants.
