Students will learn the basic methods and principles in finding scientific evidence. In particular, lectures will deal with the basic theories in social mathematics (statistics, economics, etc.), experimental design and analysis, systems engineering, artificial intelligence, etc., as well as with analysis methods that have wide-ranging applications in the real world, such as big data analysis, GIS, and cost-benefit analysis. Also, in order to deepen understanding of content regarding scientific literacy and analysis methods learned in the lectures, case study workshops will be held along with the lectures.\n　The 2nd part (proposal writing workshops) is aimed at mastering practical techniques in writing English papers. In particular, as introduction to a proposal, students will individually write an abstract on an assigned theme, and in the process, check, evaluate, and improve the written contents as necessary, and submit a final draft, after gaining an understanding of the essential points in English proposal writing (including important pointers and rules) as well as of the characteristics of humanities/social sciences and natural sciences.\n　Lectures will be given in English, while practicum sessions, seminars, and workshops will be held both in English and Japanese depending on the students’ skill levels. The combined use of English and Japanese will be done in such a way as to avoid any disadvantage to students who do not understand Japanese.\n","expected_learning":"The learning outcomes for this course include the following:\n1. gain analytical abilities useful in articulating logical and pluralistic ways of thinking called for in international settings.\n2. demonstrate basic theories, practical skills and effective English writing techniques for formulating and implementing international development strategies and plans.\n","course_schedule":"1st Part (Lecture and Practicum)\n(1)\n- science, technology, society, research ethics\n- principles and foundations of social mathematics (statistics, economics)\n(2)\n- foundations of experimental design and analysis\n- foundations and applications of applied optical technologies\n(3)\n- foundations of cyborg systems\n- foundations of artificial intelligence\n(4)\n- foundations and uses of big data analysis/GIS (Geographical Information Systems)\n- risk analysis, cost-benefit analysis\n\n2nd Part (Proposal Writing Workshops)\n(5)\n- proposal writing techniques: overview\n(6)\n- Q&A regarding progress and content of proposals prepared by students\n","prerequisites":"You are recommended to prepare for, and review, the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University for each class.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Paper 60%\nParticipation and presentation 40%\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"sustainability research, proposal writing","office_hours":"On demand.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/6/2019 5:52:01 AM","name":{"id":2272,"ja":"サステイナビリティ研究基礎B","en":"Foundations of Sustainability Research B"},"instructor":{"id":535,"ja":"香取 浩子","en":"KATORI Hiroko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"工学府博士後期","category":"後期課程科目","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":"To be distributed and introduced in each class."}}
