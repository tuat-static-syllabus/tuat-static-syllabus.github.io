The electronic excitation, such as soliton, polaron, and bipolaron, and their localization are studied theoretically. The mechanisms of electric conduction is also explained. Further, some applications, LED, FET, and solar panel, are introduced.","expected_learning":"Electronic structure and origin of conduction of conducting polymer are learned.","course_schedule":"1.
