In all fields such as elementary particles, the universe, atoms and molecules, solid physics, and physics of continuum, symmetry always comes out. In this lecture, we introduce the basics of group theory, which is mathematics for describing the concept of symmetry, and apply it to concrete physical systems.\n\nGoal:\n(1) Master the basics of mathematics (group theory) that describes the concept of symmetry.\n(2) Review crystallography, quantum mechanics, molecular / lattice vibration, band theory, tensor amount, etc. from the point of view of symmetry.\n\nThis subject is one of the required compulsory subjects.\n","expected_learning":"1) To understand and explain mathematical concepts (group theory) expressing symmetry.\n2) Classification of solid crystals from the viewpoint of symmetry.\n3) To be able to classify quantum mechanical problems from the viewpoint of symmetry.\n4) To understand and explain the relation between the symmetry of crystals and the symmetry of physical property parameters.\n\nView the diploma policy of this subject: Please refer to the curriculum map of the course guidance.","course_schedule":"1.
