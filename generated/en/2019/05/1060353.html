Four students make one stirling engine in this practice using varieties of advanced machine tool which are installed in the Center of Design and Manufacturing. Then students deepen their understanding of the machining principle of machine tool and mastery of operating of that.\nAnd this practice doubles as a training for a teaching assistant as an educational activity support program for the Special Study on Mechanical Systems I which is held for freshmen in the fall semester. The student scheduled to be a teaching assistant receives a substantial training to be able to teach the safe and high accuracy machining. Furthermore this practice is a summer several-day intension practice.\n","expected_learning":"(1) Students should be able to understand the machining principle of machine tool. Then students are well versed in operating machine tool and machine the parts which satisfy the required accuracy.\n(2) Students scheduled as the teaching assistant for the Special Study on Mechanical Systems I should be able to understand well about the guideline for machining in their charge. Then they give training with paying close attention to the safety of freshmen who are beginners of machining.\n","course_schedule":"Students deepen their practical understanding of the guideline (Procedures of machine tool, Explanations, Safety measures, other Notes, etc.) for a teaching assistant and verse themselves in the guideline through the practice of machining and assembling parts of stirling engine with varieties of machine tool as follows.\n\n(1) 　Lathe\n(2) 　Milling machine, Machining Center, CNC Multitasking Machine\n(3) 　Wire electric discharge machine, Injection Molding Machine・Die and mold, Fine cutter\n(4) 　 Machining Center (Robo-drill), Drilling machine, Handwork\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Textbook and materials of work are distributed freely.","assessment":"Performance is evaluated by the attitude in practice, contents of report and deadline for submission, etc.\n\n","message_from_instructor":"Keep yourself in perfect condition and make thorough preparations for attendance because the practice is a short intensive one in the season of summer. Regarding the safety, follow absolutely instructions of teacher in the practice.","course_keywords":"“Mono-zukuri”, Craftsmanship, Machining, Machine tool, Assembling, Stirling engine, Safety","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"Using sandals is strictly prohibited.
