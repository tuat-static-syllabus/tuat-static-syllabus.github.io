The timescale signal is not only generated but also compared to world standard time (UTC), and disseminated to society. The method and capability of these activity will be also described. Furthermore, we will introduce highly accurate clocks, namely optical clocks which lose or gain one second in more than 560 million years. To learn the basic of this technology, students will learn that quantum mechanics or Fourier analysis that you learned in the class indeed works in cutting edge research activities. The final day is assigned for a tour to NICT, where you will see a system of JST as well as optical clocks and satellite system to maintain the synchronization of JST to UTC.","expected_learning":"To understand methods to express the phase noise or frequency stability of an oscillator\nTo know how various atomic clocks work.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1st day\na) History of standard time\nb) Japan Standard Time\n2nd day\na) Allan standard deviation and phase noise\nb) Optical frequency measurement\n3rd day\na) Spectroscopy of atoms\nb) Optical atomic clocks\nc) Time and frequency transfer in short and long distances\n4th day\na) Microwave atomic frequency standard\nb) Chip scale atomic clock\n5th day\na) Lab tour to the JST system, satellite time and frequency comparison system, and optical clocks","prerequisites":"Knowledge in the basic of quantume mechanics and skill for basic physical mathematics such as Fourier transform.\n\nStudents are recommended to prepare for each subject, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Effort and report 60%, examination 40%","message_from_instructor":"While the lecture is extensive for one day (three time bin), we hope students become familiar with time and frequency by positively participating the class.","course_keywords":"Atomic clock, Japan Standard Time, phase noise, frequency stability","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"6/6/2019 11:28:15 AM","name":{"id":1199,"ja":"物理システム特別講義Ⅲ","en":"Advanced Topics in Applied Physics Ⅲ"},"instructor":{"id":1712,"ja":"蜂須 英和, 村山 能宏","en":"HACHISU Hidekazu, MURAYAMA Yoshihiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"common courses","department":"","semester":"2nd","course_type":"2nd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
