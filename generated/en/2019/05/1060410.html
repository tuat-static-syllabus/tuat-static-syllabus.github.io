It took almost 50 years to reach the microscopic understanding of this phenomenon by Bardeen-Cooper-Shrieffer (BCS) in 1957. As expected by this long history, it is not easy to imagine the BCS state, the essence of the theory. This is not only due to the advanced quantum mechanics based on the second quantization (quantum field theory) required but also due to the concept of macroscopic quantum state. The lecture of advanced superconductivity aims at understanding the phenomena and basic physics of superconductivity.\n","expected_learning":"The goals of advanced superconductivity are\n(1) to understand the phenomnological Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity,\n(2) to understand the basics of the micoscopic BCS theory of superconductivity.","course_schedule":"Week1　What is superconductivity?\nWeek2　Themodynamics of superconductivity, critical magnetic fields\nWeek3 Landau theory of the second-order phase transition\nWeek4 Fluctuations and correlations\nWeek5 Phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory\nTask1\n\nWeek6 Lattice vibrations and phonns\nWeek7 Creation and destruction operators\nWeek8 Many electron systems\nWeek9 Electron-phonon interaction\nWeek10 Cooper pairing and the basics of the BCS theory\nTask2\n\nWeek11 Bose and Fermi statistics\nWeek12 Bose-Einstein condensation\nWeek13 Copuscle and wave\nWeek14 Macroscopic quantum coherence\nWeek15 Why superfluidty takes place?\nFinal exam.\n\n","prerequisites":"Quantum mechanics (I)(II), Statistical mecahnics in the undergraduate course","texts_and_materials":"Prints are distributed in the class.","assessment":"Task (25%) x 2 + final exam (59%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"superconductivity. electron-phonon interaction, Cooper pairing, Bose condensation","office_hours":"Thursday 12:00~13:00","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/28/2019 9:26:39 AM","name":{"id":1937,"ja":"超伝導工学","en":"Advanced Superconductivity"},"instructor":{"id":651,"ja":"内藤 方夫","en":"NAITO Michio"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"courses for master's programs","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Thu.1","references":"参考書\nキッテル「固体物理学入門」１２章\nキッテル「熱物理学」７章、１０章、１２章\n進んだ専門書\n理論\nM.
