At present, as a standing director of a social welfare corporation, I teach the improvement of communication ability which is indispensable for the interpersonal support job in the corporation. Based on the practical experience described above, two main points are emphasized in this course. First, you should write logically as to be a science specialist, present and discuss orally, and acquire academic presentation skills. You will learn the logical structure and operation of words comprehensively in both Japanese and English. The second point is to gain a deep understanding of the communication that underlies the presentation and to put it into practice. Through the lectures, emphasis will also be placed on the training of each student's ability to use \"speech language\" such as pronunciation, accent, intonation and rhythm, which will lead to deeper mutual understanding and practice of mutual actions.\nWhile I welcome the active participation and practice of the participants, shy students are also welcomed and will be provided careful support.\n","expected_learning":"Students are required to achieve the following three issues through lectures.\n1) Learn logical arguments and composition of sentences in Japanese and English, acquire written comprehension and presentation skills.\n2) Improve English ability necessary to achieve 1).
