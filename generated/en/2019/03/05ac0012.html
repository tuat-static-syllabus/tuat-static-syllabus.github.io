Prof. Kato (Tokyo University) on August 5th and by Dr. Shibuya (Institute of Vegetable and Floriculture Science, NARO) on September 6th. This lecture is the professional subject of the biological-production science course.\n\nThe lecture by Assoc. Prof. Kato:\nThe role of biological production science on the agricultural development, and the agro-biology for the rural development will be discussed in this one-day intensive program. Some of the on-going activities for the improvement of crop productivity and livelihood in rice-based systems in tropical Asia will be introduced, referring to prevailing abiotic stresses and the constraints on production.\n\nThe lecture by Dr. Shibuya:\nVarious issues and latest topics on biological production science will be discussed. The theme of this lecture is flower senescence and postharvest technology.","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n\nThe lecture by Assoc. Prof. Kato:\nTo be able to express ideas and opinions on the agricultural technology and rural development based on biological science, and discuss these with others.\n\nThe lecture by Dr. Shibuya:\nUnderstanding the senescence mechanism and quality retention technology of cut flowers.","course_schedule":"The lecture by Assoc. Prof. Kato:\nSchedule: From 10:00 to 17:00, Monday, August 5\nClassroom: 6-209\nIntroduction | International agricultural research institutes/centers | Rice ecosystems in tropical Asia | Research for development of rice technologies, demonstrations and dissemination\n\nThe lecture by Dr. Shibuya:\nSchedule: From 10:30 to 17:30, Friday, September 6\nClassroom: 6-209\nFlower longevity is one of the most important traits for ornamental plants. Understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of flower senescence is needed to efficiently develop postharvest technology. This course provides an overview of postharvest biology and technology of cut flowers.","prerequisites":"In addition to class hours, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.\n\nThe lecture by Assoc. Prof. Kato:\nThis lecture entails the active participation of students into brainstorming and discussion on agricultural technologies. A less detail-oriented but more action-oriented workshop style will be pursued.","texts_and_materials":"The lecture by Dr. Shibuya:\nHandouts","assessment":"The lecture by Assoc.
