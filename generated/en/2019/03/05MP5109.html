The purpose of this lecture is to understand the formation of natural environment (in particular, landforms, surface geology, soil, vegetation) and the history of human activity as basic knowledge for considering the harmony between food production and environmental conservation.\nSummary: The Quaternary, which is the geological age of about 2.6 million years ago, is a period in which the cold glacial period and the warm interglacial period have been repeated periodically, and such environmental changes have shaped the natural environment seen today, and humanity has changed the nature of the earth in the environmental change. In this lecture, students will learn about the outline of Quaternary environmental change and human activity, and then, using topographic and thematic maps, the landforms, surface geology, soil, and vegetation of the Kanto plain will be explained how it was formed. In the process, students will also proceed to actively carry out reading work of maps.\nThis lecture is special lecture of the Department of Science of Biological Production.\n","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand the Quaternary global environmental changes and human activity, and to learn how to think about the formation history of natural environments (especially landforms, surface geology, soil and vegetation) mainly in the Kanto Plain.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"This lecture will be given by part-time lecturer Hideki Miura (National Institute of Polar Research, Associate Professor).\nSchedule: 10:00 to 17:30 of Wednesday, September 18\nClassroom: 6-209\n1.
