Toshiyuki Fukuhara, Masahiro Natsume and Satoshi Nakamura, give lectures about recent topics of Bioregulation and Biointeraction.\nFukuhara: Versatile functions of RNAs in plants, especially, RNA interference (RNA silencing) and RNA-derected DNA methylation.\nNatsume: Growth and differentiation of microorganisms and interaction between microb-microb and microb-plant are regulated by not only genes or proteins but also low-molecular-weight organic substances. This course provides various examples of discovery, isolation and structure elucidation, biosynthesis and mode of action of such physiologically active substances.\nNakamura: This course provides students with Applied entomology and biological control of insect pests.\n","expected_learning":"To understand RNA interference, bio-active substances and Applied entomology.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\n","course_schedule":"Fukuhara\n1. Regulation of gene expression by small RNAs I: Post-transcriptional gene silencing by miRNAs or siRNAs.\n2. Regulation of gene expression by small RNAs II: Transcriptional gene silencing by small RNA-directed DNA methylation.\n3. Defense against virus infection by RNA silencing.\n4. Application of RNA interference and RNA-directed DNA methylation.\n\nNatsume\n1. How to proceed research in the chemistry of bio-active substances\n2. Differentiation-inducing substance of the microorganism\n3. Antagonism between microorganisms\n4. Aerial mycelium-inducing substance in actinomycete\n5.
