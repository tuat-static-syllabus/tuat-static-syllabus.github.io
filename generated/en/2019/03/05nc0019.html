To understand the effects of changing environment on ecosystems, interdisciplinary research beyond border of research fields is needed. This class is provided by four researchers with different research backgrounds who are carrying out a collaborating project, and deal with basic science of each research field as well as the apply science for environmental issues.","expected_learning":"Understanding the effects of environmental changes due to the disturbance of materials cycles on ecosystems from several viewpoints. Recognizing the relationship between own research field and surrounding fields. Furthermore, understanding the ability in a interdisciplinary research with surrounding fields.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"Omnibus/15 periods total\nDate and time of the lecture will be announced by web bulletin board.\n\nGenki Katata (4 periods)\nThis course for master’s students is an introduction of “interdisciplinary research” over the state-of-art collaborative project.\n\n1. Why \"interdisciplinary research\" ?\n2. Atmospheric and terrestrial environmental science\n3. Group-work\n4. Summary and final report\n\nKeitaro Fukushima (4 periods)\n- Stream water chemistry and discharge rate are a useful indicator for assessing nutrient and water dynamics in a forest watershed. This lecture, based on Forest Hydrology and Forest Ecosystem Ecology, aims to provide a basic knowledge about biogeochemical cycle of nutrients and water in forest. The lecture also covers a response of forest ecosystem to disturbance, such as forest clear-cut, over-load of atmospheric N, and so on; and introduces some case-studies about the biogeochemical linkage of forest and aquatic (riverine and coastal) ecosystems from the point of view of nutrient dynamics.\n\n5. Biogeochemical cycle of nutrients and water in forest\n6. Factors determining stream water chemistry and discharge rate\n7. Forest disturbance and its impact on biogeochemical cycle\n8. The role of forests in river and coastal ecosystems\n\nJun Koarashi (4 periods)\n- A quantitative understanding of carbon cycling processes in terrestrial ecosystems and their responses to changes in the environment is the key to accurately predicting the future of Earth’s climate. This lecture demonstrates how useful radiocarbon is for studying carbon cycling processes in terrestrial ecosystems. The lecture also introduces some topics linking environmental science to the Fukushima nuclear accident.\n\n9. Carbon cycle and global warming\n10. Radiocarbon: origin, analytical methods, and applications to carbon cycle study\n11. Dynamics and diversity of soil organic carbon revealed by radiocarbon analysis\n12. Environmental science in the nuclear research field, focusing on the Fukushima nuclear accident\n\nMakoto Watanabe (3 periods)\n- The lecture introduces the effects of environmental changes in the atmosphere on carbon assimilation through leaf photosynthesis of trees, main component of forest, especially from a viewpoint of plant nitrogen use.\n\n13. Characteristics of nitrogen use in plant\n14. Scale up from a leaf level photosynthesis to a vegetation production.\n15. Effects of atmospheric changes on production of forest ecosystem\n","prerequisites":"This lecture is a specialized subject.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (30 hours).\n","texts_and_materials":"Materials of this lecture will organized in each class according to the need.","assessment":"Performance in lecture (30%) and report assignment given by each instructor (70%)","message_from_instructor":"We hope you learn how the researchers in ongoing interdisciplinary research with different background consider.","course_keywords":"Forest Ecosystem, Material Cycle, Changing Environment, Interdisciplinary Research","office_hours":"You can ask us your question between lectures. If you have questions in the other time, please send an e-mail to Watanabe firstly. The question will forward to the lecturer in charge.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/11/2019 12:43:31 PM","name":{"id":2217,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅴ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅤ"},"instructor":{"id":1680,"ja":"渡辺 誠, 福島 慶太郎, 堅田 元喜, 小嵐 淳","en":"WATANABE Makoto, FUKUSHIMA Keitaro, KATATA Genki, KOARASHI Jun"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":1,"min":1,"max":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"2nd","course_type":"2nd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Allen F.
