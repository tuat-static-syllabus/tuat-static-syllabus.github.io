While confirming the basis of thermodynamics, take up the energy use of sunlight and biomass as its application. We will discuss technical issues concerning natural energy utilization and issues for system construction. 2. Express the process related to biomass production and preparation as a mathematical model and understand its analysis and system control.\nThis subject is offered as a specialized subject in the Department of Agriculture, and is a required compulsory subject for completing the Food and Agriculture Information Engineering Program.","expected_learning":"1-1.
