This course will introduce structure and function of plants macromolecules. Additionally, I also talk about structural variability of cellulose microfibrils and its analytical methods.\nIn each lecture, ‘important points’ are clearly indicated in the PowerPoint and handout. ‘Technical terms’ will be introduced kindly in the lectures. Students are encouraged to study using the ‘important points’ and ‘technical terms’, as well as data and figures provided in the class to build a systematic understanding on biomass structure and function.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand a fundamental biomass structure and function ,　that is morphology, structure, formation and degradation of plants macromolecules. In addition, study the methods for analyzing these mechanism.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n\n\n\n\n","course_schedule":"1.Introduction of biomass science\n2.Hierarchical structure of wood biomass\n3.Woody anatomical and cell structure\n4.Cellulose crystalline structure and its distribution in nature\n5.Cellulose biosynthesis and biodegradation\n6.TEM observation I\n7.TEM observation II\n8.TEM observation III\n9.Chemical structure and its variability for hemicellulose\n10.Accumulation mechanism of hemicellulose\n11.Chemical structure and deposition mechanism of lignin\n12.Infrared spectroscopy I\n13.Infrared spectroscopy II\n14.Biorefinery\n15.Biorefinery","prerequisites":"Students have review and preparation for the class by using handouts and text.\nIt usually takes 3 hours for review and preparation.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts","assessment":"Credit will be given based on the participation / contribution / normal points (50%) and reports (50%).","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Biomass, cell wall, structural variability, microscopy, spectroscopy, multivariate analysis, crystalline structural analysis","office_hours":"Office hours is held in the lunch time.
