Especially, topics such as agricultural science, applied life science, ecology can be included. Students acquire the ability to do a series of processes from planning and designing experiments and monitoring to statistical analysis and interpretation by themselves. Applications of statistical software R will be demonstrated in this class in order to make practical use in their own research.","expected_learning":"Understand the basics of statistics as basic subjects necessary for conducting research in agriculture and related fields, understand the processing of data using interpretive statistical methods, and the interpretation method of results. The following three points are the reaching criteria.\n1. Understand the basics of statistics\n2. Learn methods that can statistically process phenomena related to agriculture and related fields\n3. Evaluation of judgment and validity of contents obtained by analysis result\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1. Orientation session\n2. Learn basic knowledge of statistics\n3. Know the nature of the data\n4. Basic concept of statistical analysis I- statistical test\n1. Orientation session\n2. Learn basic knowledge of statistics\n3. Know the nature of the data\n4. Basic concept of statistical analysis I- statistical test\n5．Basic concept of statistical analysis II- statistical estimation\n6. Concept of experimental design\n7. Interpretation of the analysis result\n8. Concept of statistical modeling\n","prerequisites":"Related to subjects of the thesis, it is a required compulsory subject which is divided into special research A group. Subjects of special study group A open for April enrollment students, enrollees for October should take subjects of special study group B.\n\nIn completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\n","texts_and_materials":"Handout will be arbitrarily provided before each coursework.","assessment":"Submission of assignments after each lesson 30%, report 70%","message_from_instructor":"The goal of this class is generating sample data and analyzing that using appropriate statistical methods.
