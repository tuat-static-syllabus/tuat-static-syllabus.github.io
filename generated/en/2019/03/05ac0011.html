Nutrition is mainly based on “meal”.\nEating is influenced by appetite, eating and eating behavior, and eating something delicious by the person’s will orally with pleasure and a sense of well-being. An appropriate and enjoyable diet encourages growth, promotes and restores health.\nIn this lecture, we will study nutrition management for prevention and treatment of diseases at each life stage, and comment on a healthy diet.\n\nThe lecture by Prof. Miura:\nPurpose: Biological production activities have been conducted using the natural environment. The purpose of this lecture is to understand the formation of natural environment (in particular, landforms, surface geology, soil, vegetation) and the history of human activity as basic knowledge for considering the harmony between food production and environmental conservation.\nSummary: The Quaternary, which is the geological age of about 2.6 million years ago, is a period in which the cold glacial period and the warm interglacial period have been repeated periodically, and such environmental changes have shaped the natural environment seen today, and humanity has changed the nature of the earth in the environmental change. In this lecture, students will learn about the outline of Quaternary environmental change and human activity, and then, using topographic and thematic maps, the landforms, surface geology, soil, and vegetation of the Kanto plain will be explained how it was formed. In the process, students will also proceed to actively carry out reading work of maps.\nThis lecture is special lecture of the Department of Science of Biological Production.","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\nThe lecture by Prof. Kawaguchi:\n1. You can think about your own nutritional assessment and nutritional management goals about how to take diet and nutrition for health management and disease prevention.\n2. The group can propose the production and processing of agricultural and livestock products effective for lifestyle prevention and disease improvement.\n\nThe lecture by Prof. Miura:\nThe standard of this lecture is to understand the Quaternary global environmental changes and human activity, and to learn how to think about the formation history of natural environments (especially landforms, surface geology, soil and vegetation) mainly in the Kanto Plain.","course_schedule":"The lecture by Prof. Kawaguchi:\n1. Understand the basic knowledge of nutrition.\n2. Understand the healthy diet (nutritional intake, diet).\n3. Understand the relationship between health and diet. Especially about eating habits for preventing lifestyle-related diseases.\n4. Conduct group work on the production and processing of agricultural and livestock products that can contribute to people's healthy diet.\n\nThe lecture by Prof. Miura:\nSchedule: 10:00 to 17:30 of Wednesday, September 18\nClassroom: 6-209\n1. The concept of the \"Quaternary period\" including glacial-interglacial cycle\n2. The relationship between Quaternary environmental change and the formation of natural environments\n3. The relationship among Quaternary environmental change and the history of human activity, biological production\n","prerequisites":"In addition to class hours, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"The lecture by Prof. Kawaguchi:\nDo not use texts or textbooks. Distribute PowerPoint documents.\n\nThe lecture by Prof. Miura:\nHandouts are provided in the lecture.","assessment":"The lecture by Prof. Kawaguchi:\n1. You can complete the nutrition evaluation sheet using your own physique index and the food intake situation.\n2. We will propose two to three proposals based on grounds for the production of agricultural and livestock products and products with functionality for healthy eating habits or disease prevention.\n\nThe lecture by Prof. Miura:\nGrade: Work report 15%, Final report 35%","message_from_instructor":"The lecture by Prof. Kawaguchi:\nIn order to live a healthy diet, it is desirable to eat foods and processed foods that make use of abundant natural ingredients. However, under various environmental conditions and physical conditions, functional agricultural and forestry fishery products and processed products are required. We hope that the experts of \"food\" and \"agriculture, forestry and fisheries livestock\" will learn to achieve a healthy and affluent diet.\n\nThe lecture by Prof. Miura:\nI would like to encourage students to consider the significance of agriculture, as the current human activity, for the modification and conservation of the natural environment, by historically and comprehensively understanding the landforms, surface geology, soil and vegetation that are the foundation of biological production.","course_keywords":"The lecture by Prof. Kawaguchi: Nutritional management, lifestyle-related disease prevention, functional food; The lecture by Prof. Miura: Quaternary, glacial-interglacial cycle, historical landform development, soil formation history, natural history, human history, agricultural history, Anthropocene","office_hours":"by e-mail.
