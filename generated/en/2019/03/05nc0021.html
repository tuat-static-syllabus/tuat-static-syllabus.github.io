In this class, four instructors will lecture.","expected_learning":"In this class, the judgement of the achievement will be done whether the fundamental knowledge of the atmospheric environment are derived, application of the derived knowledge on the environmental chemistry are enabled and the plans for the field work or environmental chemical experiments are made by yourself.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"This class is the omnibus style lecture conducted by the instructors.\nThe detail of the class are shown as follows;\n\n\n(1) Shungo Kato: Tokyo Metropolitan Univ.\nThe expositions of the real examples of the field measurements and fundamental of the environmental measurements. Properties, behavior and the method of the measurements of the gaseous trace species will be primary explained. In addition, the expositions how to measure the trace species in urban or remote area, analyze and derive the useful data.\n\n(2)Tomoaki Okuda: Keio Univ.\nIt is important to have your own idea individually and act since it is impossible to think the environmental issues and anthropogenic activity separately. In this class, the training that the environmental issues are thought as the issue for yourself will be done. In first, the lecture how to drive the date for the environmental issues, especially atmospheric environmental, will be done. Next, the group discussion for the various environmental issues will be done. The aim of the class is to have your own opinion for the various environmental issues based on the scientific knowledge throughout the class.\n\n(3) Kei Sat: National Institute for the Environmental Studies (NIES)\nTo understand the general outlines for the experiments or observation for the atmospheric sciences, following lecture will be done in this class; (1) the history of the scientific knowledge and control for the air pollution by the photochemical reaction, (2) experimental instruments and analytical method for the smog chamber, (3) the scientific examples of the clear up of the formation process of the secondary organic aerosol and (4) the scientific examples of the toxicity of the oxidant in the particulate matter.\n\n(4) Shinji Saito:Tokyo Metropolitan Research Institute for Environmental Protection\nIn this class, real practices for the monitoring and control for the improvements of the atmospheric environment, which the local government are doing, will be done.\n\n","prerequisites":"This lecture is an elective subject, and is one of the specialized subjects.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (15 hours).\n","texts_and_materials":"Depend on the instructors.","assessment":"attitude the class(40%) and submission of the reports(60%)","message_from_instructor":"We expect that many active students take this class.","course_keywords":"Atmospheric Environment, Environmental Chemistry","office_hours":"By the demand","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/15/2019 2:31:58 PM","name":{"id":2218,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅶ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅦ"},"instructor":{"id":1681,"ja":"中嶋 吉弘, 佐藤 圭, 加藤 俊吾, 齊藤 伸治, 奥田 知明","en":"NAKASHIMA Yoshihiro, SATO Kei, KATO Shungo, SAITO Shinji, OKUDA Tomoaki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":1,"min":1,"max":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"2nd","course_type":"2nd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Depend on the instructors."}}
