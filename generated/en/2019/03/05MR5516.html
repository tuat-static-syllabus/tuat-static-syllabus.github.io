To begin with, the lecture will be focused on the characteristics of molecular structure, reactivity, solvent and dissolution property, methods for estimating the structure of cellulose derivatives, followed by the recent topics of our laboratories on polymer alloy of cellulose and synthetic polymers, and synthesis and utilization of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural from cellulose, which is regarded as one of the building brick of bio refinery system in the future.","expected_learning":"Basic understanding of the structure, reactivity, physical properties of cellulose and its derivatives. Knowledge of modification and degradation of cellulose, and polymerization method for cellulose blockcopolymers.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/)\n","course_schedule":"1. Characteristics of cellulose structure and its physical property\n2. Solvents, dissolution and its mechanism of cellulose.\n3. Structural parameters influencing solubility of cellulosics and their evaluation methods.\n4. Examples of recent research topics in our laboratory.\na.
