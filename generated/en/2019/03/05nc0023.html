Lecturer:Dr. K.Yasumiba\nEnvironment conservation is essential study for worldwide and urgent activities. We need not only to obtain basic and logical knowledges but also to do some actions practically based on technical and applied researches. The objectives of this lecture is to consider by yourself of what you can do for an environmental problem with international connections.\n\nCourse 2. Lecturer: Dr. O.Yoshikawa\nFirst, students will get the knowledge of environmental conservation especially conservation ecology from basic and applied studies. And especially for invasive species, you will understand the basic research from global and local issues and train to discuss the control management and the action method for solving the problem. Also, we will introduce the differences of research life and academic area between Japan and other countries at the global point of view.\n","expected_learning":"Course 1.\nStudents need to gain ability to discuss solutions for environmental problems by expressing your ideas and listening to others' opinions.\n\nCourse 2.\nI expect you to have interests on various interactions and their ecological implications.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.

I’m happy to give such a chance and the skills you can discuss with various researchers.\n\nCourse2:\nBiological interactions are ubiquitous all around us. I hope this lecture will direct your interest on these phenomena in nature.","course_keywords":"Invasive species, international, seed dispersal, pollination, biological network","office_hours":"Anytime during the class.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/12/2019 11:43:35 AM","name":{"id":2219,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅸ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅨ"},"instructor":{"id":1682,"ja":"岩井 紀子, 吉川 徹朗, 休場 聖美","en":"IWAI Noriko, YOSHIKAWA Tetsuro, YASUMIBA Kiyomi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":1,"min":1,"max":1},"neutral_department":"農学府","category":"","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":""}}
