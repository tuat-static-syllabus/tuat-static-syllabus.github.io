In order to understand recent environmental changes and associated ecosystem changes, and to predict the future, it is necessary to understand the climate change history and the global environmental system. Ecosystems respond to environmental conditions. On the other hand, we need to understand that environment can also be affected by ecosystems. Therefore the interaction between environment and ecosystems is also an important factor for environmental system. In this course, historical changes of past-present-future climate and driving forces in each time scale are reviewed, and it is also explained that the actual situation concerning the effects of global/local-scale environmental stresses on ecosystems and the relationship between the causes and the socio-economic structure.","expected_learning":"By the end of this class, students will be able to: (1) understand past-present history and future of climate change, its driving forces and an overview of the global environmental system, (2) acquire important points of modeling for ecosystem phenomena and mechanisms, and (3) understand ecosystem dynamics under various environmental conditions and environment-ecosystem interactions.","course_schedule":"Class 1.
