There are a lot of unique cultivation techniques in Japan. One of the most characteristic techniques is using plant growth regulators. In this lecture, we learn about the basic physiological effect and the control mechanism of plant growth regulators. We read in turn about the technical books to develop the knowledges about the practical use of plant growth regulators on horticultural crop production. We practice how to use the plant growth regulators in actual.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand a basic physiology of plant growth regulators and actual usage in horticultural crop production.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\nURL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1: What is plant growth regulator?\n2: The actual usage of plant growth regulators in horticultural crop production.\n3-12: We read in turn about the technical books.\n13-14: We practice how to use the plant growth regulators in actual.\n15: Total discussion\n","prerequisites":"This is part of the Courses of Plant Production Science, and its completion is recommended for students in the Department of Science of Biological Production.
