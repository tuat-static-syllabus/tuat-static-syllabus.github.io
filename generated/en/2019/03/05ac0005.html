The metabolic disease, such as ascites and fat liver, has been accompanied by fat deposition. According to these aspects, I have studied the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism in chickens for the production of high quality meat with less fat, i.e. (1) Effective manipulation of fatness chickens, (2) Characterization of cholesterol metabolism in chickens, (3) Development of chicken oocyte ?the production of designer eggs-, and (4) Identification of regulatory molecule in chicken species-specific glucose metabolism.\nThis lecture introduces our previous studies on nutrition in farm animals and will discuss the further studies for animal productions.\n","expected_learning":"Resent animal nutrition will be understood in lecture.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"１．Molecular nutrition\n２．Animal welfare\n３．Cytoskeleton\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided in class.","assessment":"Based on report.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/28/2019 2:03:25 PM","name":{"id":2136,"ja":"動物生産科学Ⅰ","en":"Animal Production Science Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":1613,"ja":"佐藤 幹, 新井 克彦, 新村 毅","en":"SATO Kan, ARAI Katsuhiko, SHIMMURA Tsuyoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":1,"min":1,"max":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Wed.1","references":"To be announced in the lectures."}}
