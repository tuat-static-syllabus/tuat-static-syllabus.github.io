With respect to these biological, physical and chemical factors that harm plants, we clarify the various properties, related factors, mutual relationships with plants, etc. so as to safely and reliably control plant diseases It is expected to connect. In this lecture, three members of the Biological Control Sciences Division, Ariyoshi, Inoue and Kasahara, studied physiological and ecological studies on environmental stress such as phytopathogenic microorganisms, pests / nematodes, weeds, high temperature and salt, , Evolution, molecular biology, recent trends in genomic chemical analysis research, purpose of research, how to design a research plan based on experiment results, relatively new technologies available for research, mechanisms and advantages of failure control technology ・ Shows specific research cases and global research trends about disadvantages, etc.","expected_learning":"I am interested in what kind of work is being done in the research of the leading edge of biological control science, understand the following and be able to discuss.\n(1) Understanding of advanced research such as physiology, ecology, evolution, molecular biology, genome science\n(2) Understanding the purpose of the research, recent trends, how to set up research plans\n\nIn addition to the lesson time of 30 hours and the above-mentioned lesson learning time, using the text to be distributed in the lesson, materials to be posted on HP and moodle, prepare and review according to the standard number of the university\n\nAs a viewpoint of the diploma policy, please refer to the following curriculum map of HPU (Three Policies).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"From the viewpoints of physiology, ecology, evolution, molecular biology, genome science, biological interaction etc. from the viewpoint of research at the leading edge of biological control science, research purpose, recent trend, research plan We introduce research cases and global research trends on how to set up, relatively new technologies, mechanisms of disease control technology, advantages and disadvantages, and so on.\n(* Ari, ** Kasahara, *** Inoue)\nPart 1: Plant protection and biological control in food production *\nThe second: General explanation of plant diseases, insect damage / nematode damage, weed damage, environmental stress such as high temperature and salt (1) **\nThe third: General explanation of plant diseases, insect damage / nematode damage, weed damage, environmental stress such as high temperature and salt (2) ***\nThe fourth: Ecology of phytopathogenic microorganisms *\nFifth: Evolution and differentiation of plant pathogens *\nSixth: Plant pathogen and plant interaction *\nThe seventh: Disability and environmental stress (1) **\nEighth: Disability and environmental stress (2) **\nThe 9th: Plant environmental stress tolerance **\nThe 10th: Ecology of plant sphere insects, nematodes, etc. ***\nEleventh: Mechanism of disorders mediated by insects, nematodes, etc. ***\nThe 12th: Co-evolution with plants such as insects and nematodes ***\nThe thirteenth: Biological control ***\nThe 14th: Control of plant pathogens *\nThe 15th: Environmental control in plant protection **\n","prerequisites":"It conforms to standard time number of our university\nBefore studying this lecture, it is desirable to review the relationships such as \"plant pathology\", \"plant physiology\", \"biological control\" and so on.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"valuate in the report.
