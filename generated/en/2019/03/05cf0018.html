She obtained Ph.D. of physical geography in Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany. She has been working on improving monitoring technique for bedload sediment in mountain revers. She also focuses on patterns of sediment movement for changes in river morphology.\n\nCourse description\nThe lecture by Dr. Bunte includes introduction of sediment movement in streams and rivers. She will explain processes and mechanisms how, where and when sediment can be mobilized. She also explores how we can evaluate the sediment movement in a given condition around the world. Discussion in the lecture will be extended toward river and watershed management and conservation.\n\nDr. Julien Tournebize\nDr. Julien Tournebize is Research Engineer and the team leader of Attenuation, Mitigation, Transfer and Modelling of Pollutant in HydroSystems Section in Irstea, France. He has received Doctor degree in Physics at University of Strasbourg in 2001. After, He worked as Research Engineer in Cemagref which is former institution of Irestea. He has been mainly worked for the aria of pollutant fate and transport and mitigation in aquatic ecosystem.\n\nCourse description:\nThe lecture content by Dr. Tournebize includes regarding general water quality issue in agricultural drainage and wetland ecosystem. Other issues are the water quality mitigation using buffer zone in terms of nitrate and pesticides. Functions and roles of vegetative buffer zone for reducing pollutant concentration entering streams and aquatic ecosystem will be presented.\n\n\nDr. Liyantono\nDr. Liyantono is an associate professor in Bogor Agricultural University. He obtained Ph.D. in United Graduate School of Agriculture Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan. He focused modeling and remote sensing approaches for rice field and water resources management. He specified for using soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model for water and soil conservation from paddy to watershed scales. His focuses extends to economical evaluation and environmental conservation.\n\nCourse description\nThe lecture included general aspects of watershed hydrology, field and remote sensing approaches, and managements. His lectures will also include modeling and prediction of land use changes in watershed scales.
