We explore various　themes that demonstrate　the unique value of each culture,　and examine cultural differences and similarities from a variety of　perspectives. At the same time, the students are provided with opportunities to reconsider their own cultures. Active participation in　class discussions, through the sharing of different experiences and　points of view, is expected to stimulate students’ cultural awareness.","expected_learning":"Your active participation in discussions is expected.","course_schedule":"1.
