Development research from discovery to registration of new pesticides involves different fields such as \"chemistry\" related to the creation of new compounds, \"biology\" responsible for various biological evaluation tests, and \"toxicology\" to evaluate the safety of compounds. The researcher of this group works closely with each other to promote research, and this leads to the creation of a new drug. In this lecture, we will focus on lead compound creation research, which is an early stage of the creation of new agricultural chemicals.In particular, we will create random synthetic lead compounds, create mimic synthetic lead compounds, and develop lead compounds using a biorational approach. The creation of a lead compound using computer chemistry and the like will be explained with examples of the synthesis of specific compounds and photos of biological evaluation tests (greenhouse test, field test, etc.).","expected_learning":"1.
