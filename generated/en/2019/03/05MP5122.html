To conduct the sustainable soil management, it is necessary to understand the nutrient dynamic of soil, in relation to soil physico-chemical characteristics, climate condition, and local farmer’s knowledge. Student will learn the various soil ecosystem function, related to above things, from semi-arid to humid region, and from temperate to tropical regions.","expected_learning":"Students who successfully complete this course will be able to\n1. Explain the soil function with reference to its genesis and composition in various agroecosystems,\n2. Discuss the nutrient dynamics of agroecosystems including the climate and soil characteristics, and discuss the sustainable soil management.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"For each unit, 1 to 4 class will be held.\n\n1.Guidance,and basic soil science\n2.Guidance,and basic soil science\n3.Guidance,and basic soil science\n4.Nutrient dynamics and crop production in semi-arid region\n5.Nutrient dynamics and crop production in semi-arid region\n6.Nutrient dynamics and crop production in semi-arid region\n7.Nutrient dynamics and crop production in humid region\n8.Nutrient dynamics and crop production in humid region\n9.Nutrient dynamics and crop production in humid region\n10.Nutrient dynamics and crop production in lowland\n11.Nutrient dynamics and crop production in lowland\n12.Nutrient dynamics and crop production in lowland\n13.For sustainable agriculture\n14.For sustainable agriculture\n15.For sustainable agriculture\n\nDuring each Unit, student must read at least 1 review paper (totally >5 papers), and then make the presentation about the papers.","prerequisites":"Student must get the \"Soil Science\" and \"Material cycles of Soil and Fertilizer Science\" class at an undergraduate level.\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Class participation/Contribution/Presentation (50%) and report (50%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Soil ecosystems, nutrient dynamics, sustainable agriculture, crop production, soil conservation","office_hours":"By Mail.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/28/2020 5:48:11 PM","name":{"id":1066,"ja":"土壌環境学特論","en":"Advanced Soil Environmental Science"},"instructor":{"id":808,"ja":"杉原 創","en":"SUGIHARA Sou"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"2-222","day_period":"Thu.1","references":"William Dubbin「Soils」（The Natural History Museum），Ray R Weil, Nyle C Brady 「The Nature and Properties of Soils 15ht edition」(Pearson)"}}
