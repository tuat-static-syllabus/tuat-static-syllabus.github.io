Several major findings have recently been reported with regard to biogeochemical N cycle, which serves for re-cycling of N source to biosphere. Purposes of this class are; i) for introducing these novel findings and how they have revised the concept of N cycle, and ii) for illustrating my own research works and their developments on microbiology and analytical chemistry in N cycle.\n\nI would give a talk on 1) how recent major findings have revised the general ideas on biogeochemical N cycle, 2) our developments and improvements on 15N tracer techniques on determining microbial activities on nitrification, denitrification, anammox and DNRA, and their applications, and 3) insights and foresights on relevance of ecology and microbiology on research sciences on N cycles, through my experiences on isolation of oligotrophic nitrifiers.\n\n\n<NAGANO Hirohiko>\nThe purpose of this lecture is to provide students with the knowledge needed to understand the latest outcomes of environmental microbiology in the field of environmental science on biosphere. The lecture also provides students with the knowledge needed to develop solutions for research on environmental science on biosphere.\n\nThis lecture introduces the latest knowledge from research and application of microbial organisms which are variously functioning in the carbon and nutrient cycling on the biosphere. The main topic introduced in this lecture is microbial organisms associating with carbon & nitrogen cycling and greenhouse gaseous dynamics in the terrestrial ecosystems.","expected_learning":"<SUWA Yuichi>\n- Leaning novel findings on N cycle, and comprehending how they revised the general ideas on biogeochemical N cycle.\n- Learning fundamentals on isotope tracer technique, and our developed techniques on measuring a series of microbial activities on N cycle.\n- By learning typical examples, comprehending how useful those techniques are.\n- Making attempts on obtaining insights and foresights on relevance of ecology and microbiology on research sciences on N cycles.\n\n<NAGANO Hirohiko>\n- Understanding the latest knowledge of microbiology in the carbon and nitrogen cycling.\n- Understanding the latest knowledge of microbiology in the greenhouse gaseous dynamics.\n- Understanding the latest knowledge from research and application on environmental microbiology, and acquiring skills in the development of research.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"Omnibus/15 periods total\n\n<SUWA Yuichi> (7.5 periods)\n1. Microbial reactions responsible for biogeochemical N cycle. Fundamentals on isotope tracer techniques.\n2. On our developed tracer techniques for measuring a series of activities on N cycle.\n3. Examples on measurements on activities on N cycle using our developed techniques.\n4. Recent major findings on N cycle, and how they revised the general ideas on biogeochemical N cycle.\n5.

Conclusions and discussion.\n\n<NAGANO Hirohiko> (7.5 periods)\n-Most of soil microorganisms use carbon and nitrogen in soil organic matters. Carbon and nitrogen used by microorganisms are eventually released to the environment as greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and inorganic nitrogen compounds such as nitric acid and ammonia. In this lecture, the relationship between microbes and carbon and nitrogen cycles and greenhouse gas dynamics in various terrestrial ecosystems from high to middle latitudes in the northern hemisphere will be taken with the latest research and findings.\n\n1. Introduction (0.5 period)\n2-4. Microbes and carbon, nitrogen, and greenhouse gasses in boreal forest ecosystems\n5-7.
