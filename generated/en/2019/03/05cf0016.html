We will cover advanced research topics with high social demand in the priority areas of research. In particular, world's top-level foreign researchers will give basic and updated knowledge and skills of science and practical application. We will have both lectures and exercises of research with the mission of “Solving the problems”. In FY2019, we will focus on soil, which is the foundation of the agriculture and forestry field, and learn from GIR invited professors, Prof. Lee MacDonald, and Prof. Gary Stacey who are guest lecturers on the basics of soil infiltration, its application, and measurement methods in the field.","expected_learning":"Lecture by Prof. Lee MacDonald\nThe objectives of this course are to: 1) provide the students with an understanding of the key processes that control infiltration; 2) learn and use a relatively simple procedure to measure infiltration in the field; 3) analyze and compare the data to understand the variability and uncertainty in infiltration measurements; and 4) use the lessons learned to better understand model uncertainties.\nInfiltration is arguably the most critical single process in hydrology and land management. If the infiltration rate is high then rainfall and snowmelt will infiltrate into the soil, resulting in little or no surface runoff or surface erosion, low peak flows, more water available for plants, and highwater quality. On the other hand, if the infiltration rate is lower than the rate of rainfall or snowmelt inputs, the excess water will run across the land surface, resulting in a much greater potential for soil erosion, higher peak flows, less water available for plants, and poorer water quality.\nInfiltration is a surprisingly complex process that varies tremendously over time and space. Infiltration rates are essential for predicting nearly every part of the hydrologic cycle as well as erosion and plant growth. The problem is that infiltration is very difficult to predict from soil texture, plant cover, topography, or other readily available variables. Hence direct measurements of infiltration often are crucial for model calibration. Gaining experience with measuring infiltration is important to help understand this key process, the spatial variations in infiltration over small distances, the extent to which the methods for measuring infiltration affect the resulting value, and understanding the extent to which we can or cannot accurately model key hydrologic processes and crop water status.\n\nLecture by Prof. Gary Stacey\nThe objectives of this course are to provide the students with basic knowledges for interaction between plants and soil microorganisms at molecular levels and to discuss with students about the mechanisms and applications in agricultural science.\n\n講師の略歴\nDr. Lee MacDonald, professor emeritus at Colorado State University, will be the instructor. He taught hydrologic processes, watershed measurements, and a variety of other undergraduate and graduate courses in the Watershed Science Program for more than 20 years. He has worked or travelled to more than 70 countries, and has extensive field experience with hydrology and natural resources research and management in southeast Asia, Japan, North America, Europe, Antarctica, and to a lesser extent in Africa and Latin America. See https://www.nrel.colostate.edu/investigator/lee-macdonald-homepage/ for his publications.\nDr. Gary Stacey, distinguished professor at University of Missouri, will be the instructor. He has been working on plant and microbe development for more than 40 years. A major focus of research in his lab is the symbiosis between legume plants and rhizobium to establish nodule on the root of the host where rhizobium fixes atmospheric nitrogen, which the plant can use. His laboratory is also contributing to the development of soybean genomic researches.
