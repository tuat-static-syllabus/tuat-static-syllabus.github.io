Participants examine the case studies on sustainable use of organic resources responding to the environmental conditions of different regional ecosystems.","expected_learning":"1. To understand the various indicators of sustainability in biological resource utilization. In particular, the participants are able to consider nutrient cycling broadly from the macro viewpoint to the micro view point.\n2. To understand the issues of the utilization of biological resources in Japan and developing countries and the necessity of an interdisciplinary approach to solve them.","course_schedule":"Part I. Introductory lectures (by Oikawa)\n1. Guidance, several frameworks for sustainable utilization of biological resources\n2. Nutrient cycling and related issues in agroecosystems: nitrogen and phosphorous\n3. Biodiversity and seed conservation\n4. Biological resource utilization in forests and conservation areas\n5. Application of agroforestry\nPart II. (by Oikawa)\n6. Multipurpose uses of biochar\n7. Bokashi organic fertilizer using biochar\n8. Case study of evaluation of biochar properties\n9. Germination test to evaluate Bokashi organic fertilizer\n10. Challenges for sustainable utilization of organic resources\nPart III. (by Okazaki)\n11 to 15, Rhizobium, endophyte, and mycorrhiza: effective biofertilizers?","prerequisites":"Participants need to prepare and review the classes to respond to our standard time of 30 hours course.
