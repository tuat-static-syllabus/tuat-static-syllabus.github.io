Our group discovered the female sex determinant factor in 2014. Surprisingly, this factor was piRNA which is a one of a small RNA molecule. Furthermore, piRNA was targeted to the male gene Masc transcribed from the Z chromosome. In this lecture, we will introduce recent findings on the sex determination mechanism of Lepidoptera insects revealed by Bombyx mori and the sexual manipulation mechanism related to it by Volvacia.\n","expected_learning":"To obtain the knowledge of insect physiology and biochemistry, and how to apply this knowledge to industrial goods.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )","course_schedule":"1. Diversity and similarity in insect sex-determination system\n2. History of sex determination research in silkworms\n3. Finally found! piRNA determines sex of silkworm\n4.
