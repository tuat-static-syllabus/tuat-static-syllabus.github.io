We will learn the structure and function of cells, the mechanism of energy production in cells, and the transfer and utilization of genetic information from nucleic acids, especially DNA, to biomolecules. We will then learn how such scientific phenomena and the knowledge are applied in industrial and biomedical technologies that support our traditional, modern and future lives.　This lecture course includes interactive classes, discussion sessions and opportunities for presentation.","expected_learning":"1. To gain a fundamental understanding of ‘life’ at the cellular and molecular levels and to apply such knowledge in learning biotechnology and modern molecular techniques.\n2. To understand updated interdisciplinary biological topics relating to chemistry, physics, medicine and veterinary medicine in English, and to be able to describe a topic of own interest in English\n\nCompetency development:\nCommunication skills, Presentation skills, Knowledge on science and technology\n","course_schedule":"1　Carbohydrates, Lipids, and Chemical Energy That Sustains Life\n2　Proteins, Enzymes and Their Applications in Industry\n3　Anaerobic Respiration, Fermentation and Their Applications (Food and Bioethanol Production)\n4　Aerobic Respiration and ATP Synthase.
