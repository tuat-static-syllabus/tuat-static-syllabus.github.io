Due to population explosion and rapid development of industries in the late 20th century, the necessity of water/wastewater treatment is growing day by day. Throughout this course, students will learn how wastewater treatment plant works and how important biological reactions are to treat wastewaters.","expected_learning":"The objective of this course is for students to learn:\n1. The major biochemical & physiochemical processes related to contemporary water and wastewater treatment\n2. Functions of these processes\n3. Applications and limitations of these operations\n4. Basics of microorganisms: phylogeny, physiology and kinetics\n\nA student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\n1. Understand the history and significance of water and wastewater treatment.\n2. Discuss water quality by taking a look at the constituents and the way to treat these contaminants.\n3. Understand diversified microorganisms with different physiological functions and criteria for them to play a major role for contaminant removal.\n4. Understand the biokinetics and equations of microbial growth and decay under different environmental conditions. nt.\n5. Understand criteria for biological removal of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous from wastewater.\n\n","course_schedule":"Week 1: General introduction: course objectives, history, and basic strategy of wastewater treatment\nWeek 2: Wastewater constituents\nWeek 3: Physical Unit operations: Screening, mixing, separation\nWeek 4: Physical Unit operation: Gas transfer and separation\nWeek 5: Basics of environmental microbiology and microbial ecology\nWeek 6: Biological unit operation 1: Introduction of microbial ecology, physiology, kinetics, and stoichiometry\n-The first report will be provided.\nWeek 7: Mass balance in Asian plantation (1)\nWeek 8: Mass balance in Asian plantation (2)\nWeek 9: Biological unit operation 3: Activated sludge/nutrient removal systems\n\nPotential schedule change may be notified during the course.\n","prerequisites":"None","texts_and_materials":"Not specifically.","assessment":"Scores on a mid-term and final assignments.
