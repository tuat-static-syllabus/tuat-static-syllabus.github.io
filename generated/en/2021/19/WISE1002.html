More specifically, an overview is provided of nutrients contained in foods, and students develop an understanding of basic concepts of nutrition and their significance, and learn basic facts about processes like metabolism of nutrients. In addition, students learn about the connection between food function and illness, problems relating to food safety, and the importance of the food environment, and thereby develop an understanding of important issues pertaining to food and health.","expected_learning":"Standard of achievement\nDevelop an understanding of the nutritional characteristics and physiological function of foods based on chemistry and biology. Develop an understanding of the types of nutrients, their roles in the body, their metabolism and interactions, and be capable of giving an overview explanation. Learn how foods sustain health and are connected with illness, and deepen understanding regarding the onset of lifestyle-related illness, and prevention of illness through dietary habits. Use of these sources of knowledge to maintain and improve health, and prevent illness.\n","course_schedule":"1st-2nd session) Food Safety (Food Poisoning, Food Additive, Food Labeling)\n3rd-4th session) Science of Taste (Roll of Nutrients in our body)\n5th-6th session) Visits to food production, distribution and consumption sites (farmers, school cafeteria, nurseries, etc.)\n7th-8th session) Report and discussion of the site visit\n","prerequisites":"It is preferable to have some fundamental knowledge of biology","texts_and_materials":"日本食品成分表2019年 七訂、医歯薬出版㈱\nPrintouts handed out when appropriate","assessment":"Attendance, Attitude in the lecture, reports","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Health, nutrients, food safety, diseases, lifestyle-related disease","office_hours":"Students will be notified at first lecture","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/14/2021 2:31:24 PM","name":{"id":2303,"ja":"生活科学概論","en":"Outline of Life Science"},"instructor":{"id":2417,"ja":"吉野 知子, 小林 真里","en":"YOSHINO Tomoko, KOBAYASHI Mari"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"卓越大学院プログラム","category":"","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":""}}
