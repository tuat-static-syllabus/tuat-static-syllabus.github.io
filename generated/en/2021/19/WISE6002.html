In this course, students experience research presentations at overseas academic meetings and research conferences, participation in presentations/discussion at international conferences, and short-term study abroad or internship at an overseas organization (e.g., university, research institution, company). The aim is to improve English skills and acquire the ability to discuss issues in English from a global perspective.\n[Overview] Students participate in international conferences and academic meetings held overseas, and engage in presentations and discussions in English. There is a short-term study abroad in overseas organizations. In preparation for full-fledged medium/long-term study abroad, the experience of short-term study abroad or internship serves as a valuable opportunity to not only gain presentation experience in English but also to master skills for discussion from a global perspective. Students improve their English skills and acquire the ability to make presentations and engage in discussions from a global perspective.\n\nStudents are allowed to apply for credits (transferring) to this course based on their own activities. When students took the equivalent courses in their or other departments, or when students conducted activities equivalent to this course, in terms of contents, hours, and desired goals and competencies, they may apply for credit transferring to this course.
