The Python programming language is used to carry out practical exercises relating to processing, analysis, and visualization of the data which forms the foundation of data science. In addition, students learn and develop an understanding of basic methods of machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks).","expected_learning":"- Learn the fundamentals of python.\n- Ability to process and analyze data using Python, NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas.\n- Ability to visualize data using matplotlib.\n- Ability to practically implement basic machine learning methods using scikit-learn.\n\n","course_schedule":"1st session) Orientation, setup of programming exercise environment\n2nd session) Fundamentals of Python (variables, data types, control structures)\n3rd session) Fundamentals of NumPy (arrays, matrix operations)\n4th session) Fundamentals of Pandas (DataFrame construction, data visualization)\n5th session) Data visualization (matplotlib)\n6th session) Supervised learning using scikit-learn (support vector machines)\n7th session) Fundamentals of deep learning\n8th session) Conclusion\n\n","prerequisites":"Must take “Outline of Data Science” course before or in the same semester.
