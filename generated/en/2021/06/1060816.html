As for medical device, compared with diagnostic device, such as diagnostic imaging unit, therapeutic instruments are inferior to those of Europe and the United States. As for state-of-the-art analytical devices, the percentage of imports goods are high in market. As for iPS cells, the number of patent applications have been overtaken by the United States, and the difference in the number of presented papers are significant. In this course, you will understand the characteristics of the Japanese bioindustry, in comparison with a Japanese area of specialties, such as electronics industry or semiconductor industry.\nRegarding the use of intellectual property, you will learn how to analyze the R&D strategy of others, and the basic techniques for building your strategy. You will understand how to access not only to patent information, but also to enterprise information and political policy, and other related information such as market trend. You will understand that by combining these various types of information, you can obtain an accurate overall image.\nAbout bio ventures, whose strategy for intellectual property is very important, you will understand the method for analyzing strategy of each company, and work on a practical exercise using the analyzing method. As an example of world-class technology, we will examine iPS cells and genetic treatment and learn about status of technology development and intellectual property strategy on each topic.","expected_learning":"Understanding how to access to various types of information, necessary for analyzing intellectual and R&D strategies of others. And analyze intellectual properties of bio ventures specifically by using the skill obtained.\nUnderstand how to clarify the subject of your research and analysis, by grasping the concept of technological overhead view, then creating a technological overhead view that will contribute to your own research and expertise for business and to assemble necessary information and analysis axis.\n\n<Definition>\nTechnological overhead view: Technological scope of fundamental studies (or business) that comprise it, related technology surrounding it, the spread of the application industry research and the evolution of the field of application technology and technology necessary in order to evolve their applications, in order to clarify the position of your research (or business), all in one diagram. It is used as basis of R & D strategies, intellectual property strategy and strategic management.","course_schedule":"1st: Guidance; Purpose, overview, situation of life science relating industry(markets, policy, patent application trends, Science and Technology Basic Plan, etc.) situation purpose, an overview of the life science industry.\n\n2nd: Management in the Innovation development (Goldratt Japan)\n\n3rd: Intellectual management; Effect and limitation of intellectual management\n\n4th: Intellectual management 2\n\n5th: Medical service system and regulation; The current situation and challenges in regenerative medicine realization\n\n6th: Advanced technology and Intellectual property in fish farming\n\n7th: Search for patent information; How to create search query and Case study of patentability decision and Methods of patent analysis(1)\n\n8th: Search for patent information; How to create search query and Case study of patentability decision and Methods of patent analysis(2)\n\n9th: Intellectual property strategy analysis of biotech; (2)Presentation of assignment (Presentation 1)\n\n10th: Case study of advanced Life industry; Venture Capital in USA (MPM Capital)\n\n11th: Use of patent information; (1)Patent map and technological overhead view\n\n12th: Case study of advanced Life industry; National Project Management (NEDO)\n\n13th: Case study of advanced Life industry; Fish (Kindai University)\n\n14th: Research tool patents and representative cases of patent disputes\n\n15th: Use of patent information; (3)Presentation of assignment (Presentation 2, creation of technological overhead view)\n\n16th: Intellectual Property Management (Former Managing Director of Japan Intellectual Property Association)\n\n\n","prerequisites":"It orders to take advantage of the web information, such as patent search using the patent electronic library (IPDL), an environment that can connect to the web is desirable. Regarding Report 3, it is desirable to have some sort of technical specialty (need not be a life field).","texts_and_materials":"Prepare PowerPoint documents and put it up on moodle beforehand.","assessment":"The grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, report, and online tests. Standard study time set by the our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows: Normal score: 20%, report, assignment test and online test: 80%. Grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.\n\nReports will be evaluated by total points, according to the criteria which is announced beforehand. Comprehensive evaluation of performance is determined by the 5-point method based on the performance of the Report 2 and 3.\nEvaluation will be done only to those who have handed in all of Reports.","message_from_instructor":"Essences of this course will be a useful for not only for Intellectual Property Personnel, but also for R & D Personnel. By understanding about surveillance, and analyzing and evaluating research tasks will lead you to efficient management of R & D.\nFind your original perspective of the analysis in extracting the information.","course_keywords":"Biotechnology; Life Science; Bio Venture; Patent Map; Technological Overhead View","office_hours":"Saturday from 11 to 18.","remarks_1":"Two Reports and opening a presentation during a lecture each three times is be absolutely imperative. Submission is essential in all two times.\n1) Analysis of intellectual property strategy of bio-venture in association with the seventh Lecture.\n2) Devised axis of analysis and creation of technnological overhead view in association with the twelfth Lecture.\nIn addition, impression of lecture given by a guest lecturer must be submitted as a report.","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"8/7/2021 5:41:58 PM","name":{"id":1285,"ja":"生命産業知財戦略論","en":"Intellectual Property in Bioindustry"},"instructor":{"id":879,"ja":"宗林 孝明","en":"SORIN Takaaki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering","category":"The Professional Degree Program of Industrial Technology and Innovation","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Fri.7","references":"Reports and documents of Japan Patent Office."}}
