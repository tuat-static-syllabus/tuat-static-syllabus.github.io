The glycochain has been elucidated in recent years as its third chain next to proteins and nucleic acids, and the functions have been clarified in various stages such as development, differentiation, proliferation, and canceration. This lecture provides outline of the physiological functions of glycochains, including the role in glycoproteins that have recently been used as \"drugs\".\n1）Concepts of glycobiology\n2）What is sugar\n3）Structual basis of glycan diversity\n4) Cellular organization of glycosylation\n5) Biological roles of glycans\n6) N-Glycan\n7) O-Glycan\n8) Glycolipids\n9) Glycans in biology\n10) Glycans in glycoprotein quality control\n11) Bacterial and viral infections\n12) Genetic disorders of glycan degradation\n13) Genetic disorders of glycosylation\n14) Glycosylation change in cancer\n15) Glycans in biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry","prerequisites":"Students need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Report assignment or examination．","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"glycobiology、glycoprotein、carbohydrate、disease","office_hours":"Questions are accepted at the end of the lecture．","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/11/2021 8:02:03 PM","name":{"id":2578,"ja":"生命科学特論Ⅱ","en":"Life science special lectureⅡ"},"instructor":{"id":18,"ja":"西河 淳","en":"NISHIKAWA Atsushi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering(Doctor)","category":"courses for the doctral program","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Essentials of glycobiology　（Cold spring harbor laboratory press）"}}
