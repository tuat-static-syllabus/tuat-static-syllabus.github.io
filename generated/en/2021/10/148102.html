The course will be divided into two parts. In the first part of the course, students will study about the characteristic features of high-quality international conference presentations in terms of intended audience, purpose, organization, flow, style, and delivery. Students will also learn to how to adopt effective presentation skills, visualization techniques, and language patterns to present their specialist work in a powerful and effective way. At the end of the first part of the course, students will prepare a short 4-min presentation describing the background to their research. In the second part of the course, students will plan and deliver a longer 10-min research presentation describing their current work following a typical conference presentation format. As part of the presentation planning process, students will learn how to paraphrase, cite, and reference previous work,explain simple and extended concepts in their field, describe their methods and processes, introduce, explain, and hedge interpretations of data in figures and tables, and summarize their research.\n\n\n\nThe course will be delivered in an ON-DEMAND format through video lectures and accompanying slides and activities. The materials for each day will be released one week prior to that scheduled day of the course. All homework assignments will need to be completed by one week after that day of the course. The final presentation will need to be completed and recorded by one week after Day 3 of the course. An *optional* face-to-face Zoom session will be organized on each day of the course for discussion of the materials and assignments.\n","expected_learning":"1. understand the importance of presentations and their inherent problems\n2. control nerves and deliver a presentation with confidence and authority\n3. design clear and attractive visual aids\n4. identify the audience, purpose, organization, flow, style, and delivery of presentations\n5. deliver a presentation from notes with comprehensible pronunciation\n6. use natural-sounding linking phrases and expressions when navigating and explaining presentation content\n7. understand how to deal with questions from the audience\n8. learn how to cite and reference presentation resources and data","course_schedule":"Day 1 (December 4, 2021 - Saturday)\nSession 1: Introduction and Basic Principles of Presenting in Science and Engineering:The importance of presentations; Controlling nerves in front of an audience\nSession 2: Audience, Purpose, Organization, Flow, Style, Delivery\n[Self-learning activities: watching authentic scientific and engineering presentations; evaluating a presentation in a specialized field; ]\nSession 3: Effective Strategies for Delivering Clear and Powerful Presentations:\nSession 4: Effective use of hardware and software; Slide design; Useful expressions for explaining and linking slides\nSession 5: Preparing a short 4-slide presentation on your research background\n[Self-learning activities: explaining and recording a presentation; analyzing strengths and weaknesses]\n\nDay 2 (December 11, 2021 - Saturday)\nSession 1-2: The language of presentations (part 1):\nExplaining the title, outline, introduction, and conclusion\n[Self-learning activities: designing and practicing the main sections of a research presentation]\nSession 3-4: The language of presentations (part 2):\nExplaining the methods and results\nSession 5: Designing the final presentation (oral vs poster presentations)\n[Self-learning activities: designing and practicing the methods and results sections of a research presentation]\n\nDay 3 (December 18, 2021 - Saturday)\nSession 1: The language of presentations (part 3):\nHandling the Q&A of a presentation\n[Self-learning activities: watching Q&A sessions, practicing answering impossible questions]\nSession 2: Introduction to poster presentation design and delivery techniques\n[Self-learning activities: designing a poster, explaining the main points, responding to questions and comments]\nSession 3: Feedback on drafts of the final (poster) presentations\nSession 4-5: Final video presentations\n[Self-learning activities: analyzing final presentations, looking for improvements]","prerequisites":"In preparation for the course, you will need to prepare some research content (i.e., background references, methods descriptions, figures/tables of results, etc.) that you can develop into slides (e.g., PowerPoint or Keynote slides) during the three days of the course. At the end of the three-day course, you will be expected to present this content in the form of a 10-min video presentation. One option for the content is to bring the materials you used to prepare the final paper for the summer intensive course in technical writing that many of you attended. However, you may also bring more recent content if you want. Please note that during the course, there will be no time to *create content*. Rather, we will be taking your already completed content and redesigning it into bullet points, simplified figures/tables, and summary slides.\n\nA basic tutorial on the use of presentation software (Microsoft PowerPoint) will be given, although prior knowledge of such software is desired.","texts_and_materials":"Course materials will be made freely available on WasedaMoodle.","assessment":"Students are expected to view all video lecture materials, and actively communicate with the teacher through MessageMyTeacher and the online forums.
