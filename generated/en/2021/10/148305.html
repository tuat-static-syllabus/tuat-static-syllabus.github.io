The course will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that induce regeneration, and explain latest findings regarding the significance, separation, preservation and propagation inducing method of stem cells, which are of great importance to regnerative medicine. To illustrate peripheral technology supporting regenerative medicine, the forefront in the development of various research equipment and materials will be introduced, and the contributions that can be made by science, engineering, and biomedicine to regenerative medicine will be discussed. Further, problems will be taken up and considered about the possible impacts of progress of regenerative medicine on human society.","expected_learning":"Understanding of mechanism of regeneration.\nUnderstanding of advantages of and problems with regenerative medicine.\nUnderstanding of the ethical aspect of regenerative medicine.\n","course_schedule":"1st: What is regeneration?\n2nd: Molecular mechanism of regeneration I\n3rd: Molecular mechanism of regeneration II\n4th: Overview of stem cells\n5th: Types of and identifying method for stem cells\n6th: Isolation and culture methods for stem cells\n7th: Stem cell propagation method and underlying technological development\n8th: Peripheral technologies of regenerative medicine\n9th: Clinical application of regenerative medicine　(1), Non-permanent lecturer\n10th: Clinical application of regenerative medicine　(2), Non-permanent lecturer\n11th: Fusion with anti-cancer therapy, Non-permanent lecturer\n12th: Forefront of cancer therapy and regneration), Non-permanent lecturer\n13th: Social impacts of regenerative medicine\n14th: General discussion\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 15 times of the lectures, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Evaluated according to reports and presentations","message_from_instructor":"While interpretatively reading research papers, students are expected to know latest information on regenerative medicine, and search for opportunities to make technical contributions to regenerative medicine　from other fields of specialization.","course_keywords":"Regenerative medicine, stem cells","office_hours":"2:00-5:00 p.m. on workdays (make an appointment in advance by e-mail)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/12/2021 1:14:41 PM","name":{"id":1511,"ja":"分子再生医学特論","en":"Advanced Molecular Regenerative Medicine"},"instructor":{"id":901,"ja":"田中 あかね","en":"TANAKA Akane"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"生物システム応用科学府博士後期","category":"後期専門科目","department":"生物システム応用科学府博士","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":""}}
