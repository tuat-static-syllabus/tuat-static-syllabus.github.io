Specifically, we aim to understand the following contents.\n1. Understanding the characteristics and reactivity of major elements and the stability of compounds in relation to the periodic table.\nUnderstanding of the roles and functions of metal complexes in biological systems.","expected_learning":"1. Understand the properties of elements based on the periodic table and explain them systematically.\n2. Understand and explain acid-base reactions and redox reactions in aqueous solutions.\n3. Understand and explain the relationship between chemical bonds and structures in metal complexes, and the characteristic properties of complexes.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: A\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"1. Lecture guidance. What you will learn in inorganic chemistry\n2. Atomic structure and the periodic table\n3. Chemical bonding and crystal structure\n4.
