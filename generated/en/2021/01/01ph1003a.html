Guidance and how to writing report (Groups A and B)\n\n2. Motion of trolley and gravitational acceleration (Group A)\n3. Motion of trolley and gravitational acceleration (Group B)\nLearn about gravity, the basis of physical phenomena.\nRecord the movement of the bogie that moves on the slope and caluculate the gravitational acceleration.\n\n4. Basics of Measurement and Handling of Measured Values (Group A)\n5. Basics of Measurement and Handling of Measured Values (Group B)\nLearn about caliper and balance handling and measurement errors.\n\n6. Measurement of Young's Modulus of Metallic Materials by Bending Loading Method (Group A)\n7. Measurement of Young's modulus of metallic materials by bending loading method (Group B)\nLearn about elasticity, the basis of material mechanics. The bending Young's modulus of the metal bar is determined by the loading method.\n\n8. Joule heat measurement and heat work equivalent (Group A)\n9. Joule heat measurement and heat work equivalent (Group B)\nLearn the relationship between current and voltage, resistance and heat energy, which are the basis of electricity. The work equivalent of heat is measured from the electric-energy relationship (Joule's law).\n\n10. Wavelength measurement of laser beam by diffraction (Group A)\n11. Wavelength measurement of laser beam by diffraction (Group B)\nMeasure the wavelength of the wave (light) using a steel rule or diffraction grating.\n\n12. Explanation of experiments and reports (1) Basics of measurement and handling of measured values (Groups A and B)\n13 Explanation of experiment and report (2) Motion of trolley and gravitational acceleration and Joule heat measurement and heat work equivalent (Groups A and B)\n14.
