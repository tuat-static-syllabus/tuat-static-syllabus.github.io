Students will acquire knowledge on intracellular, ontogenetic and population-based study by using microorganisms, plants and animals. They also learn how to illustrate organisms by hand, how to observe organisms by microscpoe, and how to treat raw data for the subsequent analyses.","expected_learning":"To understand and to learn how to observe microorganisms, plants and animals.\nPlease also refer to ouf curriculum summary from our web (in Japanese).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"This course will consist of following part.\n1. Introduction: Students will learn what they should prepare for the experiments.\n2. Observation of plant cells: Students will learn how to use a microscope and how to illustrate what they see by sketching.\n3.Observation of chromosome of plants: Prepare chromosome sample by flattening out the meristem cells derived from plant root, and by smearing method for the salivary glands of chironomid, and compare visible characteristics of plants and animal chromosome.\n4. Dissection of mice: Students will learn an anatomical struscture of animals.\n5. Observation of microorganisms in a pond: Students learn what kinds of microorganisms are found in aquatic ecosystems.\n6. Observation of external structure of arthropods: Studies on insects, especially bees, in both macroscopic and microscopic manners with sketching.\n7 and 8. Experiments on human genomes: Students extract their own genomic DNAs and analyse genetic polymorphisms of alcohol dehydrogenase.\n","prerequisites":"Students should register \"Fundamental experiment on Chemistry\" as well. Students should peform preperation and review of the experiment in home, using a textbook and handouts using the standard amount of time as specified by the university for each class.","texts_and_materials":"Text will be provided in class.
