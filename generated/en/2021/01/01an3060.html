Thus, understanding of olfactory reception mechanisms of insects and utilizing them make it possible to develop olfactory-based insect control technologies as well as high performance biosensors for odors. In this lecture, olfactory reception mechanisms of insects, with a focus on moth species, and applied researches based on insect olfactory systems will be presented.\nThis subject is positioned as Frontier subject of in Department of Biological Production.\n","expected_learning":"Students are expected to learn the mechanisms underlying “odor” and “pheromone” reception in insects and will be able to discuss about the methods to control insect behavior and the biosensor technology based on their reception mechanism.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"Prof. Takeshi Sakurai, Tokyo university of Agriculture will give you the following lectures.\n1) Olfactory communication in insects\n2) Molecular and neural mechanism of olfactory reception in insects\n3) Technology to control insect behaviors based on olfactory reception mechanisms\n4) Biosensor technology based on insect olfactory reception mechanisms\n","prerequisites":"It is desirable the student learned basic Biology.\nStudents take the lecture, and are also recommend to prepare for and revise the lectures by using references and handouts, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\n","texts_and_materials":"The text will be introduced in lectures.","assessment":"We evaluate by attitude to the class (50%), and assignment (50%).","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Odor, Pheromone, Olfaction, Olfactory receptor, Biosensor","office_hours":"Please get an appointment with your instructor by e-mail (katsuito@cc.tuat.ac.jp).","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/29/2021 12:00:48 PM","name":{"id":2458,"ja":"生物生産学特別講義Ⅰ(動物系)","en":"Special Lecture on Biological Production Ⅰ(Animal)"},"instructor":{"id":2179,"ja":"伊藤 克彦, 櫻井 健志","en":"ITO Katsuhiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":14,"min":3},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Some additional readings will be introduced in lectures.\n"}}
