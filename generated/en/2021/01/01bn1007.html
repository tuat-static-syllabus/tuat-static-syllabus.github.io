To that end, not only safety for the human body but also control and management technologies that do not impair the diversity of ecosystems and biodiversity must be established and applied. In this lecture, we will outline the basic concept of plant protection and administration, control and management techniques of plant pathogenic microorganisms, pests, weeds, etc., pesticides and biocontrol agents used there, and new technologies.\nThis lecture is a class by teachers with practical experience. Dr. Takagi has the practical experience of the Food Safety Commission, etc., Arie has the academic experience committee for the application of the first-class use regulations for genetically modified organisms, etc. To educate people about the importance of plant protection and the importance of science communication in society.","expected_learning":"Understand the basic concept and administration of plant protection, control and management techniques for plant pathogenic microorganisms, pests, weeds, etc., drugs and microorganisms used there, as well as new technologies.\nPreparing for and reviewing in accordance with the standard hours of the university, using 30 hours of lesson time and the above-mentioned extra-learning time, as well as textbooks distributed in class and materials posted on HP and moodle.\n\nAs a viewpoint of the diploma policy, please refer to the following curriculum map of HPU (Three Policies).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"Class plan:\nThe lecture will be conducted by ten faculty members and a part-time lecturer (Dr. Kazuhiro Takagi) .\nPartial intensive courses.\n\nOutline of each class (2020 course status.
