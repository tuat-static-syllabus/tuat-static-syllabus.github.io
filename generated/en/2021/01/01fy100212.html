In the 21st century, securing food resources has become an extremely important issue along with issues related to environmental pollution and energy resources. For that purpose, it is very important to make efforts to create new food forms as well as to develop effective production methods for agricultural products, effective storage methods for food resources, processing methods, and development of unused resources. Under this trend, dream foods such as various new forms of foods and functional foods are being created. However, on the other hand, problems that threaten food safety such as food poisoning and mad cow disease have also emerged, and efforts to produce safer foods are becoming more necessary than ever, and from a long-term perspective. Safety research is becoming more and more important. In this seminar, we will take up the problems surrounding modern foods and think about what kind of foods should be produced in order to achieve sustainable development of humankind and lead a prosperous life. I want to make it a place where I can deepen.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"改訂　21世紀に何を食べるか　恒星出版\n参考書は教材として用い、貸し出し致します。","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"When you have any questions, visit my office (2-424) after having an appoitment by e-mail.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/8/2021 4:20:19 PM","name":{"id":298,"ja":"農学基礎ゼミ","en":"Basic Seminar of Agricultural Science"},"instructor":{"id":151,"ja":"服部 誠","en":"HATTORI Makoto"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"Liberal Arts and Fundamental Studies","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Thu.2","references":""}}
