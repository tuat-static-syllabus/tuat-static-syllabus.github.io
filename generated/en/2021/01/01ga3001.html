The lectures also include examples of how basic studies are fundamental to and applied to the cutting-edge research, and of the research environment in the globalized society. Through such experience, students are encouraged to consider the values of their studies and research in a broad context and towards their own future. This course will aid students to elevate their global awareness and improve their English communication skills in practice.\n\nThis lecture course is included in Global Integrated Studies of the Liberal Arts and Fundamental Studies, and offers students opportunities to apply and integrate their knowledge and skills obtained in the foundation courses during their first two years in the university.\n","expected_learning":"1.

We study the genetics of plant stress tolerance mechanisms to identify stress tolerance determinants, as well as to understand how plants grow and develop.\n\n\n\" Embracing imperfection and independency\" by Prof Koiwa\n\nWhat makes transitions from \"a student\" to \"an independent scientist\"? Topics included are mindsets, preparation, society, and career perspectives.\n\n\n\"Deciphering brain mechanisms to understand cardiovascular diseases and develop new treatments\" by Dr Gouraund\n\nHigh blood pressure, an extremely common disorder,？？is a risk factor for deadly cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, depending on the patients, available treatments are not always effective in treating this disorder. Hypertension develops from a combination of genetic predisposition and civilized life-style which is still not well understood. Our supposition is that primary hypertension involves activation of the sympathetic nervous system through a pivotal region in the brain: the Nucleus Tractus Solitarii (NTS). This presentation describes the strategies and techniques we used so far to search for causative genes of neurogenic hypertension within the NTS of an animal model of human essential hypertension.","prerequisites":"In addition to 16 hours in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"・Class participation (30%)： Contribution to the discussion and lectures throughout\n・Written report (50%)：　For each GIR session, a report is assessed, which should include summary and important points of the lectures and discussion, as well as own thoughts and ideas about international research environment and career paths\n・Contribution to the common sessions and worksheets（20%）\n\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"International research development, Career paths","office_hours":"For the international GIR researchers, questions should be asked during the class time.
