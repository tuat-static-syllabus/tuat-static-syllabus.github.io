To understand recent environmental changes and associated ecosystem changes, and to predict the future, it is necessary to understand the climate change history and the global environmental system. Ecosystems respond to environmental conditions. On the other hand, we need to understand that environment can also be affected by ecosystems. Therefore the interaction between the environment and ecosystems is also an important factor for the environmental system. In this course, historical changes of past-present-future climate and driving forces in each time scale are reviewed, and it is also explained that the actual situation concerning the effects of global/local-scale environmental stresses on ecosystems and the relationship between the causes and the socio-economic structure.","expected_learning":"By the end of this class, students will be able to: (1) understand past-present history and future of climate change, its driving forces, and an overview of the global environmental system, (2) acquire important points of modeling for ecosystem phenomena and mechanisms, and (3) understand ecosystem dynamics under various environmental conditions and environment-ecosystem interactions.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"The contents are as follows.\nClass 1. Global climate change and its driving forces\nClass 2. Global carbon cycle\nClass 3. Basics of mathematical ecology and ecosystem modeling\nClass 4. Environmental features and issues of coral reef ecosystem\n\nThe lecture will be conducted in the following schedule.\n〇月△日（●）の×－×限\n（Schedule undecided: Posted by the end of September）\n\n\n\n","prerequisites":"The contents lectured in the classes such as “Ecosystem Management”, “Marine Environmental Studies”, “Environmental Pollution Chemistry”, “Environmental Toxicology”, “Geochemistry”, “Earth Science”, \"Geo-Environmental Studies\", and “Earth Environment Geology” will help you to understand the contents in this class.\n\nIn addition to 8 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"No specific texts.
