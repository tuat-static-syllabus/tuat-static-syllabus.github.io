The environment in each of earth subsystems such as atmosphere, pedosphere (geosphere) and hydrosphere are lectured, including their formation, functions and histories. Students learn basic topics of agricultural and environmental sciences from the views of chemistry and physics and agriculture.\n\nThis course, \"Environmental Geoscience\", give lectures on current environment of each of earth subsystems including geochemical cycles, while the other course \"Geoscience\" addresses broad spatial scales such as inner earth and the universe in broad time scales such as the evolution of the universe and the earth.","expected_learning":"Students who successfully completed the course of this lecture will be able to explain and consider the followings in the earth subsystems giving concrete examples together with abstract and comprehensive concepts.\n1) components\n2) structure\n3) function\n4) history\n5) future\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma

convenience.\nPlease listen carefully to the announcement during class.\n","prerequisites":"Students who take “Geoscience”, “Geoscience Experiments”, “Organic/Inorganic chemistry”, “Physics”, and “Geography” etc. will be advantageous for understanding the contents of this class.\n\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.\n","texts_and_materials":"Teachers prepare for a print (or a document on web system), if necessary.","assessment":"Judged from the results of examination.\nQuestions are designed to assess the understanding of and the ability to explain the topics dealt in the lectures.\n","message_from_instructor":"Students are hopefully required to understand that the material-energy circulation in each earth subsystem\nis caused by the characteristic relationship and movement between the sun and the earth in the universe, and the circulation is consequently closely related to our life.\n","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Please visit
