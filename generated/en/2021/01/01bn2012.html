The lecture also provides students with the latest knowledge in these fields.\n\nThis lecture introduces the basic and latest knowledge of homeostasis mechanisms in mammals from the aspects of endocrine, immune and nervous system. The students will be expected to understand the ingenious mechanisms for homeostatic systems in animals through this lecture.\n","expected_learning":"- Understanding the homeostasis in animals, mainly mammals.\n- Understanding the endocrine system in animals.\n- Understanding the immune system in animals.\n- Understanding the nervous system in animals.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"This lecture is consisted from total 15 periods.\n\n1. Introduction\n2. Outlines of endocrine system\n3. Mechanism of peptide hormones 1 (G-protein coupled receptor)\n4. Mechanism of peptide hormones 2 (Tyrosine kinase receptor)\n5. Mechanism of steroid hormones\n6. Hormones and diseases\n7. Outline of immune system\n8. Regulatory mechanism of immune system 1 (immune cells, cytokines)\n9. Regulatory mechanism of immune system 2 (humoral and cellular immune systems)\n10. Immune systems and diseases\n11. Outlines of nervous system\n12. Neural signaling system\n13. Sensory nervous system\n14. Autonomic nervous system\n15. Memory and learning\n\nFinal examination is necessary to get the credit.\n","prerequisites":"This lecture is an elective subject, and is one of the specialized subjects.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (30 hours).\n","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided.","assessment":"Performance in lecture (10%) and final examination (90%)","message_from_instructor":"We hope that this lecture will help you on your study in the future by understanding ingenious and elaborate systems of life.","course_keywords":"Endocrine system, hormone, immune system, cytokine, nervous system, neuronal cells","office_hours":"Questions can be asked after class, or please request an appointment by email.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"2/6/2021 9:25:30 PM","name":{"id":2326,"ja":"動物生理学","en":"Animal Physiology"},"instructor":{"id":2183,"ja":"三浦 豊, 渡辺 信博","en":"MIURA Yutaka, WATANABE Nobuhiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"Building 1, Room 208","day_period":"Thu.3","references":"Essential Cell Biology, Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology, Standard Textbook: Physiology etc."}}
