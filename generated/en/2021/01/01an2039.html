Previously, the main agent of farm management is a family-managed farm; however, in recent years farm management agents have become diversified with increases in the number of agricultural production firms or of community-based farming organizations. Moreover, a farm manager has increasing opportunities to work with non-agricultural enterprises in the wake of promotion of rokuji-sangyoka --agricultural business diversification and integration related to manufacturing and commercial sectors― or collaboration of agricultural, commercial and manufacturing sectors.\nWith these recent trends in mind, we discuss basic characteristics of farm management invariant regardless of farm management types as well as differences in producer management objective and behavior by types.","expected_learning":"Students are expected to learn basic issues regarding farm management and　explain them.
