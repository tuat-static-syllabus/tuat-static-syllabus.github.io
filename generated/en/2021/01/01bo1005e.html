Guidance on 13rd April\n#1. Morphology of Mammals (Kaneko Y. & Suzuki K.) April 27, May 11\nPurpose: Examine general skeletal differences among mammalian species, learn how to do sex and age identification, and growth.\nContents: Observe wild boar skulls of a regional population, and identify those age by measuring mandible bone length. Based on the measured data, discuss about growth and sexual dimorphism.\n\n#2. Morphology of Vascular Plants (Choi D.) May 18, 25\nPurpose: Understand ants’ strategy against predators.\nContents: Collect multiple species of ants and compare the amount of formic acid.\n\n#3. Animal Body (Watanabe G.) June 1, 6\nPurpose: Using frogs as a model, students will learn the fundamental structure of animals.\nContents: Students will observe body structure of the frog, and make a perfusion model of the frog heart. They will observe heart beats and conduct an experiment to test effects of temperature and some chemicals.\n\n#4. Ecology of Plants (Yoshikawa M.) June 15, 22\nPurpose:\nContents:\n\n#5. Ecology of Insects (Koike S.)\nPurpose: Understanding the relationship between insect fauna and environment characteristics.\nContents: Collect carabid beetles by pot fall traps.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/3/2021 3:46:06 PM","name":{"id":207,"ja":"生物学実験","en":"Fundamental Experiment on Biology"},"instructor":{"id":800,"ja":"小池 伸介","en":"KOIKE Shinsuke"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"農学部","category":"","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"グローバルイノベーション研究院","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"火3～5","references":""}}
