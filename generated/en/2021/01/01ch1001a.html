In this lecture, you will understand the basics of chemical thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and photochemistry.\n\n[Summary] In the lecture, I will explain the important points in each item. In addition, the \"terms\" that should be acquired as knowledge are organized and presented. The slides used during the lecture will be uploaded to the Google classroom and distributed, I hope that you will use them not only during the lecture but also for review to learn the basics of physical chemistry.","expected_learning":"The goal is to understand the basics of chemical thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and photochemistry.
