Students will experience different styles of lectures and classes depending on the contents. It consists of two parts.\n\nPart I : Common Introductory Program\nIn this program that is common to all first-year students, students will learn about our university and think how they would pursue their academic life here. The university history and TUAT principals are described as well as our research activities, with the aim of encouraging students to engage in university study and to understanding the importance of designing their individual university life.\n\nPart II : Faculty-Specific Program\nThe purpose of the Part II is to experience the three tasks necessary for academic and social life: reading, researching, and speaking, based on your own interests and concerns. I think that you have entered university with a variety of interests and concerns. The task of this class is to talk about these interests in a slightly \"sophisticated\" way and try to attract the interest of your fellow listeners trying to draw out as many interests as possible from them. There are some students who do not know how to look for books or papers, or who have never moderated a discussion before, until they later join a laboratory. In this class, as an introduction, we will read together an introductory book about what \"thinking\" means and how to think (limited to thinking in the humanities and social sciences), and then you will collect books and articles based on your own interests, summarize them, and present them.. The theme can be anything. How to find books and articles will be lectured in the class. The book we will read in class first will be the second chapter of 『あなたの話はなぜ「通じない」のか』(山田ズーニー、ちくま文庫、2006年). Although I am a teacher (and a humanities teacher), I have always been rather uncomfortable speaking in public, so please feel free to join us.","expected_learning":"1) To understand the autonomous learning in the University, and be able to design individual's academic life at University from broad perspectives.\n2) To experience reading, researching and speaking about your interests and concerns, which are necessary for academic and social life, and be able to have an opportunity to become aware of the necessity of these techniques.\n\nCompetency Development：\nInitiative and Autonomy, Leadership and Facilitation, Knowledge Creation, Presentation Skills, Mission-Oriented Research and Problem Solving, Academic Ethics","course_schedule":"Part I : Common Introductory Program\n1.
