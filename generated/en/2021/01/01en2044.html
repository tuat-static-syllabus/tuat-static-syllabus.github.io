Although ecosystem is very complex system, many interesting and important knowledge have been obtained as a result of great efforts by forerunners. We hope you will deeply consider “our” ecosystems and learn the basis for the conservation of them through our lecture. Two staffs will lecture in this subject. Please contact us by e-mail in each.","course_keywords":"Ecosystem, material cycle, biodiversity, conservation of ecosystems","office_hours":"After second lecture on Tuesday.
