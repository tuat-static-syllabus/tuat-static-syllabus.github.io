For working towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the UN in 2015, it is also essential to pursue science, technology and innovation (STI for SDGs).\n\nIn this lecture course, students learn about research activities under the theme of ‘From Microorganisms to Agricultural Production’, in which agricultural sciences and engineering technologies are applied in the yet-to-be-explored fields of study, in order to develop new technologies or new forms of society through interdisciplinary research. Students then engage in group work with fellow students from different disciplines to propose a way in which how they would integrate their expertise in pursuing SDGs.\n\nThis course aims to encourage students to recognize the significance of interdisciplinary research, the diversity of research development, and generation of novel findings. In addition, students are encouraged to think what sort of skills are required in tackling such problems and conducting interdisciplinary research, and find motivation for their studies and research activities in the third and fourth years.\n\nThis lecture course is included in Global Integrated Studies of the Liberal Arts and Fundamental Studies, and offers students opportunities to apply and integrate their knowledge and skills obtained in the foundation courses during their first two years in the university.\n","expected_learning":"1. Students are expected to learn the importance of interdisciplinary research and to be able to describe specifically what techniques and knowledge from different disciplines are integrated.\n2. Through the activity to make a research proposal with students from different faculties, students are expected to become able to explain specific contributions from different disciplines and the novel effect produced by the integration.\n\nCompetency development:\nLeadership and coordination, Innovative thinking, Communication, Mission-oriented research and problem solving\n","course_schedule":"1: Introductory class to describe what interdisciplinary research is, how important it is in creation of new values, and what skills are required in pursuing interdisciplinary research.\n2: Research seminar on use of microorganisms in purifying soils and ground water, given by Prof Masafumi Yohda, from the Faculty of Engineering.\n3: Research seminar on sustainable approaches for pest control and employment of beneficial insects, given by Prof Takeshi Suzuki, from the Faculty of Agriculture.\n4: Research seminar on prospects and limitations of data-driven agriculture, given by Prof Sakae Shibusawa, from the WISE programme.\n5: Learning outcomes are discussed in groups.\n6: Brainstorming to generate ideas on interdisciplinary research which may be useful in tacking SDGs.\n7: Groupwork to prepare own proposals for interdisciplinary research which may be useful in tacking SDGs.\n8: Presentations.\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 16 hours in the class and the activities required to make preparations for group presentations, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"?
