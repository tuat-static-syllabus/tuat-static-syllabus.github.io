On the other hand, in order to reduce CO2 emissions and reduce environmental impact, conventional technologies are at a turning point. In addition to learning the basics of conventional technologies, students will learn about future electrification, the prospects of a hydrogen society, and related technologies.\nThis subject is a specialized subject in the Department of Regional Ecosystems and is a recommended subject for completing the Agricultural Environmental Engineering Program. The teacher in charge has experience in research and development on agricultural machinery and agricultural work technology at research institutes in the country, and in class focuses on knowledge essential to technology development to cultivate the basics of understanding the essence of technology.","expected_learning":"Credited Auditors explain the mechanism and function of the internal combustion engine.\nCredited Auditors explain the characteristics of tractors\nCredited Auditors propose a future vision of a power source in agricultural production to realize sustainable production.\n\nFor perspectives on the Diploma Policy, please refer to the curriculum map of our university HP (3 policies).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1. Tractor Features and Features\n2. Evaluation of Agricultural Work by Tractor\n3. Understanding of agricultural work based on tractors\n4. Various Motor 1 (Internal Combustion Engine)\n5.
