In order to respond to this problem with the power of technology, we will understand the current technology related to agricultural production and consider the future development of technology development.\nThis subject is a specialized subject in the Department of Regional Ecosystems and is a recommended subject for completing the Agricultural Environmental Engineering Program. The teacher in charge has experience in research and development on agricultural machinery and agricultural work technology at research institutes in the country, and in class focuses on knowledge essential to technology development to cultivate the basics of understanding the essence of technology.","expected_learning":"Credited Auditors Explain the current situation of “M” in agricultural technology.\nCredited Auditors Propose a future image of agricultural technology.\n\nFor perspectives on the Diploma Policy, please refer to the curriculum map of our university HP (3 policies).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1. Outline of agricultural technology “BCM”\n2. Is there a choice not to plow? (Tillage technology and soil handling)\n3. What happens if you don't use chemical fertilizer? (Fertilization and material circulation)\n4. Establishment and integrated mechanization system using Japan's unique technology (seeding and transplantation)\n5. Environmental conservation agriculture and sustainable production technology (management and chemical application)\n6. Rural landscape changed by mechanization (harvest / preparation)\n7. Development of new agricultural technology “I”\n8. Test / General Discussion","prerequisites":"According to the standard hours of TUAT, 45 hours of study is a standard course for one credit course, in this course. Assuming that one piece (90 minutes) is learning for two hours, eight classes are converted as learning for 16 hours. About 30 hours of preparation and review are required to meet standard study time.","texts_and_materials":"Slides will be used for a class.","assessment":"Examination: 80%, others (work to class, problem to carry out during class): 20%\nIt is evaluated that it is possible to explain the current state of agricultural technology and to discuss the future image.","message_from_instructor":"In everyday life, be aware that sustainable production can be achieved only by understanding the relationship between ecosystems and local communities, not just agriculture and food supply as production activities.","course_keywords":"Technology, Agricultural machinery, IT, Sustainable production","office_hours":"Questions immediately after class and during class is recomended.
