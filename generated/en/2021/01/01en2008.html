The relation between the character of chemical bond and the structure of molecule including the bond is also discussed.\nThirdly, intermolecular interaction, which causes the association of molecules to materials and affects their structures and properties, is discussed briefly.","expected_learning":"(1) Quantum chemical understanding of (i) structures of atoms, (ii) electronic structures of atoms, and (iii) the principles with which properties of atoms are determined by their electronic structure.\n(2) Quantum chemical understanding of (i) the principle of the formation of chemical bonds, (ii) varieties of chemical bonds, and (iii) the relation between the character of chemical bond and the structure of molecule including the bond.\n(3) Understanding of intermolecular interaction which works in liquid and solid materials and determines their properties.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"Assuming that students have studied the relevant section of the textbook in advance, I will lecture mainly important points and/or points hard to understand in the textbook with the related matters.

To tell the truth, however, the structures and properties of atoms, molecules, and materials are governed by only a few fundamental principles. If you understand the principles and become accustom to seeing the world of materials according to the principles, you need to remember not many matters relating materials any more, and you will find how systematic and beautiful the world of material is.","course_keywords":"Structure of atom, chemical bonds, structure of molecules, structure of materials, quantum chemistry","office_hours":"Tuesday 12:30-14:30.　Please make appointment through e-mail prior to meet for the questions and discussions.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/4/2021 11:15:47 AM","name":{"id":2330,"ja":"化学結合論","en":"Theory of Chemical Bonding"},"instructor":{"id":199,"ja":"高栁 正夫","en":"TAKAYANAGI Masao"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"United Graduate School Agricultural Science","office":"UGSAS-202","day_period":"Tue.2","references":"阿武聡信 他「現代物理化学」培?館\n中?宗隆「化学結合論」裳華房\n中?宗隆「化学－基本の考え?13章 第2版」東京化学同?\n中?宗隆「量?化学－基本の考え?16章」東京化学同?"}}
