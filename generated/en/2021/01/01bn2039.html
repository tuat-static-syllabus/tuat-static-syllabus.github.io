Each part consists of 4-5 days of training course to study principle of science, and then to go from the principle to the practical science.","expected_learning":"Students should be able to obtain basic knowledge and technique throughout the course.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"In the part of general chemistry, students will learn gravimetric analysis by quantitatively determine the net weight of crystalline water in copper sulfate. Students will also learn acid-base titration and redox titrimetry by measuring the content of acetic acid in vinegar and content of copper sulfate in unknown sample, respectively. The ultimate goal is to prepare students to acquire the knowledge on gravimetric analysis, principle of volumetric analysis, and learn/master how to use the lab ware.\nIn the part of basic organic chemistry, students will learn basic organic synthesis reaction as well as distillation, evaporation and thin-layer chromatography and ion-changing chromatography via the synthesis of acetanilide. In the part of biochemistry, students will get a knowledge on enzyme kinetics via enzymatic reaction using alkaline phosphatase.\n\n","prerequisites":"In addition to the lectures in the class, you are recommended to prepare and review the class using the standard amount of time as specified by the university for each class.","texts_and_materials":"Text will be provided in class.
