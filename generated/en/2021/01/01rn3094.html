And, this course provide as much as possible the time to practice in the forest and nursery.\nSummary :\nThe students are staying at the Field Museum (FM) in Gunma prefecture of TUAT for practical works as follows : The silvicultural methods, such as planting, pruning and thinning, and the survey methods of forest soil, stream water.\nMoreover, in the nursery of Fuchu campus, as well as training development and management of seedlings, sexual and asexual reproduction of seedlings, to practice tree transplanting, and research method of tree physiology.\nThe practice of this course has the firsthand experiences on forestry administration and natural resources managements in local government etc. In this course, students will be trained in the silviculture techniques for forestry and natural resources manager.\n","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"Attention! The field trip information will be shown the Google Classroom in the first lecture.\nPractical works in the forest (FM Ooyasan and Kusaki)\n1) tinning, 2) planting, 3) pruning, 4) elite tree selection,\n5) natural regeneration technology, 6) the method of 7) viewpoint of forest ecology\n\nPractical works in the nursery (Fuchu campus)\n1) guidance of practice of silviculture and compendium of silviculture, 2) Management and breeding method of seedlings, 3) germination characteristics of the seed (seed germination experiment), 4) seed harvest and storage method 5) nursery transplanting of seedling and raising seedling method of healthy seedlings, 6) management of seed orchard, 7) cutting, 8) grafting, 9) layering, 10) nursery soil nutrient management, 11) control of pests and diseases in the nursery, 12) management of light environment, 13) Manufacturing process of the organic fertilizer, 14) the weeding method, 15) the use of forest resource and silviculture plan\n\nAccording to the weather, training is in random order and, in the case of rough weather, combines training indoor and a lecture.\nIn the practical works of FM, the data arrange method is learned and a report is submitted for every group every day.\nIn the practical works of nursery also imposes the report for every group for every settlement of training.\nIt is in random order and is not necessarily 1 time in a title.\n","prerequisites":"In late May, intensive practice was held at FM Oyama and FM Kusaki for 5 days.
