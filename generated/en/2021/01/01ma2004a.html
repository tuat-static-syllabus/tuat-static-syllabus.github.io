In this course, we will learn about differentiation and integration of multivariable functions, such as partial differentiations, criteria of local maxima and minima, double and triple integrations, volumes of solids, line integrations and series. Various computations will be practiced with drawing diagrams","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiation and integration of two, or multivariable functions, and\n(2) to be capable of performing practical computations.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps","course_schedule":"1. Limits and continuity of functions of two variables\n2. Partial differentiation and total differentiation\n3. Partial differentiation of composite functions\n4. Partial differentiation of higher order\n5. Taylor's theorem for functions of two variables\n6. Local maxima and minima of functions of two variables\n7. Implicit functions: Local maxima and minima under bounded conditions\n8. Exercises, or midterm examination\n9. Double integration\n10. Iterated integrations\n11. Changes of variables\n12. Triple integrations\n13. Improper integrations\n14. Volumes of solids and areas of surfaces\n15. Exercise and term examination\n","prerequisites":"Knowledge of the course of Calculus I and Exercise will be used in the lecture.\nIn addition to 60 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for\nand revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and\nusing the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below","texts_and_materials":"to be introduced at the first lecture.","assessment":"Midterm exam 50%, Term exam 50%.\nIn case of online lecture, see below.\nThe grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, report, and online tests. Standard study time set by the our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows: test (schriftliche Prufung) 100%. Grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Multivariable functions, Partial differentiations, Local maxima and minima of functions of two variables, Multiple integrations, Volumes of solids and areas of surfaces","office_hours":"in Fuchu, before/after the lecture","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/22/2021 1:24:15 PM","name":{"id":2333,"ja":"微分積分学Ⅱ","en":"CalculusⅡ"},"instructor":{"id":301,"ja":"原 伸生","en":"HARA Nobuo"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Mon.2","references":""}}
