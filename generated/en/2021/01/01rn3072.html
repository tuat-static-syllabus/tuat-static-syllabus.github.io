Specifically, even when we seek scientific and technological solutions to environmental crises, ethical questions such as why we use the science and technology are inherent in the background. Therefore, the environmental crisis can be understood as an ethical problem. In this lecture, I will give an overview of environmental ethics, which considers what attitude we should take toward nature, based on the environmental crisis as a local or global social reality in which modern agriculture is placed. Based on the history of pollution and global environmental problems, the lecture will introduce examples of environmental crises in the field, and present the findings of past thinkers as a history of thought on environmental ethics. At the same time, the lecture will provide an opportunity for students to think about what kind of environmental ethics is required to deal with today's environmental crisis.","expected_learning":"The student will be able to acquire analytical skills in the humanities and social sciences to address contemporary issues related to agriculture and rural areas that confront humanity in the region consisting of forests, rural areas, and cities, as well as globally.\nStudents will be able to understand humanities and social science research with a focus on environmental ethics.","course_schedule":"1.
