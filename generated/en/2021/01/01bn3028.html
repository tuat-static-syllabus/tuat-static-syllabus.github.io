The topics covered are both principles of plant transfoemation and cell fusion methods and their applications. Students will learn to recognize the statistics of genetically modified foods in Japan and the world, stress tolerance, pytoremediation, and flower color alternation.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n\n・Recognize breeding methods of transgenic plants and cell fusants\n・Recognize down- and up-regulations of plant genes and gene disruption methods\n・Recognize genome editing methods and application of virus vectors\n・Recognize principles and mechanisms of genetically modified foods and phytoremediation\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1. Statistics of genetically modified foods, comparison to non-genetically modified foods, and regulations.\n2. Structure of plant cell, totipotency of plant cell, dedefferentiation and redifferntiation, tissue culture and plant hormones, cell fusion and cybrid, principles of plant genetic engineering, molecular mechanism of crown gall formation with infection of Agrobacterium.\n3. Transformation methods with binary vectors of Agrobacterium, and particle gun.\n4. Selective marker-free transgenic plants, principles and applications of reverse genetics, T-DNA tagging method.\n5. Control of fruit riping by down-regulation of ethylene synthesis, insect tolerance.\n6. Herbicide tolerance (glyphosate, glufosinate, sulfonylurea, 2,4-D).\n7. Pest tolerance (over-production of viral coat protein, RNA degradation by PTGS, R gene, chitinase, plant defensine).\n8. The second generation of genetically modified foods (Golden Rice、oleate rich soy bean、tryptophan rich rice, ferritin-containing rice、rice to repress choresterol、low allergen-containing rice, rice for insulin secretion, banana containing viral antigen, rice for cedar pollen allergy)\n9. Alternation of flower color (pigments of flower, pH theory, metal chelete theory, copigment theory, anthocyanidin biosynthetic pathway, delphinidin, F3'5'H, blue carnation and rose)\n10. Control of flowering and flower shapes(leafy, needly, ABC model, superman)\n11. Stress tolerance 1(cold, drought, freezing, salinity, high temperature, inhibition of photosynthesis, compatibe solutes, GPAT, phosphatidyl glycerol, active oxygen species)\n12. Stress tolerance 2(light and active oxygen species, superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, mannitol)\n13. Air pollution tolerant plants, tolerance to iron-deficience (mugineic acids)\n14. Phytoremediation (phytochelatin, mercury tolerance, arsenic tolerance, heavy metal tolerance, volatile environmental pollutants)\n15. conclusions\n16. Exam.","prerequisites":"genetic engineering, molecular biology\n\nStudents will do homework on biology for high school.\nStudents take the lecture for 30 hrs, and are also recommend to prepare for and revise the lectures by using texts, references and handouts, spending the standard amount of time (60 hrs)as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"No textbook required.
