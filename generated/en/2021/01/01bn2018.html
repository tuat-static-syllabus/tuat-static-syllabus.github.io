Chemosensory systems such as odorant, pheromone and taste receptions are closely related but a little bit different each other in using molecule and mechanisms of systems between mammals and insects. Students must understand current situation of scientific understanding of these matters. In the second half of this course, we deepen our understanding of the hierarchy of life, which is the cornerstone of biology, through the International System of Units (SI) and the physical quantities of the environment surrounding organisms. We also introduce the diverse phenotypes of organisms interwoven by gene-environment interactions and their molecular mechanisms.","expected_learning":"Regarding first seven, biological interaction, one of the major purpose upholded in the diploma policy will be focused. In particular, \"Offense and defense between microorganisms and host animals\" and \"searching and recognition of food or male and female\" will be told as themes in the lecture. Students are expected to be able to explain about those using words concerning molecules including proteins. In the second half of this course, we focus on subjects related to one of the diploma policy “A series of biological phenomena and functions ranging from molecules, cells, and individuals to the activities and interactions of biotic communities” in the Department of Applied Biological Science to acquire basic knowledge that contributes to plant production and pest control, and to be able to explain the environmental responses of organisms from physiological and molecular biological aspects.\nRefer to the curriculum map for the three policies on the following Department HP.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/department/agriculture/bio/curriculum.html\n","course_schedule":"By Ryoichi Sato:\n1-3. Reason why infectious bacteria can infect and trigger disease to the host\n1) Toxin, Molecular structure, mode of action, and application of a molecular machine, BT insecticidal toxin\n2) Application of technology and science of toxins\n3) Binding factor, invasive factor, anti-host defense factor\n4-5. Reason why animals can defend themselves from attacks by non-infectious microorganisms.\n4) Molecules consisting innate immunity, anti-microbial peptides and non-self recognition receptors, and principle of specific binding realized by proteins.\n5) Molecules monitored by the innate immunity.\n6-7. Molecular mechanisms of odorant, pheromone and taste reception and their recognition.\n6) Molecular mechanisms of odorant and pheromone reception in mammals and insects.\n7) Molecular mechanisms of taste reception in mammals and insects.\n\nBy Takeshi Suzuki:\n8) Hierarchy of life\n9) International system of units (SI)\n10) Physical quantities of environment\n11) Environmental responses in plants to light environments\n12) Environmental responses in plants to gas environments\n13) Environmental responses in animals and phenotypic plasticity\n14) Mystery of the Cambrian explosion\n\n15) Summary of the course and examination\n","prerequisites":"Molecular biology, Cell biology, Biochemistry","texts_and_materials":"Prints will be prepared by teachers.","assessment":"Each half of the lecture has 50% weight for the assessment.
