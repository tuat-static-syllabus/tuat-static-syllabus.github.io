Therefore, it is a required subject for students learning applied plant science. In this lecture, \"Growth and Differentiation\" and \"Energy and Metabolism\" in plant cells are reviewed mainly and the basic knowledge in this field are explained.\n\nIn the section of ‘Growth and Differentiation’, we learn about plant hormones, their function and their roles in agriculture, as well as the mechanisms of plant responses to the environment. In the section of ‘Energy and Metabolism’, the mechanism of photosynthesis is described in detail, as it is the most important mechanism that enables plants to serve as producers. In each lecture, important points are clearly indicated in the form of questions and students are advised to think about the answers to such questions during the lectures in order to deepen their understanding. Many technical terms and ‘jargons’ will appear in the lectures but the list will be provided. Students are encouraged to study using the important points and the list of jargons, as well as data and figures provided in the class to build a systematic understanding on plant physiology.\n\nThis is part of the Courses of Plant Production Science, and its completion is recommended for students in the Department of Biological Production.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand a basic physiology of the plant hormone and a photosynthetic process.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\n　　See the Curriculum maps.\n　　(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )","course_schedule":"1　(1) What is the plant physiology?\n(2) Agriculture and plant physiology\n2　Growth and differentiation\n(1) Growth and the differentiation\n(2) Plant hormones and their physiological function\n3　(3) Physiological function of auxin\n4　(4) Physiological function of gibberellin\n5　(5) Physiological function of cytokinin\n6　(6) Physiological function of ethylene\n7　(7) Physiological function of abscisic acid\n(8) Physiological function of brassinosteroid\n8 (9) Signal transduction of plant hormones (receptors for plant hormones, G protein)\n9　(9) Signal transduction of plant hormones (protein kinases)\n(10) Light signals in growth and differentiation\n10　Energy and Metabolism ---Photosynthesis---\n(1) ATP molecules and energy\n11 (2) Structure and function of chloroplasts (thylakoid, stroma etc.)\n12 (3) Light absorption and energy conversion\n13 (4) Electron transport pathways and ATP synthesis in chloroplasts\n14 (5) Photosynthetic carbon fixation reaction in C3 plants\n15 (6) Photorespiration and other carbon dioxide fixation reactions (photorespiration, C4 plant, CAM plant)\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for\nand revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and\nusing the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Prints are distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"Examinations 100%","message_from_instructor":"I would like students to develop a deeper understanding of biological activities of plants that are the foundation of life on Earth, from the aspects of energy, metabolism, and regulatory mechanisms of growth.
