In this lecture, students study on how we describe phenomena in a mathematical forms. By solving excersices in each class, you can understand basics in modeling. This class focuses on fundamental issues of mathematical modeling. We study some practical topics, such as momentum flux and catalyst reaction with mass transfer. We study some practical problems related to momentum and surface reaction on catalyst with mass transfer, and so on.","expected_learning":"Understanding a basics of mathematical modeling","course_schedule":"The contents below would be changed depending upon your understanding.\n\n・Estimation of temperature of planets in the solar system\n・Origin of pressure and estimation of pressure and temperature at the top of a mountain\n・Mass balance equation in Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor(CSTR).\n・Mass balance equation in Plug flor Reactor (PFR).\n・Fundamental equations for heat exchangers (Parallel Flow)\n・Fundamental equations for heat exchangers (Countercurrent Flow)\n・Evaporation of water in a glass.\n・Evaporation of a water droplet in air\n\nExam\n・Momentum tranfer in fluids\n・Mass transfer, adsorption and surface reaction on catalyst (i)\n・Mass transfer, adsorption and surface reaction on catalyst (ii)\n・Formation of fouling layer and thermal resistance\n・Rate-limiting step and approximate solution(i): catalyst reaction\n・Rate-limiting step and approximate solution (ii): heat transfer via tube\n・Dimensionless form of differential equations: time constants and their physical meaning\n・Summary\nExam\n\nSolution of a model and understanding using the solution\nChemical reactions and heat balance\nfundamental equations for heat exchangers\nNumerical solution for unsteady state problems\n\n","prerequisites":"Students should understand fundamental methods to solve diffrential equations.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Excersize in each class and the final examination are considered for evaluation.Total score is 100 and students with a score more than 60 are certified.
