Whereas it is desired for production utilizing genetic engineering to ensure steady supply of herbs, their metabolic system is extremely diverse, differing from one plant species to another, and many aspects are still unknown. On the other hand, the progress of comprehensive analytical technology has placed us in an age in which the expression of genes relevant to the metabolic system, revelation of their enzymatic proteins and the quantities of metabolic products can be analyzed in the same process. In view of this circumstance, the course is intended to help students understand simultaneous analysis of metabolic products and the secondary metabolic system of plants. For this purpose, the scope of lectures will range from understanding of research methods to revelation of metabolic systems of plants (including methods using radioactive isotopes), outlining of secondary metabolic products of various plants and their synthetic systems, studying on production of useful substances from plants, and their utilization in engineering.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1st: Characteristics of plant metabolic system.

Practical aspects of metabolomic analysis cutting its cross section (comprehensive simultaneous analyis using GC-MS, LC-MS and FT-MS).\n2nd: Inference of metabolic system. Practical aspects of metabolic system inference, taking up sugar metabolism as example (method of singling out, when there are multiple enzymes having a similar activity, what is a member of the enzyme group taking part in which metabolic system, measurement of metabolic flow and energy flow by measuring C6/C1 ratio, and measurement of intracellular substance and energy cycles). Experiments using a tracer (radioactive isotope). Synthesis of the tracer (radioactive isotope) and its specific activity. Inference of metabolic system using cold trap method.\n3rd: Nitrogen metabolism in plants. Photosynthesis is not the only role of chloroplast.

Above all, secondary metabolic systems have played an important role. While some such systems retain the resistivity working beneficially to plants’ survival even now, others which are no longer required because predators have already disappeared or some other reason still remain as “vestigial metabolic systems”, and they are utilized for pharmaceutical or other purposes. I would like for my students to understand the variety of such systems and their engineering usefulness.","course_keywords":"Secondary metabolic system, production of useful substances from plants, plant pigment, amino acid synthesis","office_hours":"From 1 to 2 p.m. every Tuesday.
