Students will conduct laboratory work at the research laboratories of faculty members in other research institutes within the three universities.\nStudents will learn ideas and social implementation approaches in other fields as well as improve their ability to adapt and communicate in different research environments by conducting laboratory work (equivalent to 30 classes) at the research laboratories of faculty members in other research institutes within the three universities.","expected_learning":"The main purpose of the course is to establish the foundation for the students to become doctoral degree-holders with advanced capabilities for conducting practical research. In particular, the course will help them improve and practice their skills in evidence-based logical contextualization, coordination, and presentation, which are needed in accurately communicating their opinions to experts.","course_schedule":"Working students who are unable to intern at the candidate host institutions and companies due to complex reasons, such as corporate confidentiality issues and time constraints imposed by annual vacation leaves, will conduct laboratory work at the research laboratories of faculty members in other research institutes within the three universities. The principal supervisor will plan the internship in consideration of the student’s specialization, future career plan, and research theme, while consulting with the host faculty member and with the support of the assistant supervisor, in close coordination with the student.\nThe theme of the laboratory work will be discussed and decided by the supervisor, the student, and host faculty member. The student will prepare the plan and must receive approval from the principal supervisor and the host faculty member. During the performance of the laboratory work, the student will be required to prepare reports as necessary and receive comments and feedback from the host faculty member.\nAfter completing the laboratory work, the students will submit a report (approx. five A4 sheets of paper) summarizing the training content and achievements to the principal supervisor. Students will also be required to report the content of their laboratory work training and achievements, along with the progress of their doctoral dissertation research in the collaborative humanities and sciences colloquium as part of the “Advanced Practicum in Sustainability Research II - IV” Practicum Course.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"None in particular","assessment":"Overall evaluation will be made based on attitude and initiative towards preparing for the laboratory work (plans, etc.), achievements (reports, etc.), etc.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/2/2021 3:45:06 PM","name":{"id":2278,"ja":"学内実践実習","en":"Intramural Internship"},"instructor":{"id":2391,"ja":"千年 篤, 伊藤 輝将","en":"CHITOSE Atsushi, ITO Terumasa"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Doctor)","category":"courses for doctoral programs","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"None in particular"}}
