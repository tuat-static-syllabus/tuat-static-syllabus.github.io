Then clarify the results and contribution with discussion with instruction supervisor and laboratory members will be done, and finally clarify the direction of research.","expected_learning":"This course is related to the Master students who enter the Lab for ２ years. During a year, students will start thinking about an experiment (in case of our Lab. it is simulation) subject from the beginning and then by doing experiment(in this case doing experiments and/or simulation), the students will be able to learn the whole process. They will be able to make something from the beginning. As they have to make a presentation about their results, they will learn how to write reports and power points. They will be experts at the end of the year. This is extremely necessary for them when they enter a company or enrol into graduate school.","course_schedule":"It carries out in each laboratory.\nThe contents of the experiment are determined after making arrangements with an instruction supervisor.\nAfter arguing with an instruction supervisor minutely about the experiment method, a meeting, a seminar, etc. release the result obtained by advancing, and it examines the result will be done in sequence.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"The measure for simulation execution and the validity of a simulation result are evaluated.","message_from_instructor":"You need to do experiments (simulation) almost every day.
