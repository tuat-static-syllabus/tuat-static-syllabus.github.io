Several applications on automotive control as well as aircraft dynamics control are described based on control theories. Classical control and Modern control theories are introduced in the class. The theory of state observer and Kalman filtering are also introduced.\n\n","expected_learning":"Students are expected to understand the controller design procedure in order to realize the control objectives and accordingly be able to apply the basic theory of feedback control system on mechanical systems. Students can explain the procedure of feedback control system design.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Google Classroom Code : hupjys3\nZoom will be used for online lecture platform.
