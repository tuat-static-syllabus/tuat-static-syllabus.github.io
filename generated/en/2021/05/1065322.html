Finally, the points which may find out to be logically short will be clarified.","expected_learning":"This course is related to the Master students ２nd year. During a year, students will start thinking about advanced research and then by doing advanced research, the students will be able to learn the whole process. They will be able to make something from the beginning. As they have to make a presentation about their results, they will learn how to write reports and power points. They will be experts at the end of the year. This is extremely necessary for them when they enter a company or enrol into graduate school.","course_schedule":"It carries out in each laboratory.\nThe contents of the experiment are determined after making arrangements with an instruction supervisor.\nAfter arguing with an instruction supervisor minutely about the experiment method, a meeting, a seminar, etc. release the result obtained by advancing, and it examines the result will be done in sequence.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"The validity of the simulations result and precedence nature will be evaluated.","message_from_instructor":"You need to do advanced research (simulation) almost every day.
