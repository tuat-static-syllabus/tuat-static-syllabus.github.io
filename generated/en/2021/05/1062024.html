The course consists of two parts. In the former part (held in the first semester), students will learn core and applied parts of chemical engineering, i.e., transport phenomena of momentum, heat, and mass transfer. In the latter part (held in the third semester), students will perform literature reviews regarding state-of-the-art in the field of their master theses, give a presentation of the reviews, and reply to questions. Throughout the activities, students will acquire skills to command English to reach a master's degree level.","expected_learning":"In the former part of the course, students can understand analogies of momentum, heat, and mass transfers.\nIn the latter part of the course, students can rationally explain a border between what has been previously known and what has not been known. And they can understand the contents of other students' presentations and actively participate in the discussion.","course_schedule":"The former parts are comprised of series of lectures by three professors\nWeeks 1-4: Heat transfer\nWeeks 5-8: Momentum transfer\nWeeks 9-12: Mass transfer\nHomeworks and the final examination will be held.\n\nThe latter parts will be held in laboratories to which students belong. For details, students need to ask their supervisors. In most cases, students will tackle on literature reviews of their master theses, summary them as a report, and give a presentation.\n","prerequisites":"Preferably, students have learned the basics of chemical engineering.","texts_and_materials":"Transport Phenomena (2nd Ed.) by R. Bird, W. Stewart, and E. Lightfoot will be used.","assessment":"Assessment will be performed according to the exam of the former part and the activities and performances in their laboratories. The grade is S as the highest, followed by A, B, C, and D. Taking D means the credits are not granted. To get the grade, more than 70% of attendance to classes is mandatory.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Chemical engineering, transport phenomena, analogy, momentum, heat transfer, and mass transfer","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"Students are required to bring a scientific electronic calculator.","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"7/26/2021 11:06:08 AM","name":{"id":1248,"ja":"応用化学セミナーⅠ","en":"Applied Chemistry: Advanced Seminar Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":510,"ja":"寺田 昭彦","en":"TERADA Akihiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"common courses","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":"According to necessity, a reference will be introduced."}}
