In this lecture, we will learn about various problems handled in \"Layout design\" which is the final stage of the lecture, how they are modeled, and what kind of efficient algorithms are solved. With this knowledge gained knowledge of the automatic design procedure of the VLSI layout and it is expected that when it becomes necessary to solve some problem, we can learn the procedure to formulate the problem and solve it efficiently.","expected_learning":"・ Understand how to model practical problems and formulate them into combinatorial optimization problems.\n・ Understand the efficient solutions and limits of various combinatorial optimization problems.\n","course_schedule":"After every lecture we will do exercises as much as possible and we will proceed to understand the content of the lecture on that day on the spot.
