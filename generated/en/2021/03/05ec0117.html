Therefore, it is a required subject for students learning Field of Functional Control of Natural Resources.\n\nProf. Saito will give a lecture on fundamentals and potential applications of the cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are introduced. CNFs can be structurally defined as dispersions of the 3-nm-wide fibrillar units of biologically structured celluloses in trees, and are emerging materials that combine outstanding mechanical performances, thermal dimensional stability, and lightweight properties. CNF-based new industries are now being created.\n\nProf. Inoue will give a lecture on the basic knowledge and skills on forest education and MOKUIKU that widely spreading the goodness of wood and the use of wood. We will provide an overview of forest education, environmental education, and wood education MOKUIKU. In addition, we will experience of educational programs, and we will make a plan and implement educational programs with group activities.\" Learn about the effects of forest resources on people's bodies and minds, and deepen their understanding of how to use resources in living space and maintain health. We also learn about extraction methods, component compositions, analysis methods, etc. In addition, you actually measure the physiological response when you smell.\"","expected_learning":"Prof. Saito:Students study fundamental properties of preparation methods, sturcture and dispersion principle, and undearstand a current issue and their solution as well as their applicatoin.\nProf. Inoue:The standard for this lecture are to be able to understand significance of wood utilization for create a sustainable society, and to understand the basic knowledge of environmental education, forest education, and MOKUIKU, and to participate in the planning and management of educational programs.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/)","course_schedule":"Prof. Saito will give lectures as follows,\n1) Structure of native cellulose\n2) Conversion to cellulose nanofibers\n3) Fundamental properties of cellulose nanofibers\n4) Composites of cellulose nanofibers\n5) Problems and their countermeasures\n\nProf. Inoue will give lectures as follows,\n1) Outline of forest education and environmental education and MOKUIKU, and to understand significance of utilization of wood for environment.\n2) Practical training in forest education and MOKUIKU programs\n3) Planning and practice of forest education and MOKUIKU programs\n4) Discussion about significance and issues of Forest Education and MOKUIKU (Group Discussion)","prerequisites":"Students are recommended to spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University","texts_and_materials":"Prof. Saito:Handouts will be given\nProf. Inoue:“Wood Proficiency Test” managed by the wood proficiency test committee in the Society of Wood Utilization System (on-line examination system) or, textbooks about it.","assessment":"Prof. Saito:Assessment will be calculated according to Usual performance score and Report (100 %).\nProf. Inoue:tasks in the class (50%), and report after the class (50%).","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Prof. Saito:Cellulose, nanofiber, wood biomass, structural control, characteristic expression.; Prof. Inoue:Environmental education, forest education, MOKUIKU, forestry extension, outdoor education","office_hours":"Prof. Saito:Contact by an e-mail. asaitot@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp.; Prof. Inoue:The office hour is about 30 minutes after the class.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/29/2021 4:30:14 PM","name":{"id":2215,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅲ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅢ"},"instructor":{"id":2346,"ja":"堀川 祥生, 齋藤 継之, 井上 真理子","en":"HORIKAWA Yoshiki, SAITO Tsuguyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"2nd","course_type":"2nd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Prof. Saito: References will be anounced in the class.\nProf. Inoue:OISHI.
