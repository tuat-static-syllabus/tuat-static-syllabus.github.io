Medicinal chemistry is an interdisciplinary scientific field related to multiple research areas such as organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, structural biology and informatics. In this class, we learn about the road of drug discovery by focusing on the structure and function of biologically active compounds, as well as about current status and issues of low-molecular-weight pharmaceutics. We also learn about the basis of chemical biology used for drug discovery.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand the basis of medicinal chemistry, strategy and tactics of drug discovery.\n","course_schedule":"Day 1: Overview of medicinal chemistry\nDay 2 (and 3): Strategy and tactics of drug discovery, current status and issues of low-molecular-weight pharmaceutics.\n","prerequisites":"This class is opened for graduate students.","texts_and_materials":"Nothing specially","assessment":"Attendance (50%), Report (50%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"medicinal chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, chemical biology, biologically active compounds, drug discovery","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/29/2021 4:49:56 PM","name":{"id":2214,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅱ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅡ"},"instructor":{"id":2345,"ja":"芳賀 尚樹, 足立 泰久, 藤井 晋也, 四方 俊幸","en":"HAGA Naoki, ADACHI Yasuhisa, SHIKATA Toshiyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":"The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, 4th Edition, C.
