However, that means the resource shift and great transformation of the global political and economic structure. In this lecture, the historical significance of the energy transformation is clarified, and the background which promotes the transformation, technical problems, and political and economic problems are lectured.\n\n[Ozaki]\nHazardous trace elements, such as heavy metals, are non-degradable pollutants and cause semi-permanent environmental pollution. In Cs-137 pollution caused by the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant accident, its half-life is as long as more than 30 years. This lecture deals with the actual condition of these inorganic and trace pollutants. Moreover, assuming a field survey necessary to clarify the actual situation, fundamental matters for sampling will be learned.\n","expected_learning":"[Kimura]\nWhile reviewing the latest knowledge, tackle problems without answers free from stereotypes.\n\n[Ozaki]\nPromote understanding of the current state of environmental pollution issues. Understand the basic points of sampling methods to understand the actual situation. To enable students to explain how their research content, such as master's thesis, is positioned in society. At the end of the lecture, I would like to think about environmental issues with the students.\n\n\n\n","course_schedule":"[Kimura]\n\n(1)(2) History of energy transformation: Transformation process to fossil fuel use from the 17th century and its consequence.\n\n(3) On the modern energy transformation movement and policy theory movement, the movement of the international challenge to the climate change problem and policy theory of the climate change countermeasure based on it are lectured.\n\n(4) Present situation and the problems of nuclear power: The global use of nuclear power starts after WWII. Especially, it grows rapidly under the US's strategy of \"Atoms for Peace\". However, since the 1980 s, its spread has stagnated and has levelled off in recent years. Give a lecture on the background.\n\n(5) Renewable energy and its policy: Renewable energy resources and trends in their utilization technologies are explained, and lectures on policy on their popularization and expansion.\n\n(6) Two problems with renewable energy: The problems of renewable energy are the cost and the natural fluctuation. Give a lecture on how these two problems were dealt with and the present situation in the world.\n\n(7) Japan's energy policy and its problems: The drift of Japan's modern energy policy is lectured. Finally, the policies that Japan should take to change are discussed.\n\n\n[Ozaki]\n(1) What is the environmental problems?\n\n(2)(3) Actual situation of environmental pollution with hazardous trace elements\n\n(4) Sampling method by using the conventional method.\n\n(5) Sampling method by random sampling\n\n(6) Comparison of the analytical results obtained by the above two methods\n\n(7) How many samples are needed? Calculation of statistical required number and actual response","prerequisites":"None","texts_and_materials":"Materials are distributed on the day.","assessment":"[Kimura] Fiinal Report: 100%\n[Ozaki] Final Report: 100%","message_from_instructor":"[Kimura]\nTechnology, economy and political circumstances over energy are changing rapidly. Based on this, I expect students the flexibility to update information based on the latest data and evidence.\n\n[Ozaki]\nWhen engaging in environmental issues, it is crucial to understand the field and think about the relationship with related fields. In addition to learning about various cases, you should also learn the basics of sampling methods needed to understand the actual situation.","course_keywords":"Energy transformation; decarbonisation, renewable energy, nuclear power, heavy metals, random sampling, statistical comparison","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/17/2021 4:18:53 PM","name":{"id":2217,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅴ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅤ"},"instructor":{"id":2348,"ja":"多羅尾 光徳, 尾崎 宏和, 木村 啓二","en":"TARAO Mitsunori"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"2nd","course_type":"2nd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Stephen Waite (2000) Statistical Ecology in Practice: A Guide to Analysing Environmental and Ecological Field Data. 440pp., Longman Group United Kingdom"}}
