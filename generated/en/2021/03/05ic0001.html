Linkages among hydrologic and geomorphic processes are emphasized, as are the effect of regional land use. Issues of scales related to hydrological/geomorphic response and system behavior are explored, as well as timely topics related to sustainable land management and natural hazard assessment. Emphasis will be places on hydrologic and geomorphic processes in steep terrain. Students will be encouraged to contribute to discussions on catchment processes and land management for regional environmental planning in this course.\n","expected_learning":"Students will understand basics of hydrology and geomorphology for developing the interactive discussion of watershed management.\n\nDetail information is provided in the following map. https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\n","course_schedule":"** Outline of course work **\nLecture #1: Self-introduction and overview of the course.
