Toshiyuki Fukuhara, Masahiro Natsume and Satoshi Nakamura, give lectures about recent topics of Bioregulation and Biointeraction.\nFukuhara: Versatile functions of RNAs in plants, especially, RNA interference (RNA silencing) and RNA-derected DNA methylation.\nNatsume: Growth and differentiation of microorganisms and interaction between microb-microb and microb-plant are regulated by not only genes or proteins but also low-molecular-weight organic substances. This course provides various examples of discovery, isolation and structure elucidation, biosynthesis and mode of action of such physiologically active substances.\nNakamura: This course provides students with Applied entomology and biological control of insect pests.\n","expected_learning":"To understand RNA interference, bio-active substances and Applied entomology.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\n","course_schedule":"Fukuhara\n1. Regulation of gene expression by small RNAs I: Post-transcriptional gene silencing by miRNAs or siRNAs.\n2. Regulation of gene expression by small RNAs II: Transcriptional gene silencing by small RNA-directed DNA methylation.\n3. Defense against virus infection by RNA silencing.\n4. Application of RNA interference and RNA-directed DNA methylation.\n\nNatsume\n1. How to proceed research in the chemistry of bio-active substances\n2. Differentiation-inducing substance of the microorganism\n3. Antagonism between microorganisms\n4. Aerial mycelium-inducing substance in actinomycete\n5. Chemical basis of plant-microb interactions\n6. Chemical communication in plants\n\nNakamura\nUnderstanding of characteristics of insect natural enemies, techniques for using insect natural enemies and spread the knowledge and techniques in the economically developing countries.","prerequisites":"In addition to the lectures in the class, you are recommended to prepare and review the class using the standard amount of time as specified by the university for each class.","texts_and_materials":"Google classroom","assessment":"Examination, Report, and questions in every class.\nEach professor will assess, and they will discuss to decide the final assessment.\n","message_from_instructor":"Please check \"Moodle\" and print handouts before you take a class.","course_keywords":"Bio-active substances, RNA interference, Natural enemies, biological control, economically developing countries","office_hours":"10:30-17:00 in every Monday","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://www.tuat.ac.jp/~mcb/","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"1/29/2021 10:20:38 AM","name":{"id":2140,"ja":"生物制御科学Ⅲ","en":"Bioregulation and Biointeraction Ⅲ"},"instructor":{"id":1617,"ja":"福原 敏行, 夏目 雅裕, 中村 達","en":"FUKUHARA Toshiyuki, NATSUME Masahiro, NAKAMURA Satoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"8-212","day_period":"Mon.1","references":"RNAi, CSHL press"}}
