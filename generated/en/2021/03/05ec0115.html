The outline of the lecture is as follows.\nNature always creates patterns including shapes, colors and movements, which strongly connect with various functions in lives. The pattern-property relationship can also inspire and guide a novel fabrication of bio-based materials, which is the main research concept of our laboratory. At first attempts should be made to understand the pattern, and based on the understanding, a design for fabrication of unique materials would be made. In this way, we can develop superior bio-based materials with 3-D novel nano/micro hierarchical structures. It is no doubt that our proposed methods are environmentally friendly, and therefore they should be compared with conventional methods in terms of both energy efficiency and cost performance.\n\nProf. Tadashi Ohtani of Tokyo Gakugei University. The outline of the lecture is as follows.\nWith the recent demand for a low-carbon society worldwide, in the world of wood use, correct understanding for the use of wood, especially domestic timber, and the treatment for processing wood is an important role. This lecture is aim to deep understanding of the use of wood in a low-carbon society, and discussing the research results of the forefront of wood processing from the viewpoint of processing biological materials. In addition, based on this lecture, as a young researcher (graduate student) in a research organization, the lecture is considered our own research value to induce scientific and technological innovation when engaging in research on environmental resources and material science. Furthermore, based on the current state of innovation research in Japan, the aim is to deepen the understanding of how each research theme contributes to the utilization of environmental resources and material science.\n\n","expected_learning":"You can learn the latest information on Environmental Science and Natural Resources.\n\nThe educational achievement of this lecture is to learn the basics such as social background, types and properties of environmentally friendly polymers. Students will also be able to explain the synthesis and materialization of plastics derived from biomass, development guidelines, and future performance requirements.\n\nLearn and deepen the understanding about environmentally friendly polymers to explore the way for effective use of biomass resources in terms of their social background, chemical structures, properties, synthesis and processing.\n\nUnderstand low-carbon societies and the use of wood in Japan.\nUnderstand the principle of processing.\nTo deepen understanding of advanced research on processing of biological materials.\nUnderstand the relationship between science and technology research in Japan and innovation.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\nURL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"Intensive lecture will be held from the latest information on Environmental Science and Natural Resources.\n\n\nProf. Tetsuo Kondo\nWhat is “Biomaterials”?\nHow does formation of “Hierarchical structures” proceed in biological systems?　　　　　　　\nBaterial design of synthetic polymeric materials as references to biomaterial design　　　　　　　\nPresence and future developments of biomaterial design\n\n\nProf. Tadashi Ohtani\n1) Low carbon society and wood use\n2) Study on processing science of biological materials\n3) Science and technology research and innovation\n\n\n","prerequisites":"Students are recommended to spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University","texts_and_materials":"Distribute prints as appropriate.","assessment":"Regular point and report submission","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Please request an appointment by email.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/26/2021 2:00:58 PM","name":{"id":2213,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅰ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅠ"},"instructor":{"id":2344,"ja":"安藤 恵介, 近藤 哲男, 大谷 忠","en":"ANDO Keisuke, KONDOH Tetsuo, OOTANI Tadashi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学府","category":"","department":"","semester":"2学期","course_type":"2学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":"Introduce in class if necessary."}}
