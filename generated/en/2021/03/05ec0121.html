And the other 14 lectures will be conducted in the afternoon of Thursday from the end of May to mid-July. Detailed dates and lecturers will be announced in Classroom in April.\n\nArtificial nitrogen (N) fixation technology developed in earth 20th century has enabled human to create ammonia (NH3) from molecular N (N2) in the atmosphere. The fixed N is used for mainly chemical fertilizer production which has steadily increased the human food production. Whereas, human N use efficiency is very low, ca. 80% in the world, and induces a vast amount of N loss to the environment. Although N2 is inert and harmless, other forms of N, collectively called as reactive N, e.g., NH3, nitrogen oxides (NOX), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitrate (NO3-) released to the environment causes a variety of impacts such as global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, air pollution, water pollution, acidification, and eutrophication harmful to both human and ecosystem health. Thus, human N uses is a tradeoff between the benefit as fertilizers and materials and the threats to human and ecosystem health, that is called ‘N issue’. Right knowledge on human sector N flows, flows of N loss to the environment, and N dynamics in the environment and their impacts is indispensable for addressing the entangled N issue. In this course, the current knowledge on N and environmental science is exposited. Furthermore, the hot activities in Japan and the world to cope with the N issue are also explained.","expected_learning":"By the end of this class, students will be able to: (1) understand the outline of N dynamics in the environmental media such as air, soil, water, and ecosystem, (2) understand the comprehensive picture of N flows with human activity and its impacts on the environment, and (3) gain knowledge in the most recent international activities to address the N issue.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"This class is the omnibus style lecture conducted by the instructors.\n\nThe lecturers and the contents of the planned lecture are as follows.
