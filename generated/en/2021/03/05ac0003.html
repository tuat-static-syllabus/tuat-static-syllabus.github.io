The lecture also provides students with the knowledge needed to develop solutions for research on plant production sciences.\n\nThe knowledges, such as phytohormone and the signal transduction in plant cells, in the plant molecular physiology are explained in the first half of this lecture. Moreover, the latest knowledges on new plant breeding techniques in the plant molecular breeding are lectured in the latter half.\n","expected_learning":"*Understanding the new breeding techniques used in plant breeding through learning of theory, principle, and application examples of them.\n\n*Understanding the meaning of data provided by biochemical and molecular biological analysis in plant sciences.\n\n\nSee the curriculum maps.\n　　https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"Omnibus/15 periods total\n\nTetsuya Yamada (8 periods)\nIn the lectures, principles and application examples of breeding techniques to assist traditional breeding methods are explained in detail. In addition to marker-assisted selection and recombinant DNA techniques, new plant breeding techniques (NBT) such as genome editing using artificial nucleases and epigenome editing using RNA-depending DNA methylation are introduced.\n\nUnit 1 Introduction\n\nUnit 2 Traditional breeding methods 1: marker-assisted selection (MAS)\n\nUnit 3 Traditional breeding methods 2: Recombinant DNA techniques, cisgenesis and intragenesis\n\nUnit 4 Genome editing 1: artificial nucleases\n\nUnit 5 Genome editing 2: Meganuclease, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)\n\nUnit 6 Genome editing 3: TALEN, CRISPR/Cas system\n\nUnit 7 Epigenome editing 1: RNA-depending DNA methylation (RdDM)\n\nUnit 8 Epigenome editing 2: Grafting on GM rootstock\n\n\nMotoki Kanekatsu (7 periods)\nPlants make a lot of response to signals of light, phytohormones and environmental stress. Many factors, such as receptors, G-protein, protein kinase and transcriptional factors, play important roles in these processes. In this lecture, the functions of these factors and signal transduction in plant cells are explained using data of the past superior articles. In addition, the　technical principle in the field of molecular biology and biochemistry is introduced.\n\nUnit 9 Usefulness of the mutants in plant sciences (1)\n---The factors which play important roles in response to gibberellin---\n\nUnit 10 Usefulness of the mutants in plant sciences (2)\n--- Signal transduction system of gibberellin ---\nUnit 11 MAP kinase cascade\n\nUnit 12 Two component system (1)\n--- Activation tagging method and cytokinin---\nUnit 13 Two component system (2)\n--- Signal transduction of cytokinin ---\nUnit 14 The receptor for ABA\n\nUnit 15 The signal transduction system of ABA\n\n","prerequisites":"This lecture is an elective subject, and is one of the specialized subjects.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (30 hours).\n","texts_and_materials":"Prints are distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"Examinations 100%","message_from_instructor":"We hope that this lecture will help you on your research in the future.","course_keywords":"Plant molecular physiology, Plant molecular breeding","office_hours":"From 11:00 to 12:30 on Tuesday (Kanekatsu)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/1/2021 5:47:51 PM","name":{"id":2134,"ja":"植物生産科学Ⅰ","en":"Plant Production Science Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":1611,"ja":"金勝 一樹, 山田 哲也","en":"KANEKATSU Motoki, YAMADA Tetsuya"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Fri.2","references":"テイツ/ザイガー「植物生理学・発生学」講談社"}}
