However, rumen fermentation of high-fiber diets involves the increase in the production of methane, which is gaining negative attention as a greenhouse gas. Low-fiber/high-grain diets, on the other hand, has been known to achieve high performance with lower methane production, but to lead the increase in the risk of various systemic metabolic disorders. This lecture will provide firstly the basic function and mechanisms of rumen fermentation, then physiological risk of high-concentrate diet and the responsibility of ruminal methane for global warming, and finaly, introduce some methods and recent studies to reduce methane emission from ruminants.\n","expected_learning":"1．Understanding the mechanisms maintaining ruminal condition\n2．Understanding the role of rumen methanogenesis in rumen fermrntation\n3．Understanding the potential risks of high-grain feeding in ruminant animals\n4．Understanding the environmental impact of rumen-derived methane\n","course_schedule":"1．Mechanisms maintaining rumen condition\n2．Role of methanogenesis in rumen fermrntation\n3．Physiological effects of high-grain feeding in ruminants\n4．Environmental impact of ruminal methane and its reducing method\n","prerequisites":"Attendee must carry out individual studies by referring lecture materials and others according to the standard number of hours of the University.","texts_and_materials":"Materials for the lecture are passed on the day.","assessment":"Class participation and attitude 20%: based on questions and answers in the class\nReport 80%: based on the expected learning as above\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Ruminants, rumen fermentation, rumen acidosis, methane","office_hours":"Questions are accepted at the end of the lecture.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"10/7/2021 2:32:29 PM","name":{"id":1647,"ja":"動物栄養飼料学特論","en":"Advanced Animal Nutrition and Feed Science"},"instructor":{"id":2401,"ja":"須藤 まどか（茨）","en":"SUTOH Madoka"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"連合農学研究科","category":"","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"連合農学研究科","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":"Materials for the lecture are passed on the day."}}
