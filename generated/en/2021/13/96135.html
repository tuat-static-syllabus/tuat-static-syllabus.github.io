By understanding the topics published in these top journals on their own, they will learn the latest knowledge and techniques in agriculture, and as a result, they will be positioned as lecture subjects to acquire advanced specialized abilities in the field of bioregulatory chemistry.\n","expected_learning":"・ Understand the biosynthesis of low-molecular-weight organic compounds at the substance level, enzyme function level, and gene expression level.\n・ How do you understand not only the content of the papers of the top journals (Q1 journal level) but also the points to be adopted? (Common understanding for being aware of manuscript submissions as original paper that you will have in the future.)\n","course_schedule":"・ Biosynthesis of plant hormones and their functions.\n・ The role of the plant hormone gibberellin in higher plants.\n・ Structure and function of gibberellin-type hormonal substances in lower land plants (mosses).\n・ Biosynthesis and molecular evolution of allelochemicals that respond to fungi, pests and environmental stress in land plants.","prerequisites":"nothing special.
