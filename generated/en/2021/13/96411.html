Students will learn about water use and conservation of fish habitat in rivers and canals through classroom lectures and numerical analysis using computers. With examples in Shiga and Ibaraki Prefectures, lectures are given on water withdrawal from a river for agriculture and hydroelectric power generation and hydraulic environment affecting fish habitat in a river and a canal. Simulation and prediction of stream flow are conducted by a two-dimensional flow model. The course will be held online on July, 1st, 3rd year of Reiwa.\n","expected_learning":"１．Understanding water use in agricultural lands and watershed\n２．Understanding a method of numerical analysis on stream flow in rivers and canals\n","course_schedule":"１．Use of river water and fish habitat\n２．Fish habitat in canals\n３．Evaluation method of fish habitat\n４．Numerical analysis of stream flow\n","prerequisites":"Please bring your lap-top PC (Windows OS) and PC mouse.
