In cattle, it has been reported that more than half of the embryos produced in the world are derived from in vitro fertilized embryos, and ART plays a crucial role in livestock production.\nIn the first half, I will introduce an overview of embryo transfer, which is the main technology of ART, and recent research topics.\nIn the second half, I will introduce the in vitro maturation, which is the basic technology of ART, and the research trends in the world, including the research we have conducted.\n","expected_learning":"First half\nUnderstanding from fertilization of mammals to pregnancy recognition\nCan consider novel livestock production technology that makes full use of ART\nSecond half\nUnderstanding mechanism of oocyte maturation\nCan consider how to apply basic knowledge about oocyte maturation\n","course_schedule":"First half \"Basics and applications of embryo transplantation\"\n1.
