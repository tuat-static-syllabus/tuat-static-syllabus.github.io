These chemicals have caused considerable negative impacts on agricultural soils since their introduction. It is today’s aim to reduce the use of chemicals and switch to biological based method for pest control purposes, i.e., create a natural and organic agricultural system. I proposed the hypothesis of a wide range of symbiotic fungi that occur naturally and have the potential to control environmental stress in their host plants. In this lecture, I will first explain the interaction between host plants and symbiotic fungi in detail. Subsequently, the role of symbiotic fungi in situ needs to be explained to ensure to my hypothesis.\nThis special lecture is a lecture subject to learn the latest knowledge and technology in agriculture and to acquire a high degree of specialized ability in the field of environmental microbial conservation. In addition, classes will be conducted in active learning (AL) including discussion type.\n","expected_learning":"In the field of environmental microbial conservation, which is a specialized field of agriculture, you can understand a high degree of specialization especially in the symbiotic relationship between fungi and plants.\nTaking advantage of the characteristics of agriculture as an applied comprehensive science, you can flexibly consider issues related to a new crop production system based on the symbiotic relationship between fungi and plants from a multifaceted perspective.\n","course_schedule":"1. The discovery of a dark septate endophytic fungus (DSE), which controls soil borne diseases of crops\n2. The behavior of DSE in situ and the colonization mechanisms in host roots\n3. The symbiotic association between plants and DSE fungi\n4. Elucidation of the symbiotic mechanism\n5. Explain the role of DSE fungi in situ\n　For each topic, quizzes and presentation opportunities will be set from the perspective of AL.\n","prerequisites":"In addition to the 7.5 hours of class time and the time required to create reports, the following studies are required. Please refer to the lecture materials and reference books and perform preparations and reviews according to the standard number of hours of the university.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided in class.","assessment":"Class participation attitude 50%: Evaluate attendance and contribution to discussion.\nReport 50%: The point of evaluation is to be able to discuss the effectiveness of countermeasures for given issues.\n","message_from_instructor":"I proposed the hypothesis of a wide range of symbiotic fungi that occur naturally and have the potential to control environmental stress in their host plants. Hopefully, my hypothesis will be accepted widely by students.","course_keywords":"Symbiosis, microorganisms, plants, endophyte, environmental stress tolerance","office_hours":"If you have any questions, please contact the following e-mail address.
