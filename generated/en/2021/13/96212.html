In plant immunity, an example of a defensive response called a hypersensitive response with cell death induction is known. In this lecture, I will first explain the expression manipulation method of foreign genes in plants. Then, I will introduce research examples cocerning about the proliferation mode of plant viruses, the defense response of plants, the search for genes involved in cell death induction, and the induction of cell death by the expression manipulation of foreign genes. Next, I will explain the outline of plant immunity known to date, the molecular mechanism related to pathogen recognition, and research examples of the activation control of plant immunity.\nThis lecture is a lecture subject to acquire a high degree of specialized ability in the field of applied life science by learning the latest knowledge and technology in agriculture.\n","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to understand:\n(1) various methods for artificially expressing foreign genes in plants,\n(2) the outline of defense response to viruses and cell death induction in plants,\n(3) the outline of plant immunity,\n(4) research examples on the genes for the plant-side receptors involved in pathogen recognition and control of plant immunity.\nPlease refer to the curriculum map of the course guide.\n","course_schedule":"(1) Manipulation of artificial expression of foreign genes in plants\n(2) The mode of plant virus proliferation, and plant defense response\n(3) Search and analysis of genes that can induce cell death in plants\n(4) Overview of plant immunity\n(5) Genes of plant-side receptors involved in pathogen recognition\n(6) Control of activation of plant immunity\n","prerequisites":"It is desirable to have completed lectures in the fields of molecular biology and genetic engineering.\nIn addition to class time and time required to create reports, etc., refer to lecture materials and references, and perform preparation and review according to the standard number of hours of the university.\n","texts_and_materials":"The lecture will be given based on the lecture materials posted in the classroom etc.","assessment":"Report (100%)","message_from_instructor":"Please think for yourself how the results of the basic research on plant immunity learned this time should be applied and developed from the viewpoint of increasing food production.","course_keywords":"Plant immunity, defense response, plant virus, cell death, regulation of gene expression","office_hours":"10:00 ? 17:00（Mon - Fri）（Please contact in advance by e-mail etc.）","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"10/7/2021 2:28:29 PM","name":{"id":1659,"ja":"先端生命科学特論","en":"Advanced Life Science"},"instructor":{"id":1479,"ja":"松下 保彦","en":"MATSUSHITA Yasuhiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Frontiers in Plant Science 5,307 (2014)\nNature 486, 228-233 (2012)\nPlant Journal 31,341-353 (2002)\nPlant Journal 36,421-429 (2003)\nPlant Journal 43,491-505 (2005)\nPlant Journal 73,357-367 (2012)\nPlant Journal 89,671-680 (2017)\nPlant Journal 93,592-613 (2018)\nPlant Physiology 175,498-510 (2017)\n\n\n(in Japanese)\nウイルス　Vol.65, No.2, 199-208 (2015)\n植物の成長調節　Vol.53, No.1, 43-52 (2018)\nDr.岩田の植物防御機構講座\n　（https://www.meiji-seika-pharma.co.jp/oryze/dr-iwata/）\n"}}
