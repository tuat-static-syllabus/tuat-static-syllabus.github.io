The study area also aiming at the planning of forest roads and forest road networks. It consists of forestry machinery, forestry operation system, ergonomics, and forestry civil engineering and uses a variety of study methods.\n● In this class, outlines of forestry and a life cycle of logs in Japan will be given at first, and then, an overview of forest engineering will be given. Then, modern researches will be introduced. Furthermore, two popular study methods; vibration analysis and LCA in forestry.\n● This course is a lecture course designed to develop advanced professional skills in the field of symbiotic science of environment and natural resources by learning the latest knowledge and technologies in agricultural science.\n● In the class, videos taken in the field and old photographs are used to help students with different fields of specialization to visualize the field.","expected_learning":"● Students can explain outlines of forestry in Japan.\n● Students can explain the overview of forest engineering in Japan.\n● Students can explain the meaning of vibration analysis.\n● Students can explain the concept and methods of LCA.\n● Please refer to the curriculum map in the course guide.\n\n\n","course_schedule":"● Forest engineering\n● Forestry in Japan\n● Tools and machines used in forestry\n● Vibration analysis in the forestry field\n● LCA on the forestry production system\n● The content of the class may be modified according to the progress of the class.","prerequisites":"● In addition to the 7.5 hours of class time and the time required to prepare reports and others, students are required to refer to the lecture materials and reference books distributed to them, and to prepare and review according to the standard number of hours at the university.","texts_and_materials":"● The texts will be supplied on Google classroom","assessment":"● 30 % for class participation, 70 % for assignment submission","message_from_instructor":"I will introduce basic study methods which will be useful for researchers of other fields.","course_keywords":"forestry, forest engineering, forestry machinery, forestry operation, forestry civil engineering, vibration analysis, life cycle assessment","office_hours":"Please contact with mail message.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://web.tuat.ac.jp/~rinkou/ http://jfes.jp/","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/7/2021 2:38:55 PM","name":{"id":2593,"ja":"グローバル特論Ⅴ","en":"Global Special Seminar V"},"instructor":{"id":274,"ja":"岩岡 正博","en":"IWAOKA Masahiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"● Forest Engineering (2020) Asakura Publishing Co., Ltd."}}
