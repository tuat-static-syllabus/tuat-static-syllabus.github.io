The backgrounds of the lecture are environmental science and tree physiological ecology.\n･ This course is launch for getting advanced professional development in the field of Symbiotic Science of Environment and natural Resources with learning novel knowledge and technology in environmental and agricultural sciences\n･ This course is lecture style basically. Several discussions related the topics will be hold during the lecture.\n","expected_learning":"･ After learning this lecture, the students can\n･ understand the ecophysiological responses of trees to ozone and the risk of ozone impact as an air pollutant decreasing forest health.\n･ discuss the relationship between their own research topic and air pollution and make presentation it.\n･ Corresponding criteria in the Diploma policy: See the curriculum maps of General Information & Course Description\n","course_schedule":"･ Forest trees absorb atmospheric CO2 through the photosynthesis process and therefore mitigate progress of global warming. In addition, healthy forest provides various resources (e.g. timber), supporting the human life. These forest functions (ecological services) would be degraded by tropospheric ozone (an air pollutant), which has increased since the industrial revolution. This lecture will discuss ozone effects on tree species.\n･ The lecture is comprised of following four section. Discussions will be conducted in these sections. Note: the contents may change owing to the progress of the lecture.\n1. Past and current statuses of ozone pollution in Japan\n2. Ecophysiological response of trees to ozone\n(1) Growth response\n(2) Photosynthetic response\n3. Risk assessment of ozone impact on six Japanese forest tree species\n4. Advanced research:\n(1) Free-air ozone fumigation research\n(2) Difference in ozone susceptibility of photosynthesis between upper and lower canopy leaves\n","prerequisites":"Students need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (7.5 hours).","texts_and_materials":"Nothing in particular","assessment":"We will assess based on the performance in lecture (30%) and report (70%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Ozone, tree, photosynthesis, risk assessment, physiological ecology","office_hours":"Question during and after the lecture is always welcome.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"10/7/2021 11:51:31 AM","name":{"id":1676,"ja":"環境植物保全学特論","en":"Advanced Plant Science for Environmental Conservation"},"instructor":{"id":939,"ja":"渡辺 誠","en":"WATANABE Makoto"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":"･ Izuta T.
