Currently, phylogeography and systematics, which are parts of phytogeography, have greatly developed due to the accumulation of DNA information; the development in these fields of study is represented by the radical revision of angiosperm systematics. These development and revision may involve vegetation studies, forest ecology, and genetic breeding. In this lecture, along with several case studies, the pattern of speciation and evolution, inference methods of phylogenetic relationships, geographic genetic structures (spatial patterns of genetic composition and diversity), and formation processes of the structures are explained. Further, the geographical distributions of forest trees and floristic regions in Japan are also explained.","expected_learning":"1.
