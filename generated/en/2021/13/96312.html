Exploitation of renewable biomass energy to substitute it for fossil fuel has been proposed as one of the measures to reduce CO2 emission. This lecture, therefore, introduces research achievements and tactics on clean development mechanism (CDM) plantation, breeding and wood quality of tropical fast-growing trees being planted for CDM, and other effective utilization of wood biomass.\n1) Harvesting techniques and energy utilization of forest biomass: Lecture on the harvesting machines and operational system of forest biomass as well as economic and energy balances of energy utilization of forest biomass in Japan and Europe.\n2) Clean development mechanism (CDM) plantation: Lecture on the tree growth, breeding strategy, wood quality, and utilization of wood from important useful fast-growing trees, such as Acacia, Falcataria, and Eucalyputs spp., and CDM plantation.\n3) Utilization of wood biomass for energy and chemical materials: There are many methods to utilize wood biomass and H2 gas production (fuel cell). In addition, biorefinery is now in progress for converting wood biomass to industrial chemicals. The present lecture explains utilization situations, conversion methods, and technologies for wood biomass conversion in the world.\nThis lecture is to develop an advanced professional ability in the department of symbiotic science of environment and natural resources, through learning the cutting-edge of knowledge and techniques of agricultural science.\n","expected_learning":"In order to promote the sustainable forest management, a better understanding about the forest biomass will be achieved.\nPlease refer to the curriculum map of general information and course description.\n","course_schedule":"This course is composed of the following four themes.\n1. Wood properties and forest biomass in tropical forest\n2. Biological and chemical conversions of forest biomass to energy and useful substances\n3. Utilization and forest work of forest biomass\n4. Radioactive contamination of forest and wood\n5. Utilization of forest biomass resources\n","prerequisites":"Preparation and review for the lectures are required.
