Unsuitable soil includes poor nutrient soils, soils with high salt, and soils contaminated with toxic elements or substances. It is even better to include how the unsuitable conditions were caused in the soils. If you present about the efforts being made in the fields to overcome this, target cases where biological mechanisms such as plants or microorganisms are used instead of fertilization and soil improvement. The presentation will be made in English.\n・ Discuss each other's presentations.\n・ The teacher will give summaries and supplementary explanations.\n\n<Prof. Sato>\n・ Reducing the environmental burden in crop production\n・ Types, characteristics, and issues of environmental burden reduction methods\n・ Case study: Optimizing and minimizing the amount of fertilizer applied by drip fertilization\n・ Case study: Appearance of fungicide-resistant pathogen and alternative protective methods\n","prerequisites":"In addition to the 7.5 hours of class time and the time required to create presentations, reports, prepare and review using the lecture materials and reference books according to the standard number of hours of the university.\n","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided at the lecture.","assessment":"<Prof. Otsu>\n・Attitude toward class (50%) and a presentation (50 %)\n\n<Prof. Sato>\n・Attitude toward class (50%) and a report (50 %)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Plant Nutrition, Toxic elements, Unsuitable soil environments for agriculture, environmental burden, chemical fertilizer, agricultural chemical","office_hours":"Questions will be accepted at the end of the lecture or through google classroom.","remarks_1":"Further information about OHTSU’s lecture will be provided through google classroom.","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/13/2021 5:10:26 PM","name":{"id":2285,"ja":"グローバル特論Ⅰ","en":"Global Special Seminar I"},"instructor":{"id":284,"ja":"大津 直子","en":"OTSU Naoko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"連合農学研究科","category":"","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":"<Prof. Otsu>\nMineral nutrition of higher plants (Academic press)\n"}}
