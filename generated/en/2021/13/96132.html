Many Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacteria require one of the protein secretion systems called type 3 secretion system（T3SS） for their pathogenicity. In this lecture, I will explain the secretion system of plant pathogenic bacteria, focusing on the T3SS.\n","expected_learning":"To understand the T3SS of phytopathogenic bacteria, and its regulation for disease control.\n\nPlease refer to the curriculum map in the course guide for the relationship to the perspectives of the Diploma Policy.\n","course_schedule":"1.Bacterial secretion system\n2.Type 3 secretion system (T3SS)\n3.Regulation of T3SS and plant disease protection\n","prerequisites":"In addition to the 7.5 hours of class time and the time required to prepare reports, etc., students are required to refer to the lecture materials and reference books distributed to them, and to prepare and review according to the standard number of hours at the university.","texts_and_materials":"No textbook will be used.
