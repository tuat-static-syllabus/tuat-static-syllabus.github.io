Interspecific interaction such as competition, predation, and symbiosis often causes evolution of organisms. The term coevolution is used to describe cases where two (or more) species reciprocally affect each other’s evolution. Evolutionary arms race is an evolutionary struggle that develop adaptations and counter-adaptations against each other, resembling an arms race. In this lecture, I will provide a briefing on interaction between species belonged to the different kingdom. Also, I will introduce examples of (1) plants and pollinators and (2) insects and natural enemy microorganism. And finally I will show you the application of research findings on inter-kingdom interaction in the agricultural field.","expected_learning":"1. Understand the basic concept on interspecific interaction.\n2. Understand how the research can be approached through the examples of the published findings.","course_schedule":"1.
