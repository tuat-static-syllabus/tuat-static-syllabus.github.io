The headings have been revised to make it easier to imagine from the perspective of other fields, and information on websites where the latest data can be obtained has been included. Some of the photographs, columns, and exercises at the beginning of the book were replaced or updated with new ones.\nThe recent progress in research on the physics and chemistry of transboundary air pollution has been remarkable, and the contents of this book will continue to be reviewed periodically.\n","remarks_2":"Environmental science is characterized by its broad scope, encompassing not only the natural sciences but also the humanities and social sciences such as ethics and economics. Those of us who study the physics and chemistry of transboundary atmospheric materials (material cycle) should not be indifferent to the historical background of the problem, the international situation, the social trends of each country, and the actual environmental impact.","related_url":"https://researchmap.jp/wlenggoro","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/22/2021 9:36:56 AM","name":{"id":2521,"ja":"環境計測工学","en":"Environmental Measurement Engineering"},"instructor":{"id":515,"ja":"WULED LENGGORO","en":"WULED Lenggoro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"木2","references":"The Physics and Chemistry of Trans-boundary Air Pollution\nAuthor(s): Shin-ichi Fujita, Kazuhiko Miura, Hiroshi Okochi, Hiroshi Hayami, Kazuhide Matsuda, Tatsuya Sakurai.
