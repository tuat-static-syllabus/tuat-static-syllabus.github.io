The format and schedule is dependent on each adviser, and active involvement in the course is very important.","expected_learning":"The standard of the course is to learn how to promote their research in applied chemistry and materials through the training of experimental safety, experimental and instrumental operations, as well as literature survey and presentation/discussion on experimental results.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1) Safety education: It is important for students to get used to safe operations in every experimental work as well as identification of possible risks. Students should be trained so as to do experimental operations with full attention.\n2) Understanding of the purpose, and background of the undergraduate study: It is important for students to understand and explain the aim of the study.\n3) Acquisition of knowledge and techniques needed for the graduation study: Fundamental experimental techniques and operation of scientific instruments should be learned. Apart from basic information in Japanese textbook, most of the advanced information is obtained from English articles and documents. It is a good chance to steady study scientific technical English.","prerequisites":"This course is a compulsory subject.\nIn completing this course, students will spend at least the standard amount of time as specified by the\nUniversity following the adviser's guidance.\nThe standard of eligibility for undergraduate study should be fulfilled.","texts_and_materials":"Please ask each adviser.","assessment":"Evaluation will be comprehensively done on the basis of attitude for learning, presentation, understanding on the research.","message_from_instructor":"Because the undergraduate study is the important course, which requires total combination of studies thus far as well as for understand methodology related to understanding of phenomena in wider and deeper manners, it is desirable to study hard at the laboratory seminars.","course_keywords":"Seminar","office_hours":"Ask the adviser.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/6/2021 1:38:40 PM","name":{"id":868,"ja":"応用分子化学演習","en":"Applied Chemistry Seminar"},"instructor":{"id":597,"ja":"森 啓二","en":"MORI Keiji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":10,"min":4,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"卒研・卒論","references":"Please ask each adviser."}}
