In this course, basic concepts (such as, probability distribution, mean, variance, standard deviation, and random sample) and representative methods of statistical inferences (such as, point estimation, interval estimation, and hypothesis testing) will be learned.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to understand both the basic concepts of mathematical statistics and the methods of point estimation, interval estimation, and hypothesis testing, and\n(2) to be good at simple practical calculations.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps","course_schedule":"1. Basic methods for data collation\n2. Random variable and probability distribution I\n3. Random variable and probability distribution II\n4. Most simple populations and their samples\n5. Estimation I\n6. Hypothesis testing I\n7. Confidence interval\n8.Review, and midterm examination\n9. Normal distribution\n10. Estimation II\n11. Hypothesis testing II\n12. Hypothesis testing III\n13. Tests relating to contingency tables\n14. Linear models and variance analysis\n15.Review, and Term examination\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"稲垣宣生・吉田光雄・山根芳知・地道正行「データ科学の数理　統計学講義」裳華房, 2007年","assessment":"It will be announced in Google Classroom.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Mean, Variance, Normal distribution, Sample, Estimation, Testing","office_hours":"It will be announced in the first lecture.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/24/2021 6:26:50 PM","name":{"id":308,"ja":"数理統計学","en":"Mathematical Statistics"},"instructor":{"id":1972,"ja":"鈴木 良一","en":"SUZUKI Riyouichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Wed.3","references":"尾畑伸明「数理統計学の基礎」共立出版, 2014年"}}
