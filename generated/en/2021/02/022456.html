This course mainly covers classical wet analysis based on chemical reactions. Actually, the modern analysis is dependent mainly on physicochemical instruments, the basis of the analysis is supported by the classical chemical analysis. Firstly, students will learn how to quantitatively treat with various chemical equilibria in aqueous solutions, and subsequently their applications to volumetric and gravimetric analysis. This analytical chemistry course provides students with the chemical foundation toward more specialized chemistry courses such as inorganic chemistry and physical chemistry. Secondly, the students will learn how to use various advanced instruments for practical analysis in research and industrial production followed the understanding of principles of various instrumental analysis methods.","expected_learning":"You understand the basic concept for various analyzing methods using analytic instruments.","course_schedule":"1.
