Goal: By taking both “Chinese for BeginnersⅠ” and “Chinese for BeginnersⅡ” , students will obtain basic Chinese pronunciations and grammars which will enable them to carry out intro-level conversations and apprehend simple contexts in Chinese by using dictionaries. Additionally, students will learn about Chinese culture rooted in the language, hence develop their interests in cross-cultural experience.\nb. Abstract: Though “Chinese for BeginnersⅠ” and “Chinese for BeginnersⅡ” are separated courses, students are strongly encouraged to take both courses because the two are consecutive. In particular, “Chinese for BeginnersⅠ” gives the very basis of learning Chinese, and other courses on Chinese will all be based on this one.\n","expected_learning":"① Acquiring the Chinese phonetic system\n② Able to carry out simple self-introduction and intro-level conversations.\n③ Able to write simple contexts in Chinese\n","course_schedule":"Lesson 9 Auxiliary verbs “打算，想”, experiential expression“過”, numerical complement, selective interrogative\nLesson 9 Body text and exercises\nLesson10 Ditransitive verbs, adverb for ongoing process, suffix“了”,etc.\nLesson10 Body text and exercises\nLesson11 Feasibility compliment, Preposition“給”, Double verbs, etc.\nLesson11 Body text and exercises\nLesson12 Manner complement, result complement, “着” for continuity\nLesson12 Body text and exercises\nLesson13 Direction complement, feasibility complement, existential sentence, expression for\nprohibition\nLesson13 Body text and exercises\nLesson14 Sentence structures of“有点儿／一点儿”,“把”、 expressions for comparison\nLesson14 Body text and exercises\nLesson15 Passive sentence, causative sentence, expression for hypothesis, etc.\nLesson15 Body text and exercises\nFinal exams\n","prerequisites":"To acquire overall skills including reading, writing, entry level conversation in Chinese, students are highly recommended to take all four courses which are「BeginnersⅡ」「Chinese for Intercultural Understanding」(Available for fall semester of first year), 「Intermediate」(Available in second year).","texts_and_materials":"『会話で学ぼう　基礎中国語』　　白帝社","assessment":"Attendance will be taken in every class.
