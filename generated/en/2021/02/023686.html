The nature of this subject was said to be the most important task of Sustainable Energy at the power companies around the world, on energy and demand forecasting. In this lecture all practical experiences including break-through-finding are taken into examples and practices and taught in the classroom. These kinds of actual practices are not mentioned in any textbooks, so the students are eagerly benefited from this session.","expected_learning":"By attending this course, you will be able to learn about the Sustainable Energy and Power Systems, also able to analyze the energy calculation, and Day-to-Day Operation Planning which is generally done by power companies every day.","course_schedule":"The Sustainable Energy which plays an important role in supplying good quality of power (stable and reliable) is regarded as a large-scale system which consists of power generation transmission, substations and distribution equipment. In this course we study and consider problems in entire of this large-scale Sustainable Energy.\nOur aim is to understand the basic characteristics and structure of Sustainable Energy, and study the planning and operation and control of this huge systems.\nThis course consists of the following contents.\n\n(1) Planning and operation of Sustainable Energy\n(2) Sustainable Energy elements and structure\n(3) Characteristics and features of Sustainable Energy\n(4) Mathematical model of Sustainable Energy\n(5) Outline of Sustainable Energy planning, operation, and control\n(6) Economy load dispatching of power generation equipments,\n(7) Active power and frequency control\n(8) Voltage and reactive power control\n(9) Sustainable Energy security and reliability analysis\n(10) Sustainable Energy load forecasting and supply-demand balance planning\n(11) Power deregulation\n(12) Wind power energy\n(13) Application of intelligent methods (such as artificial neural networks) in Sustainable Energy\n(14) Distributed energy resources and micro grid\n(15) Sustainable Energy and environment harmony","prerequisites":"I want you to study some reference books about the optimization techniques and renewable energy resources.","texts_and_materials":"I don't use a textbook for this course.\nI will distribute some documents related to the course before the classes or I will put them on the homepage of my laboratory, so you can download them any time through the internet.","assessment":"【Important, Due to Corona Virus Situation】　In case we had the entire classes of this course as ONLINE Lecture】\nThe method of evaluation: I provide some subjects and you have to submit reports.\n10 marks:　1 report during the course period\n30 marks: intermediate test (report)\n60 marks: final examination (report)\nTotal points: 100 points\nPassing Score: 60 points and above\nGrade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.","message_from_instructor":"I welcome any students from different departments.\nPlease prepare well before class.","course_keywords":"Social development and Sustainable Energy, an environmental problem of Sustainable Energy, power generation technology, deregulation of power industry, energy and demand forecasting","office_hours":"Due to Corona situation, you can send me your question by e-mail, or if you need to talk to me directly, you can make appointment and we can discuss over internet, using ZOOM, etc. (you need to make appointment first).
