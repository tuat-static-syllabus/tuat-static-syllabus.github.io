This class aims to understand the characteristics of electron and ion, and to learn several examples concerned with electrons and their migration. Furthermore, learn about characteristics such as ionic liquids and ion conducting polymers as examples of ion conductive materials. It is important to understand academic development of electrochemistry and relationship between biological reactions and industrial applications of these materials. Deeply understand the life phenomena through this class. Additionally, students are trained to have both scientific aspect and industrial approach on the energy conversion.\nApplied Microbiology: Environmental microbes play an important role in controlling the balance of a given environment. In conjunction to the adaption of these microbes to the designated environment, microbes are known to evolve and attain unique genetic traits. These genetic traits are known as a crucial genetic resource for industry and pharmaceutics. However, a large majority of environmental microbes are uncultivable, hence, making it difficult for us to exploit them. In this course, we will try to understand and learn the techniques and approaches employed to manipulate these important environmental microbes.\n\n","expected_learning":"Applied Bioelectrochemistory: Aims to understand the critical difference between electron and ion, through learning electron transfers and ion transfers seen in biological systems. Aims to understand physical chemistry to confer functions of electron transfer and ion conduction. To have a wide vision to apply the knowledge to propose several applications and design of materials.\nApplied Microbiology: To understand the fundamentals of microbial manipulation and to attain the necessary knowledge and know-how on isolation and cultivation of environmental microbes.\n","course_schedule":"1： Overview of Applied Bioelectrochemistory\n2: Electron and ion: Comparison of characteristics as a carrier of electron.\n3：Electron transfer and ion transfer I: Learn about electron transfer reactions in living organisms, using photosynthesis as a theme.\n4：Electron transfer and ion transfer II: Learn about electron transfer reactions in living organisms, using photosynthesis as a theme.\n5： Self-assembled monolayer I: Learn the importance and formation mechanism of self-assembled layers formed by amphipathic molecules in understanding various biological phenomena.\n6：Self-assembled monolayer II: Learn the importance and formation mechanism of self-assembled layers formed by amphipathic molecules in understanding various biological phenomena.\n7： Bioelectronics: Learn about the design of devices that perform energy conversion, information conversion, etc. using biomolecules.\n8： Fundamental Microbiology I\n9： Fundamental Microbiology II\n10： Current techniques for the isolation and detection of prokaryotes (bacteria, archaea)\n11： Current techniques for the manipulation and detection of eukaryotic microbes (microalgae, fungi etc.)\n12： Recent in vitro approaches for detection, isolation and manipulation of microbes\n13： Recent in vivo approaches for detection, isolation and manipulation of microbes\n14： The future of applied microbiology\n15： Summary of Applied Bioelectrochemistory and Applied Microbiology\n","prerequisites":"Applied Bioelectrochemistory: Physical chemistry, Organic chemistry, Polymer chemistry, Related class: Biophysical chemistry I and II.\nApplied Microbiology: Molecular Biology, Microbiology.

Standard study time set by the our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows: Normal score: 40%, quizzes and assignment test: 60%. Grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive\nApplied Microbiology: Similar to Applied Bioelectrochemistry\n\nEvaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.\n","message_from_instructor":"From Ichikawa: Writing report make you to review the class. To make high original report which has a format needs preparation and sense. Do not copy someone’s report.\nFrom Mori: I hope that you would gain some interest and knowledge on the manipulation or microbes\n","course_keywords":"Applied Bioelectrochemistory: Electrochemistry, Electronic conduction, Information propagation, Bioelectrochemistry, Ionics Applied Microbiology: Molecular Biology, Microbiology, Cell analysis","office_hours":"Ichikawa: After class or from 6 to 7pm on every Thursday.
