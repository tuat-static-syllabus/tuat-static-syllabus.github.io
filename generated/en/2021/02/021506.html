This course provides the fundamental of thermodynamics. The objectives of the course are to understand second law of thermodyanmics, entropy, gas cycle, exergy (effective energy) and maximum work. In this lecture, the goal is not to simply memorize the terms and expressions, but to understand thermodynamic concepts.\n\n*This course is an elective subject of the department curriculum.\n*The class code of Google class room is 3djxvwp.","expected_learning":"You will be able to understand the basic concepts of second laws of thermodynamics, entropy, exergy (effective energy) and maximum work.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Lectures will be given on the following schedule.\n\nLecture 1: Basic concept and significance of learning thermodynamics\nLecture 2: 0th law of thermodynamics and specific heat\nLecture 3: Heat and work\nLecture 4: 1st law of thermodynamics for closed systems and quasi-static processes\nLecture 5: 1st law of thermodynamics for ideal gases\nLecture 6: Thermal efficiency and Carnot cycle\nLecture 7: Summary from basic concept to Carnot cycle and interim examination\nLecture 8: Second law of thermodynamics\nLecture 9: Entropy\nLecture 10: Gas cycle (Otto cycle)\nLecture 11: Gas cycle (Diesel cycle)\nLecture 12: Basic concept of exergy\nLecture 13: Exergy\nLecture 14: Maximum work\nLecture 15: Summary from basic concept to exergy and maximum work and final examination","prerequisites":"Requires knowledge of basic mathematics and physics. This leads to Thermal engineering II, Heat transfer I, Heat transfer II, and Energy transfer engineering. In addition to the number of class hours, refer to textbooks and reference books, and prepare and review according to the standard hours of the university.","texts_and_materials":"The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, JSME Text Series: Thermodynamics, Maruzen","assessment":"Evaluate in the midterm examination (40%) and the final examination (60%). The problem statement of each exam is written in English. Textbooks and notebooks are not allowed for each exam. However, you can bring your own handwritten memos of one A4 sheet (both sides can be written), English-Japanese dictionaries (including electronic dictionaries), and calculators. It also evaluates the contents of your handwritten memos.","message_from_instructor":"Thermodynamics is necessary for understanding subjects in various fields.
