In this course, the notion of a vector space and a linear map between two vector spaces will be introduced. We will learn various basic properties of a basis and the dimension of a vector space, and the image and the kernel of a linear map. We will also learn about an eigenvalue and an eigenvector, for deep understanding of linear algebra.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to understand vector spaces, linear maps, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, inner products and diagonalization, and\n(2) to be capable of performing their practical calculations.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps","course_schedule":"1. Vector spaces\n2. Vector spaces and their subspaces\n3. Linear independence and linear dependence\n4. Maximum of linearly independent vectors\n5. Bases and dimensions of vector spaces\n6.
