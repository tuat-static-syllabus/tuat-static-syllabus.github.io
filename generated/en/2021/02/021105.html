The nature of waves is one of the most fundamental things to understand in physics. Only by understanding the nature of waves can the properties of atoms and molecules that become the basis of chemistry and the many used in biotechnology. To understand measurement technology. In this sense, this lecture is positioned as the basis of all chemistry lectures and lectures related to analysis and measurement technology.
