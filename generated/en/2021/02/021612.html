Data storage and processing in the computer can be understood. In addition, this lecture aims to read and use basic source code of the programming language C generated by others. The basic knowledge of C language, such as file processing, character string, functions and pointers will be lectured. You will obtain knowledge and understanding about C language more reliable by carrying out mid-term exam, exercises in each lecture and final examinations.","expected_learning":"By the end of this course, we expect that\n1.
