That is the ability to design in the broad sense.\nThe purpose of this lecture is to learn the basics of data processing and design procedures through design calculations and statistical methods (concept of variation, correlation, normalization, design of experiments) with regard to the information as a means of creating technical information about the object and conveying them to others, that is, design policy and design shape.\nIn the first half of this course, students will learn the basic rules for design (drafting instructions, shape determination methods, etc.) and outline of machine elements through lectures based on the textbook and accompanying materials. In the second half, students will practice design calculations, use of statistical methods, and preparation of design calculations based on actual examples experienced by the lecturer.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand how to read and draw mechanical drawings, and to be able to design machines based on their own ideas.","course_schedule":"1. Introduction of lecture and fundamentals of drawing\n\n2. Writing of dimension and surface roughness and drawing training\n\n3. Dimensional tolerance and fitting, geometrical tolerance and normal tolerance and drawing training\n\n4. Drawing of screw and gear and drawing training\n\n5. Drawing of bearing, seal and gear, and calculation practice and drawing training\n\n6. Drawing method of pipe, spring, and calculation practice and drawing training\n\n7. Material notation, processing method, multi-variable analytical theory (correlation, normalization, performance approximation, etc.)\n\n8. Introduction to Design of Experiments\n\n9. What is design? / Performance design of centrifugal fan\n\n10. Centrifugal fan design\n\n11. Same as above　\n\n12. Same as above\n\n13. Same as above\n\n14. Same as above\n\n15. Report of design calculation","prerequisites":"Students should do the preparation and review according to the standard number of hours at the university referring to the accompanying materials and textbooks.","texts_and_materials":"* Lecture materials and handouts prepared by the instructor\n* Required tools: drafting tools, calculator, class notebook\n* Textbooks on mechanics of materials, etc. as needed","assessment":"* The lecturer will evaluate the grade based on the content of the design calculations. (Exercises must be submitted each time, but they will not be graded.)\n* Students who do not attend at least 2/3 of the lectures will not be evaluated. (Attendance at all lectures is required.)\n* In case of health problems, etc., prior application is required (In case of absence, submission of assignments (exercises, etc.) is required.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"Class code: 7vecxte","remarks_2":"","related_url":"Invitation link: https://classroom.google.com/c/Mzg5MzA5ODU0MjA5?cjc=7vecxte","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/15/2021 12:52:31 AM","name":{"id":803,"ja":"機械システム設計製図","en":"Mechanical Systems Design and Drawing"},"instructor":{"id":2287,"ja":"石灰 伸好, 関本 諭志","en":"ISHIBAI Nobuyoshi, SEKIMOTO Satoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"工学府","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"月3～4","references":"\"Useful mechanical drawing\" by Hirotsugu Hayashi, Asakura Bookstore Co., Ltd.\n(‘役に立つ機械製図’　林　洋次編著　　朝倉書店)"}}
