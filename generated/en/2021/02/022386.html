In order to understand this lecture, knowledge of various carbonyl compounds such as amides, esters and aldehydes, and knowledge of amines and phosphoric acids is required comprehensively. To prepare and review the next/last lecture are strongly desired.\nThis subject will be explained in a lecture format using PowerPoint. In addition, supplementary prints will be distributed in each lecture.\nThis subject is classified into \"Specialized Subjects III\", which is a specialized subject of the Department, and is an Organic Chemistry subject recommended by the Department.\nclass code：g3nj7iz","expected_learning":"1. To understand properties, reactions and synthetic methods of amines.\n2.
