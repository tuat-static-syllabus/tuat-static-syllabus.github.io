However, no tool or instrument is error-free. In this course, students will learn basics of instrumentation engineering. The focus will be placed on treatment of errors and least-squares estimation to obtain as much results as possible from erroneous measurements. Recently, operation of medical instruments and apparatus are often automated. Advances in robotics technologies are accelerating this trend. Therefore, students will also learn in this course the basics of control engineering. The focus will be placed on feedback control and state equations.\n\nThis course is one of the specialized courses in the Department of Biomedical Engineering.\n\nGoogle Classroom Class Code: 4gysxvm","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n- Calculate the expected values and variances of the measurements and estimate the measurement errors considering the error propagation.\n- Calculate the least-squares estimates even if the number of equations do not match the number of unknown variables.\n- Understand the basics of feedback control and design PID controller.\n- Estimate the state of the system from the state equations.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Probability distribution of measured values\nWeek 3: Errors in measurements and their propagation\nWeek 4: Basics of least-squares estimation\nWeek 5: Applications of least-squares estimation methods\nWeek 6: Laplace transform\nWeek 7: Feedback control\nWeek 8: Review of the first half and midterm exam\nWeek 9: PID control\nWeek 10: State equations\nWeek 11: Z-transform\nWeek 12: Digital control\nWeek 13: Kalman filters\nWeek 14: Particle filters\nWeek 15: Review of the second half and exam\n","prerequisites":"It is recommended that students take all mathematics courses and electrical/electronic circuits in advance.
