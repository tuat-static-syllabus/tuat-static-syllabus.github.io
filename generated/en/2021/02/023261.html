The purpose of this lecture is to learn the basic principles of various medical measurements and devices so that they will be the basis for developing new medical measurement technologies and devices in the future. The specific contents to be dealt with are medical sensors, transducers, and various medical measuring instruments.\n\n","expected_learning":"To understand the basic configuration and operating principle of typical medical sensors, transducers, and medical measuring instruments.\n\nPlease refer to the curriculum map of the course guide.\n\n\n\n\n","course_schedule":"1. Measurement target, electrode, biomagnetism (1st)\nThink about the information generated by the living body. Next, we will learn the basics of \"electrodes\" that detect electrical biological signals. Finally, learn about biomagnetic measurement.\n2. Sensors / transducers for motion / behavior measurement (2nd)\nIntroduce various sensors and transducers for evaluating human movement / behavior (= movement), and learn the basic principles.\n3. Temperature sensor / transducer (3rd)\nIn addition to temperature measurement for temperature measurement in a daily sense, there are various temperature measurements such as skin temperature measurement as an index of circulation condition, temperature measurement for cancer treatment control, temperature measurement for malignant tumor control, etc. There are various types and methods. Learn about these.\n4 Stoichiometry and various electrodes (4th)\nAn overview of the measurement targets of stoichiometry sensors and transducers. Learn about pH electrodes, ion electrodes, carbon dioxide electrodes, and enzyme electrodes used in electrochemical sensors.\n5. Various stoichiometry sensors (5th)\nLearn about various stoichiometry sensors, including ion-sensitive field-effect transistors, enzyme sensors, and glucose sensors.\n6. Basic configuration of medical measuring equipment and electrocardiograph / heart sound meter (6th)\nCheck the basic configuration of the medical measuring device. In addition, this time, we will learn about electrocardiographs and heart sound meters from among the measuring instruments for physiological function tests.\n7. Electroencephalograph, electromyography, pulse wave meter (7th)\nLearn the basic configuration and functions of electroencephalographs, electromyograms, and pulse wave meters.\n8. Respiratory function measuring device (8th)\nLearn about air flow meters, respiratory resistance meters, spirometers (devices that directly measure ventilation volume), and lung plestimography (a method that measures lung ventilation as changes in lung volume).\n9. Blood oxygen saturation meter, sphygmomanometer (9th)\nLearn the configuration and basic principles of blood oxygen saturation measurement using light. Next, learn typical blood pressure measurement methods.\n10. Tonometer and brain tonometer (10th)\nLearn the structure and principle of basic intraocular pressure measurement and intracranial pressure measurement.\n11. Blood flow meter (10th, 11th, 12th, 13th)\nBlood flow measurement may include measuring the flow velocity or flow rate for a single blood vessel, or measuring the average blood flow per unit tissue volume. here,\n[1] Blood flow measurement in a single blood vessel (a) Ultrasonic blood flow meter, (b) Flow rate measurement by indicator dilution method\n[2] Measurement of tissue blood flow (a) Pretismography (b) Clearance method\nlearn about.\n12. Thermometer (14th)\nWe will give an overview of general matters related to body temperature, take up representative examples of temperature and skin temperature measurement in the deep body, which are often used in clinical practice, and learn mainly the principles and methods.\n13. Summary of the course (15th)\n\nTerm Exam.\n\n\n","prerequisites":"Knowledge of mathematics and physics that have been learned by the end of the university’s first year classes.\n\nStudents are expected to have the standard amount of time to prepare\nfor and review the lecture as specified by the University.\n\n","texts_and_materials":"田村俊世、山越憲一、村上肇「医用機器I」コロナ社","assessment":"Homework assignments and quizzes: About 25%\nReport: About 75%\n\n【Grade evaluation in the case of online class　(The evaluation criteria are subject to change )】\nThe grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, report, and online tests. Standard study time set by the university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows:\nNormal score, quizzes and assignment test: 25%, and report:75%. Grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.\n\n\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"medical measurement, medical instrument, medical sensor","office_hours":"Tuesday 15:00-16:00 (@N1-206A)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/19/2021 9:15:50 PM","name":{"id":2499,"ja":"医用計測・機器","en":"Biomedical measurement and instrument"},"instructor":{"id":543,"ja":"田中 洋介","en":"TANAKA Yosuke"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Tue.4","references":""}}
