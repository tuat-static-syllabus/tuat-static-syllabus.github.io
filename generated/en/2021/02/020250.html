For details, see Google Classroom.\n\nThis course is intended to cultivate a better understanding Japanese Science and Technology among students. We focus on current science and technology issues in Japan. These lectures will not only provide students with an important foundation in science and technology, but also help them develop ideas of their own research. In this semester the development and status of Japanese science and technology is explained through a keyword “Material” which acted as several breakthrough in the innovations in the field of science and technology.\n\nThis course is offered in English as one of the Multidisciplinary Courses of the Global Integrated Studies.","expected_learning":"1. Discuss the science and technology from a global point of view and be able to understand Japan's science and technology level and its tasks.\n2.
