Not only one-way “lectures” but also opportunities for students to present and discuss with their own heads. In addition, 2 to 3 external speakers will be invited to provide related topics.\nThis lecture will be held by a part-time lecturer Yuichi Iwasaki. Dr. Iwasaki has been involved in ecological impact assessments in metal-contaminated rivers receiving mine discharge, more broadly, studied ecological risk assessment and management for chemicals.\n\nGoogle classroom code: wvngiwn","expected_learning":"(1) Understand the human health and ecological risk assessment and management practices of chemical substances\n(2) To acquire a trial and error method to understand daily risks\n\nDiploma Policy Perspective of the Department: Please refer to the curriculum map of the course guide.","course_schedule":"1. Introduction\n2. What is risk assessment? -Try to “stretch” until safety and security\n3. Procedure for human health risk assessment\n4. Example of human health risk: calculating radiation risk\n5.

Human health risk assessment: other examples and summary\n8. Ecological risk assessment Before that!\n9. Ecological risk assessment basics and procedures\n10. Basis of statistical analysis for ecological risk assessment: eh? How do you decide no influence?\n11. Decide the water quality environmental standard for zinc\n12. Zinc regulation and its problems: how to infer real-world effects?\n13. External speaker (planned: Risk of genetically modified plants)\n14. Introduction of lecturers or ecological risk related cases\n15.
