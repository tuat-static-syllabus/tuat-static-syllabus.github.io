However, even if the development method changes, the requirements for design procedures and drawings do not change. Rather, as engineers play an active role globally, the demand for information contained in drawings is becoming stricter.\nThe purpose of this course is to learn the basics of design through practical training such as handwritten drafting and design procedures, and to understand \"manufacturing\". The flow of the lecture is to learn the basics of drafting based on textbooks and materials created by the instructor, and then practice from design specification determination to drawing creation.\n","expected_learning":"You will be able to understand the information required for drawings and be able to perform basic development according to the theme.","course_schedule":"1.　Necessity of drafting, Basics of drawing (~ auxiliary drawing),\n2.　Drawing basics (dimensions ~ normal tolerances), Introduce reference drawing\n3.　Exercises (drawing frame, V block, Retainer, Gauge, Eyebolt, Spanner)\n4.　Exercises (drawing frame, V block, Retainer, Gauge, Eyebolt, Spanner)\n5.　Drawing basics (surface texture ~ surface treatment), Introduce reference drawing\n6.　Development flow, Spring design, Seal design, Exercise (spring design, seal design)\n7.　Shaft design, Bearing design, Gear design, Exercise (gear design)\n8.　Exercises (Steering wheel, Gears, 3D view → Plan view, Plan view → 3D view)\n9.　Exercises (Steering wheel, Gears, 3D view → Plan view, Plan view → 3D view)\n10. Explanation of Drawing exercises, reduction gear design assignment, design concept, create design specification\n11.　Reducer design assignment (design concept, calculate gear specification, calculate bearing selection and life)\n12.　Reducer design assignment (design concept, plan housing)\n13.　Reducer design assignment (planning drawing, plan housing)\n14.　Reducer design assignment (planning drawing)\n15.　Summary of design assignment (design specification, concept drawings, planning drawing, design materials)\n","prerequisites":"・You must have a desk, etc. that can draw A3 size drawings in an environment other than the university drafting room (home, etc.).\n・You must have internet facilities that allow you to take classes online.\n","texts_and_materials":"・ Text: \"Useful Mechanical Drafting\" edited by Hirotsugu Hayashi (Asakura Shoten, in Japanese)\n(林洋二編著　『役に立つ機械製図』　（朝倉書店）)\n・ Handouts created by the instructor\n・ Required tools: Drafting tools(pencil H & HB, set square, compass, drafting tape, etc.), writing utensils, notebooks, calculators (6th and later)\n","assessment":"Exercises and design assignments will be evaluated by submitting them.\nHowever, if you draw a drawing without using a drafting tool, you will be deducted.\nAttendance of 4/5 or more is a prerequisite. (Basically all lectures attended)\nIf you are absent due to poor physical condition, please submit the prescribed documents.\n","message_from_instructor":"I will explain the practical design procedure and drawing while introducing the development work that I have practiced in the company. Also, by drawing the assignment drawing, you will be accustomed to how to read and draw the drawing.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"Class code: mweasfv","remarks_2":"","related_url":"Invitation link: https://classroom.google.com/c/Mzg5MzA5ODU0MTcx?cjc=mweasfv","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/16/2021 9:36:52 PM","name":{"id":803,"ja":"機械システム設計製図","en":"Mechanical Systems Design and Drawing"},"instructor":{"id":2288,"ja":"佐藤 英志, 関本 諭志","en":"SATOU Hideshi, SEKIMOTO Satoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Mon.4～5","references":""}}
