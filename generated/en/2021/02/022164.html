Cell biology is a research field that studies biological phenomena at the cell level. Because all organisms are composed of cells, cell biology is an essential subject to learn specialized foundation of biotechnology, and it is a basic subject of life science. The purpose of this lecture is to learn the interaction between cells in cell biology, the process of multicellular organisms formation, the regeneration, etc., and to understand the basic knowledge of this research field.\n\nThe society of the cell is based on intercellular interactions such as cell binding and extracellular matrix. These interactions leads to the development of multicellular organisms, the regeneration by stem cells after development, and some disease. Students are encouraged to study using data provided in the class to build a systematic understanding on the society of the cell.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand the basic knowledge of this research field.\nThis subject is associated with the corresponding criteria A in the Diploma Policy.","course_schedule":"1.
