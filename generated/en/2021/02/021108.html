This course will reveal the microbiology and its history, because microbiology is the fundamental for the development of modern biology. This course will focus on both the basic microbiology and applied biology. The basic microbiology will mainly contain the introduction of the general classification of microorganism and the experimental methods. The applied microbiology will discuss the role of the microorganisms in the biological and physical cycle in nature, the useful natural compounds from microorganisms, and the microorganism-related diseases.","expected_learning":"By the end of the course, the students should understand and be able to primarily explain the following issues:\n1) history of biology and microbiology\n2) classification of microorganisms\n3) role of the microorganisms in the biological and physical cycle in nature\n4) genetic engineering for microorganisms\n5) useful natural compounds from microorganisms, and the microorganism-related diseases","course_schedule":"Lesson 1/Unit 1/1 Introduction of molecular biology (Basic concepts of biology and microbiology)\nLesson 2/Unit 2/2 History of molecular biology/History of biology and microbiology\nLesson 3/Unit 3/3 History and principle of microscope (bright field, dark field, phase contrast, differential interference, fluorescence, etc.)\nLesson 4/Unit 4/4 Microorganism and virus 1\nLesson 5/Unit 5/5 Microorganism and virus 2\nLesson 6/Unit 6/6 Cell growth and cell cultivation (cell counting, microbiological experiments)\nLesson 7/Unit 7/7 Introduction of evolution\nLesson 8/Unit 8/8 Mid-term examination\nLesson 9/Unit 9/9 Taxonomy 1\nLesson 10/Unit 10/9 Taxonomy 2\nLesson 11/Unit 11/11 Environmental microbiology (microorganisms in biology and physical cycle in nature, distribution of microorganisms)\nLesson 12/Unit 12/12 Modification of microorganisms (Mutation, genetic manipulation, cell fusion)\nLesson 13/Unit 13/13 Useful natural compounds (Food, sugar, amino acid, antibiotic, enzyme, polymer, fuel)\nLesson 14/Unit 14/14 Microbiology and disease\nLesson 15/Unit 15/15 Final examination","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Prints of the course content","assessment":"The students will be evaluated by their performances on the mid-term and final examinations.","message_from_instructor":"By revealing the history and the development of modern biology, especially the microbiology, I expect students can obtain the essential knowledge that will help them to accomplish the cutting edge researches on bioengineering.","course_keywords":"Basic/applied microbiology, taxonomy, genetic engineering, pharmaceutical microbiology, food engineering, infection control, environmental microbiology","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/21/2021 12:11:54 PM","name":{"id":205,"ja":"微生物学","en":"Microbiology"},"instructor":{"id":471,"ja":"田中 剛","en":"TANAKA Tsuyoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"火2","references":"Jacquelyn Black's 6th Edition of Microbiology: Principles and Explorations (John Wiley)"}}
