The nature of life is understood in the framework of material science. Chemistry is a powerful theory to classify systematically a tremendous amount of knowledge on the material world. For the students who are not major in chemistry, the series of lectures show the tyipical topics of chemistry by including a number of physical viewpoints at chemical phenomena.","expected_learning":"We aim to have an ability of thinking chemical phenomena, not just to put chemical terminologies into your memory. So it is indispesible to participate in every class, to listen to the lecture, and to try to understand it.\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1st class. Historical backgrounds of chemistry and physics.\n2nd class. The chemistry of appearance and shope.\n3rd class. The chemistry of color.\n4th class. The origins of elements (elemental systhesis).\n5th class. Atomic structures.\n6th class. Molecular structures and chemical bonds.\n7th class. Atmopheric environments.\n8th class. Phases of materials.\n9th class. The chemistry of water.\n10th class. What is the state of solution?\n11th class. Oxidation and reduction.\n12th class. Chemical analysis.\n13th class. Physics of chemical reaction.\n14th class. Stimulation and transformation in biological systems.\n15th class. What is chemistry?","prerequisites":"Students major in biomedical engineering are requested to have a basic way of thinking of chemistry. All freshmen students in biomedical engineering are welcome.\nStudents are expected to have the standard amount of time to prepare\nfor and review the lecture as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Not specified. Summary of power-point slides presented in a lecture will be provided for every lecture.","assessment":"(1) Examination at the end of semester, (2) a few reports, and (3) short quizzes for every classes. The weight of evaluation of (1)/(2)/(3) is approximately 2/1/1.","message_from_instructor":"Chemistry is systematic theory in collaboration with physics on the material world. Chemistry can offer a way of qualitative, and sometimes quantitative, understanding for physically unsolved phyenomena.","course_keywords":"Chemisty is physics.","office_hours":"Make appointment by Email (ukai3).
