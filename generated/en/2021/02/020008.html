Students will experience different styles of lectures and classes depending on the contents. It consists of two parts.\n\nPart I : Common Introductory Program\nIn this program that is common to all first-year students, students will learn about our university and think how they would pursue their academic life here. The university history and TUAT principals are described as well as our research activities, with the aim of encouraging students to engage in university study and to understanding the importance of designing their individual university life.\n\nPart II : Faculty-Specific Program\nExperiment is a necessary method in science and engineering. As a required subject in the curriculum of biomedical engineering, in this course students will learn fundamental experimental technique including how to use experimental instruments, analyze experimental results, and make a report.","expected_learning":"1) To understand the autonomous learning in the University, and be able to design individual's academic life at University from broad perspectives.\n\n2)\n1. Students will be able to understand the subject of each experiment and perform the experiment properly.\n2. Students will be able to analyze the experimental results which lead to conclusions.\n3. Students will be able to discuss the experimental results in a scientific manner.\n4. Students will be able to make a report summarizing all the above.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n\nCompetency Development：\nInitiative and Autonomy, Leadership and Facilitation, Knowledge Creation, Presentation Skills, Mission-Oriented Research and Problem Solving, Academic Ethics","course_schedule":"Part I : Common Introductory Program\n1.
