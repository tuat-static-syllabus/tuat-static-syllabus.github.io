In particular, we will learn about basic properties and computation of a basis and the dimension of a vector space, the image and kernel of a linear map. We also learn about the concepts and methods of eigen values and eigen spaces, diagonalization, and metric spaces, aiming at better understanding of linear algebra.\n\nHironobu Kihara (a part-time lecturer) will be in charge of this course.","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is:\n1) to understand basic notions of vector spaces, linear maps, linear independence and bases\n2) capable to calculate (bases of) the image and kernel of a linear map given by a matrix\n3) capable to calculate the representation matrix of a linear map with respect to given bases\n4) capable to calculate the eigen values and eigen spaces of a square matrix and determine whether it is diagonalizable\n5) capable to ortho-normalize a given basis of a metric space\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps\n","course_schedule":"1.
