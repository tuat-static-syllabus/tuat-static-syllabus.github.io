Atoms and molecules are not the rigorously smallest particles by the smallest units showing the properties of materials. Due to these reasons we study quantum mechanically the basis of atoms and molecules in order to obtain appropriate image of nano-scale world. In the case of negligible uncertainty of particles involved in chemical raction dynamics, we confirm that classical mechanics can also give appropriate view point of understanding.","expected_learning":"1) To become able to understand atomic internal states and able to explain their properties.\n2) To become able to explain, at least qualitatively, the internal structures of multi-electron atoms.\n3) To become able to explain the origin of chemical bonds and their characteristice difference.\n4) To became able to understand conceptually the interaction between atoms and molecules and the chemical reactions.\n\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"(1st class) Introduction.\n\n(2nd class) Revision of one electron atoms.\n\n(3rd class) Two electron atoms; electron spin and operators.\n\n(4th class) Eigen energies and wave functions of two electron atoms; basic concept and independent particle model.\n\n(5th class) Eigen energies and wave functions of two electron atoms; approximations.\n\n(6th class) Electronic structures of multi-electron atoms.\n\n(7th class) Internal structures of diatomic molecules; electronic coupled equation and Born-Oppenheimer approximation.\n\n(8th class) Potential energy curves of diatomic molecules and the internal motion on them.\n\n(9th class) Electronic states, symmetry properties, and avoided crossing of diatomic molecules.\n\n(10th class) Chemical bond; hydrogen ion.\n\n(11th class) Chemical bond; hydrogen molecules.\n\n(12th class) Electronic structures of more complex diatomic molecules.\n\n(13th class) Inter-atomic/molecular interaction and chemical reactions; cross sections and reaction rate.\n\n(14th class) Inter-atomic/molecular interaction and chemical reactions; motion of potential curves(surfaces) and deflection function.\n\n(15th class) Inter-atomic/molecular interaction and chemical reactions, classical theory of scattering and its cross section.","prerequisites":"Quantum mechanics I and II are assumed to be completed.
