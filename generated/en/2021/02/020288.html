Goal: By taking both “ChineseⅠ” and “ChineseⅡ” , students will obtain basic Chinese pronunciations and grammars which will enable them to carry out intro-level conversations and apprehend simple contexts in Chinese by using dictionaries. Additionally, students will learn about Chinese culture rooted in the language, hence develop their interests in cross-cultural experience.\nb. Abstract: Though “ChineseⅠ” and “ChineseⅡ” are separated courses, students are strongly encouraged to take both courses because the two are consecutive. In particular, “ChineseⅠ” gives the very basis of learning Chinese, and other courses on Chinese will all be based on this one.\n","expected_learning":"① Acquiring the Chinese phonetic system\n② Able to carry out simple self-introduction and intro-level conversations.\n③ Able to write simple contexts in Chinese\n","course_schedule":"1.
