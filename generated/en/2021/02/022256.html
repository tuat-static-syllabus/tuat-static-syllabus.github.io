In this lecture, the goal is to learn the fundamentals of wave phenomena in various physical systems. First, the concept of the reference mode of vibration and the superposition of the modes will be described for a mechanical spring model. Next, we extend to the continuum and explain the introduction of the wave equation, the properties of the waves, and the Fourier transform. In this lecture, classes and exercises will be conducted while introducing the relationship between vibration and wave phenomena and biomedical engineering.","expected_learning":"The achievement criteria are described below.\n(1) To be able to explain the normal mode of vibration, dispersion relation, and wave properties.\n(2) To be able to perform analysis using Fourier series expansion and Fourier transform.\n(3) To be able to explain mechanical waves (sound waves) in a continuum.\n(4) To be able to explain electromagnetic waves (radio waves and light).\n\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Lecture 1: Introduction: wave physics and medical engineering\nLecture 2: Simple vibration and superposition\nLecture 3: Concept of mode I (Coupled vibration)\nLecture 4: Concept of mode II (Beat)\nLecture 5: Dispersion relation (vibration with many degrees of freedom)\nLecture 6: Vibration of the continuum and Fourier series expansion I\nLecture 7: Vibration of the continuum and Fourier series expansion II\nLecture 8: Damping vibration and forced vibration\nLecture 9: Resonance\nLecture 10: What is wave?
