The content is in line with Physical Chemistry I and II, and focuses on the new concepts of enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy, as well as the states and equilibria of various substances, molecular motion, and chemical reaction rates. In the curriculum of the Department of Applied Chemistry, this course is classified as \"Physical Chemistry\" in the \"Basic Subjects\" section. The goal of this course is to solve a wide range of exercises related to items in physical chemistry and to acquire practical academic skills through the process from solution to explanation.\n\n","expected_learning":"You will be able to learn chemistry from the viewpoint of thermodynamics. And you can understand a basic theory of equilibrium thermodynamics such as phase equilibrium with one- and multi-component systems with/without chemical changes and the basis of the electrochemical equilibrium from exercises.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1 : Equation of state for a perfect gas\n2 : Real gas\n3 : The first law of thermodynamics I\n4 : The first law of thermodynamics II\n5 : The second and third law of thermodynamics\n6 : Gibbs and Helmholtz energies\n7 : Summary of the first law of thermodynamics I, II\n8 : Physical transformation of pure substances\n9 : Simple mixtures (thermodynamics of mixtures, the nature of solutions, activities)\n10 : Phase diagrams\n11 : Chemical equilibrium\n12 : Electrochemical equilibrium\n(13 : Molecular motions )\n(14 : Chemical reaction rates )\n15 : Summary of the 8th to 14th lectures\nfinal examination","prerequisites":"It is desirable to attend physical chemistry I and II. In addition to the time in the lecture and for preparation , students are recommended to spend the standard amount of time as specified by the university on self-learning.","texts_and_materials":"Atkins Physical Chemistry, volume 1","assessment":"Exercise points: 10% for submission of exercises.\nUnderstanding of various mathematical formulas and their meanings in each session will be a point of evaluation.\n\n\nFinal exam (in the 15th meeting) 90%.\nStudents will be explained on their ability to explain the First Law of Thermodynamics I and the First Law of Thermodynamics II, and on their understanding of thermodynamic equilibrium theory.\nTo understand phase equilibria and chemical equilibria with chemical changes, and to be able to explain various states thermodynamically will be the evaluation points.\nThe evaluation will be based on the above these information of scores.\n\nScore distribution in 2020\nS:1, A:14, B:11, C:8, D:6 students","message_from_instructor":"This class is practical hands-on training through exercises, and you can further understand the physical chemistry.
