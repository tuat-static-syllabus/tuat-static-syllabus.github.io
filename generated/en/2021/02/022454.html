In this course, we will first introduce basic concepts and terms of statistics such as means, variances, probability distributions, etc. Then, observing the connection between statistical properties of samples and those of the population, we will learn methods of interval estimation and hypothesis testing.\n\nTakashi Yoguchi (a part-time lecturer) will be in charge of this course.","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is to be capable of\n(1) understanding standard terms and notations of mathematical statistics,\n(2) calculating the mean and standard deviation of a given set of numbers,\n(3) applying normal distribution or Student's t-distribution to estimation of the mean of the population,\n(4) testing a statistical hypothesis by using normal distribution.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"Google Classroom will be used for quizzes and assignments in each week.\n\n[Google Classroom Code]\natpttii\n\n\n1.
