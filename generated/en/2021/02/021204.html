These lectures are intended to prepare students for other courses in biology offered by this department. In biological systems, there are different hierarchies of scale: from tiny molecules to small cells and to tissues and organs. Observing organisms at these different scales forms the basis of biology. In this course, the goal is to capture a comprehensive picture of biology through photographs, illustrations, and movies that can help explain each level of the hierarchy.","expected_learning":"You will gain an understanding of the basics of cell biology, genetics, and molecular biology and will be able to explain the details of the course content summarized below.","course_schedule":"Lecture 1: Placement test\n\nLecture 2: Mechanism of viral infection and its relation to the topics covered in this lecture\n\nLecture 3: Cell Structure and Function [To confirm prior knowledge of biology. The structure and function of the cell as the basic unit of life will be explained. To explain the structure and function of biological membranes.\n\nLecture 4: To explain the structure and replication process of DNA, the essence of genes.\n\nLecture 5: Transcription and translation of DNA (To explain the process of producing proteins necessary for life activities from genetic information in DNA. To understand the correspondence between amino acids and base sequences.\n\nLecture 6: Mechanism of virus testing and its relationship to items covered in this lecture\n\nLecture 7: To explain the immunity that protects our body from external invaders.\n\nLecture 8: Mid-term exercise (summary of the first half of the lecture and measurement of the level of achievement)\n\nLecture 9: Energy and Metabolism [Energy conversion in chemical reactions related to life activities and enzymes as catalysts will be explained.\n\nLecture 10: Metabolic pathways of carbohydrates [To explain the metabolism by which cells obtain energy to sustain life.\n\nLecture 11: To explain about somatic cell division, which is the process of accurate transmission of genetic information.\n\nLecture 12: To explain meiosis, the basis of biological diversity.\n\nLecture 13: Mendelian genetics (an overview of Mendelian genetics and its relation to chromosome movement in cell division)\n\nLecture 14: Membrane potential and signal transduction [To explain the mechanism by which the cells that constitute the body of an organism transmit signals in response to stimuli from the environment in vivo.\n\nLecture 15: Comprehensive Exercises [Summarize the entire lecture and measure the level of achievement.\n","prerequisites":"Review homework will be distributed for each lecture. At the beginning of the next lecture, we shall check the student’s comprehension level by giving a quiz related to the previous lecture. Course instructors will provide slide materials for the next lecture so that students can prepare ahead of time.","texts_and_materials":"Life: The Science of Biology\nDavid Sadava, David Hillis, H Heller","assessment":"A review test of the previous lecture will be conducted at the beginning of each lecture.\nOne mid-term and one final exam will be conducted.\nTotal value of quizzes, 60%; mid-term exam, 20%; final-term exam, 20%.","message_from_instructor":"I would like you to understand that the basic method of science is in experimental observation, and not simply memorizing knowledge.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Contact via email.
