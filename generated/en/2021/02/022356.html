This syllabus is subject to change by the faculty member due to lectures.\n\n【Purpose】\nWith regard to the basic programming method, the purpose is to be able to actually create a simple numerical calculation program, and to acquire the basic knowledge of C and C ++ languages mainly used in the field of scientific and technical calculation.\n\n【Overview】\nUnder the Society 5.0 concept, it is important for non-information students to learn and master what programming is. In this lecture, you will learn basic programming techniques in each lecture while creating a simple numerical calculation program. I will skip complicated grammar items and learn only the basic parts necessary for numerical calculations.\n\nThis course is a part of mathematics and information courses classified as specialized basic subjects in the Department of Applied Chemistry.","expected_learning":"(1) Have mastered basic programming techniques\n(2) Able to program using repetition statements and conditional branch statements\n(3) To be able to create an application program in chemistry utilizing the learning knowledge","course_schedule":"Lesson 1: Guidance and basic software operation\nLesson 2: Basic structure, data type classification, input and output of C language programs\nLesson 3: function and simple numerical calculation\nLesson 4: conditional branch statement\nLesson 5: repetition sentence\nLesson 6: array, file, input / output\nLesson 7: Functions and Classes Part 1\nLesson 8: Handling of characters and character strings\nLecture 9: Functions and Classes Part 2\nLesson 10: Application (1) random numbers\nLesson 11: Application (2) differential equation\nLesson 12: Application (3) integration\nLesson 13: \"Programming Exercise\" Part 1\nLesson 14: “Programming Exercise” Part 2\nLesson 15: Summary\nFinal Exam.","prerequisites":"Prepare your own programmable PC.","texts_and_materials":"Prepare the textbook which will be instructed during the first lecture.","assessment":"The grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, report, and online tests. Standard study time set by the our university is required to get the grade.\n\nThe rate of evaluation is as follows: Normal score: 20%, Programming Exercises: 30%, and Final Exam: 50%. Questions are designed to assess the understanding of and the ability to explain and conduct the topics dealt in the lectures.\n\nGrade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.\n\nGrade Distribution (FY 2020): S(24%); A(32%); B(32%); C(11%); D(1%)","message_from_instructor":"The importance of programming in the chemical industry is also increasing, and the interface between computers and chemistry is becoming a very large area, such as the introduction of AI in drug discovery and organic synthesis techniques.
