We will also learn the appropriate use of literature and data resources and the citation methods.\n\n4 Basic thinking steps for finding solutions to problems 1: We will discuss how critical thinking can be applied to recognize a main issue proposed by an argument and to construct a solution based on the supporting facts.\n\n5　 Basic thinking steps for finding solutions to problems 2: Multiple snalytical methods are described so that particular analysis may be selected appropriately and critically evaluated. Data are then used to support the argument to propose a solution.\n\n6　Logical writing 1: We will learn the criteria for writing a logically argument with a clear point and supporting facts.
