In these sessions, you will conduct the experiments about fundamental molecular transformations of organic compounds and the measurements of polymer properties. Students have to write a report after each session. The lab sessions introduce students to the basic techniques used in organic chemistry laboratories and the basic experiments for investigation about polymer structure and properties. The lectures will cover the knowledge about the chemical properties of poisonous and deleterious substances. Moreover, you will learn how to manage hazardous materials, and the relevant laws to develop an understanding of safe experiments and legal compliance.\n\nGoogle Classroom code ike53s2\n","expected_learning":"A large number of organic substances are essential for our daily life. Although some of them can be available from nature, these are largely synthesized by chemical reactions.\nUpon completion of this course, students should engage in safe laboratory practices by handling laboratory glassware, equipment, chemical reagents, and products appropriately through the lab sessions.\nIn the organic chemistry lab sessions, students will also acquire basic synthetic methods for organic compounds and searching skills for chemical and physical properties of reagents, starting materials, and products.\nIn the polymer chemistry lab sessions, students will understand the properties of polymers, which are the indispensable materials of life. Specifically, students will learn about the thermodynamic and optical method for analyzing polymer properties, and the relation between characteristics of polymers and superstructure. Students will also acquire basic knowledge about light including diffraction, refraction, and scattering.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"Experiments for organic synthesis\n(1) Course Guidance: The course preview, the safety lecture, and checking equipment in a storage box using in the lab course.\n(2) Lecture 1: Management of Chemical Reagents and Solvents (Poisonous Materials)\n(3) Reduction: Preparation of benzyl alcohol by the reaction of benzaldehyde with sodium borohydride and its qualitative identification.

You should read the textbook thoroughly to understand the contents of the experiments (15 hours).\nAfter each experiment, you have to write an experiment report and submit within the due date (30 h).\nIn addition to 90 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to perform the above task using the textbook and the references specified below.\nIn completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\nAll students are required to join the Disaster and Accident Insurance for Students (GAKKENSAI).Students may not work in the lab without complete compliance with the safety policy, which will be announced at the course guidance (1st day) in detail.\n","texts_and_materials":"The original textbook ed. by our department for lab courses. Additional handouts will be distributed in the course guidance if necessary.","assessment":"The rate of evaluation is as follows. Standard study time set by our university is required to get the grade.\n\nNormal score (every time), 50%: efforts / participation in experiments, attitudes to learn, completeness of preparations for experiments, proficiency in experimental techniques will be evaluated.\nReports (containing problems related to the experiments, assignment tests), 50%: the status of submission and the completeness of reports (that is correct understanding of experimental contents, accurate reports of experimental results, and appropriate discussion about the results) will be evaluated.\n\nGrade will be given according to the following criteria: S: ≧90 points, A: 90> and ≧80 points, B: 80> and ≧70 points, C: 70> and ≧60 points.\n\nIf you have unexcused absences such as not arriving on time, and late and/or missing reports, you may not receive a passing grade.","message_from_instructor":"We selected the experiments to be performed readily and safely for students unfamiliar with organic laboratory practices. Before each experiment, you should read the textbook thoroughly and understand the procedures and reactions to prevent the accidents, e.g. burns, cuts, fires, and chemical spills. An approved lab coat, safety goggle (or glass), and closed-toe shoes must be worn in the lab. Be careful and keep your eyes safe, especially during the optical measurement using a laser. Never endanger the safety of yourself or all other students.\nDo experiments with positive attitude.\n","course_keywords":"Organic Chemistry, Molecular Transformation, Experimental Procedure, Extraction, Recrystallization, Polymer Materials Science, Phase Transition, Refraction, Diffraction, Scattering of Lights.","office_hours":"A/N; Contact information will be shown in the handout distributed at the course guidance","remarks_1":"1) All reports should be submitted to the report box by the due dates listed in the lab schedule, usually 8:40 AM. 2) Attendance will be taken at 1:00 PM at all laboratory classes.","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/27/2021 9:16:57 AM","name":{"id":2376,"ja":"応用化学実験Ⅱ","en":"Experiments in Applied ChemistryⅡ"},"instructor":{"id":499,"ja":"遠藤 理","en":"ENDO Osamu"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Mon.3～5,Tue.3～5","references":"Reference books are useful for understanding the experiments in this course and for analyzing the data.
