This fundamental study is indispensable for the establishment of modern society. In this course, the goal is to understand the concept of electromagnetics and to obtain the skill to be able to use it. You firstly do them about the interaction between static electric charges and static electric fields, and then do about the time-varying electromagnetic fields. You understand the process to compilation of classical electromagnetic theory, Maxwell’s equations.","expected_learning":"Electromagnetics is difficult, because you have to understand abstract concept of electric and magnetic fields and master using mathematics learned in the University. You are expected to be able to understand the concept of electromagnetics and obtain the skill to be able to use it.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"A pair of seminar and excise is held on every class.\n1. What is “electromagnetics”?, scalar and vector quantity, mathematics used in this course\n2. Electric charges, Coulomb’s law, line of electric force, electric fields\n3. Gauss’s law\n4. Electrostatic potential, potential, energy of static electronic fields\n5. Conductor and static electric fields, condenser\n6. How to estimate static electronic fields, electric dipole moment\n7. Dielectrics, dielectric polarization\n8. Summary and Examination\n9. Current, magnetic fields\n10. Magnetic flux density generated with current\n11. Forces acting on current in magnetic flux density\n12. Electromagnetic induction\n13. Inductance\n14. Maxwell’s equations\n15. Summary and Examination","prerequisites":"You are recommended to prepare for and revise the seminar, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the seminar handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"講談社基礎物理学シリーズ４　電磁気学　横山順一著（講談社）","assessment":"Excises (20%), on-line intermediate examination (40%), on-line final examination (40%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/3/2021 4:12:21 PM","name":{"id":2382,"ja":"電磁気学および演習","en":"Electromagnetics & Exercises"},"instructor":{"id":1980,"ja":"宮地 悟代, 秋澤 淳","en":"MIYAJI Godai, AKISAWA Atsushi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"木2～3","references":"電気磁気学　河野照哉（丸善）\n電磁気学　砂川重信著（岩波書店）\n電磁気学I　長岡洋介（岩波書店）\n電磁気学入門　岡崎誠著（裳華房）\nClassical Electrodynamics J.D.Jackson (John Wiley & Sons, Inc)\nFields and waves in communication electronics S.Ramo, J.R.Whinnery, T.V.Duzer (John Wiley & Sons, Inc)"}}
