You also need to measure the size of your mechanical systems and components with high precision. In almost all fields of science and engineering, you need to do experiments. Advances in science and engineering have been made by advances in measurement systems and signal processing technologies, which in tern enables further advances in measurement systems and signal processing technologies. Today’s science and engineering have been built on the repetition of this cycle. In this course, students will learn basics of instrumentation engineering that are required for doing experiments. The focus is placed on frequency analysis of discrete signals.\n\nThe topics covered in the course include:\n- Random variables, sample mean, and unbiased variance\n- Analog to digital converters\n- Discrete Fourier transform\n\nThis course is one of the specialized courses in M2 course (Robotics, Intelligent Machine Design course).","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n- Calculate the standard deviation expected for the measurements they conduct\n- Understand the working principles of major analog-to-digital converters and select one appropriate to the measurements they conduct.\n- Calculate frequency components contained in the signals measured by using an analog-to-digital converter.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Random variable, probability density function, expected value\nWeek 3: Population and samples, standard deviation, sample mean and population mean\nWeek 4: Sample variance and unbiased variance\nWeek 5: Basics of A/D and D/A converters\nWeek 6: Parallel comparison type A/D converter, successive comparison type A/D converter\nWeek 7: Double integral A/D converter, sampling theorem\nWeek 8: Review of the first half, midterm exam\nWeek 9: Fourier series expansion\nWeek 10: Fourier transform of a continuous signal\nWeek 11: Discrete-time Fourier transform\nWeek 12: Discrete Fourier transform, sampling theorem in the frequency domain\nWeek 13: Various sensors\nWeek 14: Electronic circuits for measurement systems\nWeek 15: Review of the second half, exam\n","prerequisites":"Electronics I and II. In addition to 30 hours of study in the classes, students are recommended to use at least the standard amount of time specified by the University for preparing for and reviewing the lecture contents using the lecture handouts and the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Printed copies of materials will be provided in the course.","assessment":"Assignments (30%), midterm exam (or report) (30%) and end-of-term exam (40%).
