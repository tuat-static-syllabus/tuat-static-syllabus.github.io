The purpose of this lecture is to acquire basic knowledge and basic ideas for application in this field.\n\n[Abstract]\nThis lecture will be conducted online remotely.　The class code = 4s3xu7r\n\nIn this lecture, students will first learn about the relationship between information security and society, and then learn about information security measures and their meanings and necessity. Then, learn the basics of technical components for realizing information security.\n\nIn almost every lecture, comprehension test will be performed on the Web, these comprehension tests are not related to grade evaluation.\n\nSince this field is progressing rapidly, we will use not existing printed materials (books), but lecture materials distributed on the Web.\n","expected_learning":"The students can understand and explain the relationship between information security and society.\nThe students can understand and explain the implementation of information security and its meaning and necessity.\nThe students can understand and explain the basics of technical components for realizing information security.\n","course_schedule":"01 Class Guidance / Internet and Business\n02 Organizations and Information Security (The situation of organizations in the IT society)\n03 Organizations and Information Security (Information Security Policy)\n04 Risk management (risk analysis-1)\n05 Risk management (risk analysis-2)\n06 Risk management (risk treatment)\n07 Information Security Technology (1) (firewall-1)\n08 Information Security Technology (2) (firewall-2)\n09 Information Security Technology (3) (peripheral technology of firewall, server security settings)\n10 Information Security Technology (4)\n(load balancing and redundancy, authentication, password management, etc.)\n11 Information Security Technology (5) (computer virus)\n12 Information Security Technology (6) (encryption and its applications)\n13 Information Security Technology (7) (PKI: Public Key Infrastructure)\n14 Cunning cyber-attack / Explanation of Regular examination via the Web\n15 Summary / Regular examination via the Web\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"The original materials will be distributed via the web.","assessment":"Regular Examination 100% (will be held on web at the final lecture)","message_from_instructor":"I hope that the students will learn about information security in a balanced manner in order to become sensible researchers, engineers, and managers.","course_keywords":"Information security, information assets, threats, vulnerabilities, risks","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"The order and/or the contents of this course including the examinations would be adjusted because of degree of understanding of the students.
