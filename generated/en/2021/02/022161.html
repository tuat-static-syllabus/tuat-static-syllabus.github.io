It is divided into catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism is the set of metabolic pathways that breaks down molecules into smaller units that are either oxidized to release energy or used in other anabolic reactions. Anabolism is the set of metabolic pathways that construct molecules from smaller units. In this lecture, you will manly study anabolism.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1 Apr 13 Introduction\n2 Apr 20 Recent advances in life science 1\n3 Apr 27 The Calvin Cycle\n4 May 11 The Pentose Phosphate Pathway\n5 May 18 Glycogen Metabolism\n6 May 25 Fatty Acid Metabolism\n7 June 1 Protein Turnover 1\n8 June 8 Protein Turnover 2\n9 June 15 Amino Acid Catabolism\n10 June 22 Biosynthesis of Amino Acids\n11 June 29 Recent advances in life science 2\n12 July 6 Recent advances in life science 3\n13 July 13 Biosynthesis of nucleotides\n14 July 20 Biosynthesis of Membrane Lipids and Steroids\n15 July 27 Summary","prerequisites":"\"Basic physics\", \"Basic chemistry\", \"Basic biology\" and \"Biochemistry I\" are prerequisites.","texts_and_materials":"Biochemistry (Stryker)","assessment":"End of term exam: 70%.
