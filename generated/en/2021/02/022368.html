The content is in line with Physical Chemistry I and II, and focuses on the new concepts of enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy, as well as the states and equilibria of various substances, molecular motion, and chemical reaction rates. In the curriculum of the Department of Applied Chemistry, this course is classified as \"Physical Chemistry\" in the \"Basic Subjects for Specialization\" section. The goal of this course is to solve a wide range of exercises related to items in physical chemistry and to acquire practical academic skills through the process from solution to explanation.","expected_learning":"You will be able to learn chemistry from the viewpoint of thermodynamics. And you can understand a basic theory of equilibrium thermodynamics such as phase equilibrium with one- and multi-component systems with/without chemical changes and the basis of the electrochemical equilibrium from exercises.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1 : Equation of state for a perfect gas\n2 : Real gas\n3 : The first law of thermodynamics I\n4 : The first law of thermodynamics II\n5 : The second and third law of thermodynamics\n6 : Gibbs and Helmholtz energies\n7 : Summary of the 1st to 6th lectures\n8 : Physical transformation of pure substances\n9 : Simple mixtures (thermodynamics of mixtures, the nature of solutions, activities)\n10 : Phase diagrams\n11 : Chemical equilibrium\n12 : Electrochemical equilibrium\n13 : Molecular motions\n14 : Chemical reaction rates\n15 : Summary of the 8th to 14th lectures\nfinal examination","prerequisites":"It is desirable to attend physical chemistry I and II.
