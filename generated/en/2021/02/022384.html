Analytical methods for organic compounds include (1) mass spectrometry, (2) infrared spectroscopy, (3) proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and (4) carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which are indispensable means for molecular structure analysis in recent years. In response to the great development of structural and material information analysis technology, in actual research and development after graduation research, ⑤ X-ray crystal structure analysis, ⑥ chromatography, ⑦ thermal analysis, etc. are used. Multifaceted analysis and organization based on material information will be required.In this lecture, by understanding the basic analysis principles of organic compounds and polymer materials and learning practical analysis examples, you will acquire a bird's-eye view of basic analysis and analysis of organic compounds and polymer materials. The lecture will be divided into the first half and the second half. In the first half, you will learn a wide range of subjects such as (1), (2), (5) to (7) spectroscopic analysis, separation analysis, and thermal analysis. In the latter half, as a practical structural analysis of organic compounds, we will rationally identify the structures of various organic molecules based on the spectral analysis that combines (1) to (4), with particular emphasis on (3) proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Develop practical skills. Improve the ability to determine the structure of organic molecules and macromolecules based on the contents learned in Organic Chemistry I to III.\nThis subject is classified into \"specialized subject II\" of \"specialized subject\" in the curriculum of the Department of Applied Chemistry.\nClass code: 4z5bm54","expected_learning":"The students should understand basics of the above mentioned spectroscopic analyses and cultivate practical ability to identify the structure of organic molecules based on rational and integrated analysis of the spectroscopic methods involving (1) mass spectrometry, (2) infrared spectroscopy, (3) proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, (4) carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, (5) X-ray crystal structure analysis, (6) chromatography, and (7) thermal analysis.
