Also, it connects with the all the areas of engineering. In this lecture, we aim to understand the solid-state science, which is affected by the structural changes such as atomic state, molecular state and crystal structure, and by the changes of electronic states.\nFurthermore, in the latter part of lecture, we will study about the semiconductor physics/chemistry for understanding the new function of material by the introduction of quantum effects and so on.\n[Outline] In this lecture, the basic properties of semiconductors will be explained for understanding those properties from the viewpoint of chemical bond as a first step. At the same time, the manufacturing method and principles of \"crystals\" that exhibit the properties of semiconductors will be explained, and gain knowledge about science and technology of crystal growth that sustains the present electronics society. In the second half, the behavior of electrons and holes in the solid will be understood, and semiconductor devices using these properties and new semiconductor devices using the quantum effect will be described.","expected_learning":"(1) Understand the physical properties of semiconductors from the viewpoint of chemical bonding.\n(2) Understand the techniques and principles of semiconductor crystal growth and explain the science and technology that supports the present semiconductor industry.\n(3) Understand how the behavior of electrons and holes in solid semiconductors is related to the operation of semiconductor devices.\n\nPlease refer to the curriculum map in the course guide for the curriculum policy of this course.","course_schedule":"Lecture 1: Guidance and Introduction\nLecture 2: Properties of semiconductors\nLecture 3: Elemental semiconductors and impurity semiconductors\nLecture 4: Electrical properties of semiconductors 1 (energy band structure, properties of electrons and holes)\nLecture 5: Semiconducting Crystal Growth 1\nLecture 6: Electrical properties of semiconductors 2 (density of states and distribution functions, temperature dependence of carriers)\nLecture 7: PN junction and diode\nLecture 8: Summary of the first half\nMid-term exam (content of the 1st to 7th lectures)\nLecture 9: History of Semiconductor Development (Video teaching materials)\nLecture 10: Semiconductor crystal growth 2\nLecture 11: Hall effect and electrical measurement\nLecture 12: Transistor properties and operating principles\nLecture 13: Superlattice structure and electronic state\nLecture 14: New functional device with superlattice structure\nLecture 15: Summary of the latter half of the content\nFinal examination (content of the 9th to 14th lectures)","prerequisites":"The course will proceed assuming that students understand the contents of the lectures on physical chemistry and inorganic chemistry that were opened by the first semester of the third year.\n\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for\nand review the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and\nusing the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Materials will be distributed as needed.
