Students will learn the essential ideas of electrochemistry such as electrolytic double layer, electrode potential, and electrode kinetics, and will be challenged to apply them to electrochemical reactions for batteries and solar cells. During each lecture, much emphasis will be put on solving exercises in textbook, which will help students to deepen understandings of the concept of each chapter.","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Introduction (chapter 0), energy and equilibrium chemistry (chapter 1)\nWeek 3: Standard electrode potential (chapter 2)\nWeek 4: Nernst equation (chapter 3)\nWeek 5: Summary of the first three chapters\nExamines 1 (chapter 0-3)\nWeek 6: Photon electrochemistry; photosynthesis- electrochemical process occurs in nature-(chapter 4 and 5)\nWeek 7: Chemical reaction pathway (chapter 6)\nWeek 8: Electrode reaction pathway (chapter 7)\nWeek 9: What is activation energy (chapter 8)\nWeek 10: Flow of molecules and ions (chapter 9)\nWeek 11: Summary from chapters 4 to 6\nExamines 2 (chapter 4-6)\nWeek 12: Surface electrochemical reaction (chapter 10)\nWeek 13: Summary from chapters 7 to 10\nExamines 3 (chapter 7-10)\n","prerequisites":"Students are strongly recommended to take Physical Chemistry I and II in advance.","texts_and_materials":"「電子移動の化学」-電気化学入門-　渡辺正、中林誠一郎著（日本化学会編/朝倉書店）","assessment":"Total evaluation of mini examinations, Class participation/Degree of contribution/Normal point (approx. 20%), and full examinations (1-3)(approx. 80%).\n2018 S:6%, A:19%, B:31%, C:25%, D:19%\n2019 S:6%, A:24%, B:35%, C:24%, D:12%\n2020 S:3%, A:13%, B:19%, C:31%, D:31%\n","message_from_instructor":"Attendance at every lecture, preparations, and reviews are recommended.","course_keywords":"Energy, electrode potential, diffusion, electrolytic double layer, batteries","office_hours":"After finishing lecture ~ 17:00","remarks_1":"For questions regarding classes, please contact toshi@cc.tuat.ac.jp","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/29/2021 10:26:29 AM","name":{"id":2506,"ja":"エネルギー化学","en":"Energy Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":606,"ja":"渡邊 敏行","en":"WATANABE Toshiyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Fri.2","references":""}}
