In addition, this course aims to understand how to manage electric facilities in the form of various electric related subjects integrated. Specifically, based on the great trend towards the liberalization of electric power and the voluntary security system, we have gained a general understanding and knowledge on electric power system, electric equipment, electric power economy, energy problem, etc., . This subject is also a compulsory subject for acquiring the national qualification of electric chief engineers.\nIn addition, this subject is a class by a teacher who has practical experience. In the class, a teacher who has experience working at an electric power company and has a qualification as Chief Electrical Engineer of Highest grade will give a lecture incorporating the latest circumstances.\n■ Notes\nThis class will be conducted in 5-day intensive lecture (3 frame x 5 days).\nIn addition, this year, this lecture will be an online class according to the university policy.\nClasses will be centered around Google Crassroom, so be sure to check the details by the day before the first lecture (April 17) according to the separately announced lecture schedule. Class code of Google Crassroom: chshaej\n","expected_learning":"１．The student can explain characteristics and problems of the electric energy.\n２．The student can explain an electric power system,
