After their undergraduate study in the 1st semester, better understanding on their work in the 2nd semester will facilitate to consider what to do next by checking their own results. Students learn mainly the following items: 1) Safety education, 2) understanding of the purpose, significance, and background of the undergraduate study, 3) acquisition of knowledge and technique needed for the undergraduate study are important issues in this semester. In addition, students are required to study on their results like 4) interpretation of phenomena and 5) presentation technique which are the representative.","expected_learning":"The standard of the course is to learn how to promote their research in applied chemistry and materials through the training of experimental safety, experimental and instrumental operations, as well as literature survey and presentation/discussion on experimental results. Interpretation of phenomena and more advanced presentation techniques should be also learned along with development of the study.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1) Safety education: This is the season for students when they behave in a safe manner in the laboratory. Because new operations will be sometimes added, it is important to exercise every experiments with full attention.\n2) Understanding of the purpose, significance, and background of the undergraduate study: Students are required to deeply understand about the significance of the undergraduate study on the basis of results obtained by themselves.\n3) Acquisition of knowledge and technique needed for the undergraduate study: Because the amount of requisite knowledge and technique have been increasing along with the progress of the research and they are usually obtained as English articles, it is a good chance to steady study scientific technical English.\n4) Interpretation of phenomena: Because students are able to observe experimental phenomena, the data obtained should be interpreted appropriately. Usually, research is on a novel topics, phenomena encountered should be thoroughly understood and for this purpose, they should study the basics again for obtaining good comprehension about issues at the higher level.\n5) presentation technique: Because of frequent presentation in a laboratory, ability of students is developed on explanation of their own work and they will be directed to fully grasp the content so as to offer appropriate answers to questions.\n","prerequisites":"This course is a compulsory subject.\nIn completing this course, students will spend at least the standard amount of time as specified by the\nUniversity following the adviser's guidance.\nThe standard of eligibility for undergraduate study should be fulfilled.","texts_and_materials":"Please ask each adviser.","assessment":"Evaluation will be comprehensively done on the basis of attitude for learning, presentation, understanding on the research.","message_from_instructor":"Because the undergraduate study is the important course which requires total combination of studies thus far as well as for understand methodology related to understanding of phenomena in wider and deeper manners, it is desirable to study hard at the laboratory seminars.","course_keywords":"Seminar","office_hours":"Ask the adviser.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/29/2021 12:47:25 PM","name":{"id":869,"ja":"先端応用化学演習","en":"Frontier Chemistry Seminar"},"instructor":{"id":834,"ja":"平野 雅文, 森 啓二","en":"HIRANO Masafumi, MORI Keiji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":10,"min":4,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Research","references":"Please ask each adviser."}}
