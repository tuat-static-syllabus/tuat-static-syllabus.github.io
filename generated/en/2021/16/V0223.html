The outline of each theme is as follows.\n(1) Regarding the assembly of classes, based on the learning guidelines and textbooks, based on the learning contents and research areas that have been acquired so far, based on the learning plan necessary to carry out better classes, taking into account the situation at the school site Must be assembled. Learn these points practically.\n(2) In the mock lessons, a group is planned and put into practice so that the lessons can be advanced while presenting \"experiments\" that can only be experienced in science.\n(3) In the mock class, the students who attend the class evaluate the class from the viewpoint of class evaluation, such as preparation, content and development of the class, and explain the points necessary to assemble a better class and points to note in practice. learn.\n","course_schedule":"1: Class construction, learning guidelines and textbooks\n2: Assembling of learning instruction plan, lesson plan, board draft and lesson evaluation\n3: Preparation for Simulation Class A (Observation and Lecture)\n4: Simulation class A (observation and lecture) and evaluation-physics and chemistry\n5: Simulation Class A (Observation and Lecture) and Evaluation-Biology and Earth Science\n6: Reflection and examination of simulation class A (observation and lecture)\n7: Preparation for simulation class B (observation and lecture)\n8: Simulation Class B (Observation and Lecture) and Evaluation-Physics and Chemistry\n9: Simulation Class B (Observation and Lecture) and Evaluation-Biology and Earth Science\n10: Reflection and examination of simulation class B (observation and lecture)\n11: Preparation for simulation class C (observation and lecture)\n12: Simulation Class C (Observation and Lecture) and Evaluation-Physics and Chemistry\n13: Simulation Class C (Observation and Lecture) and Evaluation-Biology and Earth Science\n14: Reflection and examination of simulation class C (observation and lecture)\n15: Summary\n\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Explanation of junior high school teaching guidelines: Science (Latest version)\nExplanation of High School Learning Guideline Science Edition (Latest Version)\nMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Approval Textbook 1st to 3rd year junior high school Science (Must be prepared by the publisher, regardless of publisher)","assessment":"Conduct three mock classes and evaluate the mock classes of other students.\nSubmit the assignment by the deadline.\nJudgment is made comprehensively based on these results.","message_from_instructor":"There are many applicants for teacher licenses nationwide, but very few students actually want to become teachers. On the other hand, teachers have high expectations for any school or school type. For this reason, schools are struggling to find new good teachers.\nExperiencing learning with junior high and high school students will lead to further deepening and expanding your own understanding. In addition, after graduation from university (graduate school), it is a occupation that allows you to continue enjoying the fun, fun, and depth of learning, so you should consider \"teachers\" as one of your future options. hoping.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/25/2021 10:47:09 AM","name":{"id":2014,"ja":"理科教育法Ⅲ","en":"Science Education Ⅲ"},"instructor":{"id":1319,"ja":"林 壮一","en":""},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Teaching Course","category":"teaching profession licensure courses","department":"","semester":"2nd","course_type":"2nd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
