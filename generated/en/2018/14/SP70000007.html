The send half of the class continues with discussion of the environmental fate, chemical analysis, monitoring and modeling for aquatic pollutants.\n","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"Class 1 Class orientation\nClass 2 The aquatic environment --- an overview ---\nClass 3 Environmental hydrology　I\nClass 4 Environmental hydrology　II\nClass 5 Environmental hydrology　III\nClass 6 Basics in water quality\nClass 7 Aquatic pollution\nClass 8 Environmental fate of the pollutant\nClass 9 Review --- Hydrology and water quality\nClass 10 Mid term exam\nClass 11 Water quality monitoring I\nClass 12 Water quality monitoring II\nClass 13 Introduction to water quality modeling\nClass 14 Exposure risk assessment of rice pesticide in rice paddies.\nClass 15 Final examination\n","prerequisites":"Prerequisites：Good oral, listening, writing skills in English is preferred\n","texts_and_materials":"1.
