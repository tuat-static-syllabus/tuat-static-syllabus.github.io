Skeletal muscle plays important roles beyond bodily movement, including modulating metabolic homeostasis in response to environmental changes. Our aim, in this course, is to study the current progress in molecular mechanisms of age-related muscle atrophy, find the problems to be solved, and discuss the solutions for the prevention of sarcopenia.\n\nCentral nervous system is the basis for biological man to be human being. Memory, especially, plays fundamental roles for other higher cognitive functions to determine one’s personality and behaviors. The impairment of memory due to dementia and other diseases influence significantly over life of patients and family. In this advanced seminar, we aim to obtain basic knowledge on neuroscience through the intensive discuss the general neuroscience and particular emphasis on memory mechanisms.","expected_learning":"You can discuss on\n1)What is the mechanisms of muscle atrophy?\n2) How is our motor system maintained?\n3) Discuss on the molecular mechanisms of metabolic homeostasis regulated by muscles.\n\n1) To understand basic terms and definitions in neuroscience\n2) To be familiar with naming of brain areas and their roles\n3) To obtain the structure of nervous cells and the communications between them\n4) To get ideas of intracellular signaling systems to control nervous system\n5) To acquire the memory mechanisms other than mammalians\n\n","course_schedule":"Intensive reading of published papers, reviews, books\nDiscussion on our current research\nPresentation of own research\n","prerequisites":"Students who are interested in Sarcopenia.\nBasic knowledge on the mammalian cell biology.\nPre-acquisition of any one of following subject;\ncell biology, physiology, molecular biology, biochemistry or pharmacology.\n","texts_and_materials":"Published scientific papers and reviews\nMemory (by Eric Kandel)","assessment":"A report on the subject.","message_from_instructor":"Not only Japan, but also other Asian countries including Korea and China, and European countries will soon have the same problems arisen from the super aging society.
