To optimize fitness under fluctuating nutrient availability, body plan is tightly coordinated with nutrient status. This course introduces molecular mechanisms of nutrient responses (especially nitrogen nutrient), body balance regulation via plant hormone (especially cytokinin), and their interaction base on researches on model plant species with a special emphasis on methods and recent advances.\n\n2) Takeshi Yoshizumi\nThis course aims to understand current molecular breeding technologies which confer useful traits in plants. Topics of this course includes plant transformation technologies and genome editing which is one of the current hottest technologies. Additionally, agricultural and industrial applications of genetically modified plants will be explained.\n","expected_learning":"1) Dr. Takatoshi Kiba\n\n2) Dr. Takeshi Yoshizumi\nUnderstand following contents:\n-plant cell cultures\n-gene-transfer technologies for plants\n-advantages of the genome editing\n-agricultural and industrial importance of genetically modified plants","course_schedule":"1) Dr. Takatoshi Kiba\n1.
