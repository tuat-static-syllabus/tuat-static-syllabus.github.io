But in several pathological conditions such as muscular dystrophy and aging, muscle regeneration is impaired and muscle is occupied ectopic fat like marbled beef. Ectopic fat develops from mesenchymal progenitors that are cell type different from satellite cells. In this lecture, features of these stem or progenitor cells are introduced to understand mechanisms of muscle regeneration. In addition, current efforts to establish regenerative medicine for muscle diseases are also introduced. Finally, the lecture covers roles of stem and progenitor cells in aging-related sarcopenia.\n\n【Dr. Shigemot】\nA critical issue in today’s super-aging society in the world is the need to reduce the burden of family care while continuing to make our medical institutions supportive. A rapidly emerging, major health concern is the debilitating effect of muscle weakness and atrophy from aging, termed sarcopenia; however, the molecular basis of this condition is not well understood. Our aim, in this course, is to study the current progress in molecular mechanisms of age-related muscle atrophy, find the problems to be solved, and discuss the solutions for the prevention of sarcopenia.\n","expected_learning":"【Dr. Uezumi】\nTo learn and understand features of stem and progenitor cells in skeletal muscle and their contribution to muscle regeneration and degeneration. This lecture is also expected to be a chance for the students to learn about sarcopenia and roles of stem and progenitor cells in this particular condition.\n\n【Dr. Shigemot】\n1) Learn about Sarcopenia.\n2) Consider the impacts of Sarcopenia for our society.\n\n\n","course_schedule":"【Dr. Uezumi】\nThe content of this lecture is as followed.\n1) Skeletal muscle regeneration and muscle stem cells\n2) Fat infiltration in skeletal muscle and mesenchymal progenitors\n3) Roles of stem and progenitor cells in sarcopenia\n\n【Dr. Shigemot】\n1) What is muscle function?\n2) How is our motor system maintained?\n3) Muscle atrophy and aging.\n4) The mechanisms of sarcopenia.\n5) What do we need to prevent sarcopenia?\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"【Dr. Uezumi】\nSkeletal muscle has the highest level of regenerative potential among all tissues.
