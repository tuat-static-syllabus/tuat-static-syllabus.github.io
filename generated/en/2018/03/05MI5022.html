To understand various indicators of sustainability in biological resource uses,\n2. To understand the issues/problems of organic resource uses though gardening practices,\n3. To discuss various issues on biological resource uses, especially nutrient cycling, in Japan and developing regions.","course_schedule":"1. Course introduction: How to dispose/reuse garbage.\n2. Nutrient cycling and environmental impacts in rural ecosystems\n3. Soils and fertilizers in sustainable agriculture\n4. Use of livestock manure\n5. Compost and Bokashi\n6. Weeds, mulch, and covercrops\n7. Biochar\n8. Pest and disease\n9 to 10. Examples of simple environmental surveys of lowland and upland agroecosystems\n11 to 13. Examples of environmental impacts and sustainable production in developing regions\n14 to 15. Conclusions: Potentials, limitations, and sustainability indicators in organic resource utilization","prerequisites":"This class contains fieldwork. Please prepare for farm works: a field note with a pen, a hat or a cap, drinking water, working shoes in muddy or dusty conditions, and anti-mosquito and anti-sunburn (if you worry).","texts_and_materials":"No textbook is used.
