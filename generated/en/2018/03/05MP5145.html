During several thousand years, the silkworm has been bred in order to get silk thread by human being. Therefore, it cannot survive in the outdoors in spite of Lepidoptera insect. The silkworm which does not require a rearing box to prevent an escape occupies an important position as a laboratory animal / study material. We introduce some studies of the field of development / genetics from the studies of the silkworm to be outstanding in the world. You will get scientific knowledge and deepening of biological interest by understanding the contents.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1.
