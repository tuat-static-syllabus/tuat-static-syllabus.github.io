The hydrology is study to learn a state and a change of the water on the earth from the situation of the water cycle, and the study field includes the land such as a river, wetlands and the groundwater. In addition, atmospheric water vapor movement is important to water cycle, and this has a big influence on the formation of the world division into climatic zones and a climate change. Water cycle is extremely important to understand an ecology.\nStudents will learn the theory and influence of the water cycle in the earth, rainfall infiltration, the outflow of evaporation, transpiration, the rainwater in forest.","expected_learning":"Students understand that the water cycle and heat circulation are closely related to the weather forecast.
