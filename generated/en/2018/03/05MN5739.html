Students will learn organic matter decomposition, mineralization, nutrients dynamics in forest soil, and its function of stream water quality conservation.\nThis course is not only a lecture of advanced forest soils. We will also discuss from students’ presentation of the relationships between forest or natural soil and natural resource and environment conservation.","expected_learning":"Students need to gain knowledge of important function of forest soil in forest ecosystems, and you need to gain ability to teach them to others.","course_schedule":"The example of the lecture is as below. And we will discuss from students’ presentation of the forest soil topics. We will have field trips if students wish.\nOutline of lecture\nOrganic matter decomposition and nutrient dynamics of forest soil (3 classes)\nNitrogen mineralization and the kinetics model of forest soil\nEffects of soil structure on nitrogen mineralization\nRelationships between soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization parameter\nPhosphorus dynamics of forest soil (2 classes)\nPhosphorus formation and availability in soil, Hedly analysis method of phosphorous\nTrees uptake phosphorous and mycorriza, etc.\nSoil solution quality in forest\nRelationships between stream water and soil solution quality\nNitrogen saturation and forest soil ecosystem\nDiscussion of the advanced rule of forest soil in forest ecosystems","prerequisites":"It is hoped that you will take the advanced forest soil I, the advanced forest ecology I and II.","texts_and_materials":"The handouts will be provided. Students need to prepare the resume for his/her presentation.","assessment":"Attendance and submit the question card (20%), presentation and report of forest soil science (60%) and the discussion in the classes or field trip (20%).
