These interactions dynamically change. This course provides students with a variety of interactions between insects and other organisms from the perspective of ecology, biogeography, conservation biology, and environmental economics.\n\nIntensive course\nLiving things are all well-made. Recent advances in biology ? molecular biology in particular ? has revealed the sophisticated and precise mechanism of biological functions that contribute to the survival and reproduction of living organisms. On the other hand, through these strenuous efforts, scrutiny of a single species was found to be insufficient to understand some of the important biological phenomena, wherein interactions between different organisms play important roles. Furthermore, not all the genetic materials in a single organism share a common evolutionary interest and this leads to dynamic changes in biological systems in nature. Here I would like the participants to feel the current trend of research through some of the topics that cannot be explained by the once widely accepted framework.","expected_learning":"Students can develop their own research from a various perspective.\n\nIntensive course\nBe able to enjoy contemplating the essence behind the biological phenomena.","course_schedule":"1.
