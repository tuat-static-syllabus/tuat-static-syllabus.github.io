Meanwhile biotechnology had a progress, but its impact was not so huge comparing these technologies. This was reflected by the difficulty of bioregulation and we should bring forward the technology specialized in bioregulation. In this lecture, I will give commentary on the trend and future vision of bioresearch and bio-related technologies.","expected_learning":"1. Conception about the outline of pioneering technologies related to bioregulation.\n2. Understanding of the importance of the research strategy in industry.\n3. Knowing how to get technological ideas through exercise.\n","course_schedule":"The lecture contents will be modifiable by the reason of the digestion or progression rate.\n1. bioregulation technology\nI will examine why biological control is difficult, and what approach is there to achieve bioregulation. Moreover, I also have an outline on the important \"technology strategy\" for new technology to survive the competition, to become industrialized and to be incorporated into our life.\n2. control of sensory organ\nIt has been said that it is difficult to control visual, auditory, taste, smell, equilibrium sense, etc. belonging to a special sense in our body, but it has been made possible by the progress of recent research. I will talk on the latest topics such as molecules that maintain retinal cells, BMI to visually and hearing impaired, molecular model of taste receptors, discovery of richness and expression of taste receptors in taste-unrelated organs.\n3. exercise 1\nWe will conduct exercises related to product development strategies related to bioregulation technology.\n4. brain and mental control\nThere are more than 100 billion nerve cells in the human brain and they constitute a circuit. Advanced neural activities such as memory and learning as well as emotions and heart are being carried out by information processing by the neural circuit, but it is possible to control with abnormalities of nerve activity caused by various causes by medicine and medical devices. Learn the latest information on the control of nerve activity which can be regarded as terminus ad quem of bioregulation.\n5. Bioregulation technology for Cancer\nOne in three people died by cancer, and one in two people took cancer. In this lecture, Iwill lecture in general on the properties of cancer cells, the mechanism of carcinogenesis, cancer prevention, cancer treatment, and consider the latest strategies to control cancer.\n6. Exercise 2\nWe will conduct exercises related to recalling ideas of products related to biological control.\n7. control of aging, sleep, diabetes\nWe will discuss about recent findings on sleeping disorders, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, which are being studied for new therapeutic target. Medicines that induce natural sleep, drugs that reduce blood sugar by suppressing reuptake of sugar in the kidneys, and attempts to suppress the biosynthesis of denatured proteins accumulated in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients.\n8. Future of Bioscience and Biotechnology Industry\nWith the development of genome engineering, analytical biology so far has transformed into integrated biology, and the industry is shifting paradigm from manufacturing to knowledge industries. In consideration of what factors are accelerating the research rate of biosciences in recent years, in order to bring forth the comfortable future, we will consider how to attend specialty and technology and summarize it .\n","prerequisites":"Nothing especially","texts_and_materials":"Nothing especially","assessment":"Evaluate each task submission and exercise question (100%).
