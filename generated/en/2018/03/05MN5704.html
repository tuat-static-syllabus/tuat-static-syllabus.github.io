The course will guide the students to understand how natural and anthropogenic factors interact with organisms at assemblage level. The topics cover the importance of temporal and spatial replications in community ecology, the differences between empirical and experimental studies, univariate and multivariate analytical techniques, as well as importance of regional and global-scale collaborations for the study of community ecology. Although the course primarily uses insect data, all course materials are applicable to other organisms. The course will be provided primarily in English, though Japanese will be used where necessary to ensure that the student fully understand complex issues and ideas.\nSpecific coverage will include:\n1. Study design (empirical vs experimental study)\n2. Sampling intensity (spatial and temporal replications)\n3. Selection of target organisms (why insects?)\n4. Data collection (sampling techniques)\n5. Data collection (taxonomic, spatial, trait and phylogenetic data)\n6. Data analyses (univariate and multivariate analysis)\n7. Publication and data dissemination\n8. Collaborations with international colleagues\n","expected_learning":"1. Design rigorous ecological surveys and experiments\n2. Understand the statistical power in ecological studies\n3. Basic taxonomic knowledge in invertebrate taxonomy (order and family for some selected groups of insects)\n4. Conduct basic univariate and multivariate analyses using assemblage data\n5. Understand the importance of collaboration and effective communication\n","course_schedule":"June 14-June 15 (each day = 1.5 hours)\nDay1: Development of sound ecological study. Differences between empirical and experimental studies (why experiment studies in ecology?). Importance of spatial and temporal replications. Sample standardization. Statistical power analysis in relation to sampling intensity.\nDay2: Selection of target organisms (why insects). Identification guide to insect orders. Importance of collaboration with local taxonomists.\nDay3: Insect sampling techniques. Data digitization. Various types of ecological data - taxonomic, trait, spatial and phylogenetic data.\nDay4: Data analysis - univariate statistics. Species and sample coverage accumulation curves. Indicator value protocols. Problems with auto-correlation of predictor variables.\nDay5: Data analysis - multivariate statistics. Construction of distance matrices. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling ordination (NMDS). PERMANOVA.\nDay6: Why collaboration? Importance of regional and global-scale collaboration to tackle ecological and conservation problems in ecology.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/16/2018 12:47:57 PM","name":{"id":1016,"ja":"自然環境保全学特別講義Ⅱ","en":"Special Lectures on Environment Conservation II"},"instructor":{"id":1198,"ja":"中村 彰宏, 吉田 智弘","en":"YOSHIDA Tomohiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Field Science Center","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
