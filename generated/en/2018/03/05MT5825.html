In this course, from the physical aspect of the soil, students will learn the various problems related to fate and transport of chemicals in the soil and learn about the knowledge and method necessary for preserving the soil environment. In addition, exercises on simulating mass transport in soils will be exercised by using the water flow and chemical transport simulating program HYDRUS to predict the fate and transport of chemicals.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1: Water flow in the soil\n2: Heat transport in the soil\n3: Chemical transport in in the soil\n4: Basic of numerical analysis\n5: HYDRUS exercise\n6: HYDRUS exercise\n7: HYDRUS exercise","prerequisites":"It is desirable that you take \"Soil physics\" before.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Homework 50%, Final report 50%","message_from_instructor":"Many physical and mathematical expressions will come out, so please consult with the instructor in advance if you are unsure.
