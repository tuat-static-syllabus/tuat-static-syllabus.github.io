In this lecture, I explain that genetic improvement of root system architecture allows us to enhance crop productivity. As an illustration, I introduce gene cloning of root system in rice and its application to genomic-based breeding. Also, to understand how to conduct linkage analysis for gene cloning, practical training is conducted using actual data in this lecture.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"This lecture consists of the following contents.\n1.
