In addition, a habitat fragmented, isolation under the influence of human activities including the urbanization, and it becomes the problem that genetic diversity of the decreasing local populations.\nthe history of adaptation and the evolution, and genetic disturbance and the loss of the variety increase the extinction risk of populations. It becomes important that we should maintain meta population structure. The molecular biological technique is remarkable, and useful to conserve wild life from genetic level. By this lecture, I comment on the basics and the application of the technic using genetic marker. I perform the training of the DNA polymorphism detection.","expected_learning":"To inderstand importance of genetic conservation.\n","course_schedule":"１．Introduction.
