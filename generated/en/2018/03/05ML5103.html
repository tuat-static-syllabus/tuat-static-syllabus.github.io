In this lecture, the pathology and remedy of diabetes are reviewed to students of the faculty of agriculture for the view point of a physician. The possibility that agricultural research may contribute to the treatment of diabetes will be also discussed in the lecture.\n\nPart 2 (Dr. Sasaki)\nIn order to understand the role of carbohydrates in a diverse biological network, it is essential to obtain ‘pure’ carbohydrates to utilize them in the scientific research. However, it is extremely difficult to find pure carbohydrate from the nature by means of molecular chemistry. In one hand, it could be beneficial to obtain carbohydrate of interest by chemical synthesis so understand its physiological role in the nature. The lecture will show you the brief introduction of the current carbohydrate research particularly focusing on sugar chain, and present a few research examples using pure carbohydrate molecules.","expected_learning":"Part 1(Dr. Hosaka)\nThe agricultural research may greatly contribute to the treatment of diabetes, because eating habits of the patients are closely related to the onset and progression of diabetes. This lecture is expected to be a chance for the students to recognize the significance of their studies in agricultural fields for promotion of public health.\n\nPart 2 (Dr. Sasaki)\n①To precisely understand the intracellular role of carbohydrates on the ‘quality control’ of protein. ②To understand the advantage to utilize pure carbohydrates synthesized by chemical reaction.","course_schedule":"Part 1 (Dr. Hosaka)\nThe content of part 1 of this lecture is as followed.\n1) About diabetes: pathology and molecular mechanism of diabetes\n2) About the approach to improve insulin resistance\n3) The role and importance of foods and eating habits in pathology of diabetes\n4) About the significance of carbohydrates in the remedy of diabetes\n5) About the food components to improve hyperglycemia\n\nPart 2 (Dr. Sasaki)\n1) Introduction of the current research in the field of carbohydrates.\n・Mechanism of the ‘quality control’ of proteins\n・Role of sugar chain on the precise folding and refolding of proteins\n2) The latest methods to obtain pure sugar chain by means of synthetic chemistry and its application.\n","prerequisites":"Learners had better complete biochemistry, physiology and molecular biology.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Part 1\nThe submission of the report will be requested. The details of the report will be announced in the lecture.\n\nPart 2\nStudents taking the class are supposed to submit a report (A4 size, ~1 page) regarding the certain assignment as per the lecturer’s instructions within 2 weeks. In addition to the score of the report, the attitude during the whole lecture will be considered for the grade evaluation.","message_from_instructor":"Part 1\nThe research in agricultural fields can greatly contribute to protect people from onset and progression of diabetes. The learners are expected to feel the relationship among different research fields and to recognize the possibilities of their own studies.","course_keywords":"Daibetes, foods, metabolic syndrome, sugar chain, quality control of proteins","office_hours":"Encourage an appointment by e-mail.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"6/24/2018 2:04:25 AM","name":{"id":991,"ja":"応用生命科学特論Ⅲ","en":"Special Lecture on Applied Life Science Ⅲ"},"instructor":{"id":1187,"ja":"佐々木 要, 保坂 利男, 三浦 豊","en":"HOSAKA Toshio, MIURA Yutaka"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"common courses","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Part 1 & Part 2\nTo be announced in the lecture."}}
