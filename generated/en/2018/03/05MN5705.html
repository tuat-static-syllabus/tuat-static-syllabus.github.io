To conserve these plant species we need various knowledge, including surrounding other organisms. This short course focuses on mycorrhizal fungi (soil microbes), which symbiotically colonize on plant roots and determine the growth and survival of the host plants. Students can learn the basics of mycorrhizal symbiosis, some examples of endangered plants and their mycorrhizal symbionts, and practical apprications of mycorrhizal fungi to plant conservation.","expected_learning":"Students can learn\n1. What are \"fungi\", what are \"mycorrhizal fungi\"\n2. Contribution of mycorrhizal fungi to plant growth and survival\n3. Importance of mycorrhizal fungi in plant conservation","course_schedule":"Lecture 1. Introduction to fungi and mycorrhizal fungi\n\nLecture 2. Ecology of mycorrhizal fungi\n\nLecture 3. Endangered trees and their mycorrhizal symbionts\n\nLecture 4. Rare forest floor plants and mycorrhizal networks","prerequisites":"No prior knowledge and pre-learning required.","texts_and_materials":"No textbook specified. Students can download some related articles from the website described below.","assessment":"Learning levels evaluated from questions and comments submitted after each lecture.","message_from_instructor":"Many students do not know most plants live with fungi and depend on them for growth and survival. Knowledge obtained in this short course will provide new insights on plant conservation and potentially enable new mitigation strategies in the era of 6th mass extinction.","course_keywords":"fungi, symbiosis, mycorrhizal fungi, biodiversity, endangered species, plant conservation","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"https://sites.google.com/a/edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/nara_lab/home/publication　(Access to related papers.
