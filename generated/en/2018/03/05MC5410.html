This lecture is opened in Japanese.\n\n“Biosynthesis and molecular evolution of plant hormone gibberellins in land plants”\nPlant growth and development are regulated by plant hormones, low-molecular-weight natural products. This lecture deals with biosynthesis and physiological roles of gibberellins in land plants. Gibberellins, diterpenoid plant hormone, were first discovered as phytotoxins from fungal metabolites. Characteristics of gibberellin biosyntheses in both flowering plants and fungi are introduced in this lecture.\nRecently, whole genomes of non-vascular plants such as Physcomitrella patens and Marchantia polymorpha were determined. Although P. patens is a land plant, it has no gibberellin. How does this moss regulate growth and development without gibberellins? Our research group is studying identification, biosynthesis, physiological function of the proto-gibberellin-type growth regulators in P. patens. Recent progress on these projects will be presented in this lecture.\n","expected_learning":"i) Understanding of the biosynthesis of hormonal natural products at the levels of molecules, enzyme function, and gene expressions.\nii) Becoming scientific discussions on plant growth regulation by plant hormone(s).\n","course_schedule":"i) Introduction of diterpenoid plant hormones.\nii) Biosynthesis of diterpenoids: MEP pathways and diterpene cyclases.\niii) Structure and function of plant hormone biosynthetic enzymes.\niv) Biosynthesis, bioregulation, and functional evolution of gibberellins in land plants.\n\nI will invite a leading researcher on this field and provide a lecture related on the defense system against disease and environmental stresses in plants. Prof. Kazunori Okada will give his talk in my lecture.\n\nYou should look at japanese syllabus in which details are described.","prerequisites":"No. But, you need understanding Japanese (hearing and reading).","texts_and_materials":"No.","assessment":"Discussion and submission of your reports","message_from_instructor":"No.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/23/2018 5:18:51 PM","name":{"id":1840,"ja":"生物制御化学特論","en":"Advanced Chemistry of Pesticides and Bioregulators"},"instructor":{"id":1174,"ja":"川出 洋, 岡田 憲典","en":"KAWAIDE Hiroshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学府","category":"専門分野科目","department":"","semester":"後学期","course_type":"後学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"","day_period":"水2","references":"No."}}
