Memory, especially, plays fundamental roles for other higher cognitive functions to determine one’s personality and behaviors. The impairment of memory due to dementia and other diseases influence significantly over life of patients and family. In this particular research 1 for master course, we will focus on memory neuroscience and carry out the biological experiment on the basic memory mechanisms, the improvement or maintenance of memory which contribute to dementia treatments.","expected_learning":"1) Comprehensive understanding of biological statistics and plan the experiment\n2) Acquisition of basic knowledge and procedures for behavioral, histochemical, and molecular biological method for neuroscience\n3) Carry out and establish the memory assessment using model animals.\n","course_schedule":"Support and guide on the basic study of memory","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"You will learn from the planning to the actual experiments on neuroscience, especially on memory.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"９：００－１７：００","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://www.tmghig.jp/J_TMIG/kenkyu/team/undokiigaku.html　http://www2.tmig.or.jp/Mn_B/English/index.html","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"6/12/2018 12:58:53 PM","name":{"id":1862,"ja":"環境老年学特別研究Ⅱ","en":"Advanced Experiment on Environmental GerontologyⅡ"},"instructor":{"id":1195,"ja":"重本 和宏","en":"SHIGEMOTO Kazuhiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"農学府","category":"論文研究等","department":"","semester":"通年","course_type":"通年","facility_affiliation":"農学府","office":"","day_period":"集中","references":""}}
