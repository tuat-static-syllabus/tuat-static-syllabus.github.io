Many agricultural fields such as applied microbiology, fermentation, natural product chemistry, antibiotics, microbial chemistry etc. occupy an important position for natural drug discovery. I would like to introduce the importance as an integrated field.","expected_learning":"It can be understood as integrated science such as applied microbiology, fermentation, natural product chemistry, microbial genetics etc.\nUnderstanding of the problem drug resistance from the point of view, such as public health and the world economy.\nUnderstand the methodology of natural product discovery and development.\n","course_schedule":"In Japan, there is accumulation of natural product fermentation technology based on brewing, amino acid fermentation. Natural products discovered and developed in Japan have created many medicines used in the world. Natural products occupy an important position as chemotherapy such as infectious diseases and cancer, as medicine for hyperlipidemia and organ transplantation. Regarding antibiotics supporting today's chemotherapy, I will introduce how drug discovery research from microbial hunt to optimization how to create medicine is like. In recent years, the problem of drug resistance has been caught as a major marvel for global public health and the world economy.\n\nAs an example of ongoing efforts of natural drug discovery, I will also introduce development research on antibiotics effective for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.\n<Content >\n1. Introduction-\nDrug Discovery from Natural Products\n2. What are antibiotics\nPosition of antibiotics\nHistory and outline of antibiotic discovery\nDrug resistance\n3. Search for antibiotics\nIsolation and identification of antibiotic-producing bacteria\nScreening\nExtraction and purification of antibiotics\nIdentification\n4. Bioactivity of antibiotics\nAntibacterial spectrum and minimum inhibitory concentration\nMechanism of action of antibiotics\nSelective toxicity and drug resistance\n5.
