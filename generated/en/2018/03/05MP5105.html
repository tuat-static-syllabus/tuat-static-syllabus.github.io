In this lecture, these knowledge is reviewed and explained. Then, the mechanism of cytoplasmic male sterility related with mitochondrial genome is discussed. In addition, the method of plant breeding using the genome editing is explained and the future of this technology will be discussed.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Handouts","assessment":"Attendance (50%) and report (50%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/5/2018 8:07:30 PM","name":{"id":1873,"ja":"生物生産科学フロンティア講義Ⅳ","en":"Special Lectures on Frontier of Biological Production Ⅳ"},"instructor":{"id":1204,"ja":"肥塚 信也, 金勝 一樹","en":"KOIZUKA Nobuya, KANEKATSU Motoki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学府","category":"","department":"","semester":"前学期","course_type":"前学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"","day_period":"集中","references":""}}
