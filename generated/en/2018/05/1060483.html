The timescale signal is not only generated but also compared to world standard time (UTC), and disseminated to society. The method and capability of these activity will be also described. Furthermore, we will introduce highly accurate clocks, namely optical clocks which lose or gain one second in more than 360 million years. To learn the basic of this technology, students will learn that quantum mechanics or Fourier analysis that you learned in the class indeed works in cutting edge research activities. The final day is assigned for a tour to NICT, where you will see a system of JST as well as optical clocks and satellite system to maintain the synchronization of JST to UTC.","expected_learning":"To understand methods to express the phase noise or frequency stability of an oscillator\nTo know how various atomic clocks work.","course_schedule":"1st day\na) Methods to express the capability of oscillator phase\nb) Interaction of atoms and electromagnetic wave\nc) Japan Standard Time\n2nd day\na) Allan standard deviation and phase noise\nb) Spectroscopy of atoms\n3rd day\na) Relation between Allan deviation and phase noise\nb) Optical atomic clock\n4th day\na) Microwave atomic frequency standard\nb) Chip scale atomic clock\n5th day\na) Time and frequency transfer in short and long distances.\nb）Lab tour to the JST system, satellite time and frequency comparison system, and optical clocks","prerequisites":"Knowledge in the basic of quantume mechanics and skill for basic physical mathematics such as Fourier transform","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Attendance 30%, report 30%, examination 40%","message_from_instructor":"While the lecture is extensive for one day (three time bin), we hope students become familiar with time and frequency by positively participating the class.","course_keywords":"Atomic clock, Japan Standard Time, phase noise, frequency stability","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"6/18/2018 6:03:47 PM","name":{"id":1199,"ja":"物理システム特別講義Ⅲ","en":"Advanced Topics in Applied Physics Ⅲ"},"instructor":{"id":1248,"ja":"村山 能宏, 井戸 哲也","en":"MURAYAMA Yoshihiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"common courses","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
