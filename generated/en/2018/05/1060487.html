In 1877, oxygen and nitrogen were liquefied, and in 1898, hydrogen was liquefied, then the challenge to reach absolute zero temperature started. After helium was liquefied in 1908, low-temperature physics was born as one field of the physics and achieved significant progress in the beginning of the 20th century. In this progress, technical developments to approaches absolute zero temperature and discoveries of new physics found at low temperatures were two wheels of a cart. The aim of the lecture is to learn these two sides from basic statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics and also to acquire high-level of understanding for the developments of low-temperature physics.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"Chapter 1 Low-temperature physics (5 weeks)\n1-1 Liquefaction by adiabatic expansion\nliquefaction of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen in the late 19th century, which were called as permanent gas till the mid-19th century,\n1-2 Ideal gas vs real gas\nphenomenological van der Waals equation, particle-particle interaction, liquid vs vapor phases, first- and second-order phase transition\n1-3 Statistical mechanics of the system with particle-particle interaction\n1-4 Liquefaction by the Joule-Thomson effect\nevaporation cooling and dilution refrigerator.\n1-5 Special cooling techniques\nadiabatic demagnetization cooling, laser cooling.\n\nChapter 2 Quantum statistics (6 weeks)\n2-1 Quantization seen by low temperature.\n2-2 Quantum distribution function for boson systems\nQuantization of grid lattice vibration, lattice specific heat, lattice resistivity.\n2-3 Quantization of fermion systems\nQuantization of free electron gas, electronic specific heat, Landau level, quantum Hall effect\n2-4 Band structure and statistical physics of semiconductors\n\nChapter 3 Anomalous quantum phenomena takin place at low temperatures (4 weeks)\n3-1.
