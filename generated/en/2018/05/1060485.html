In the first half of this course, students will learn what is \"principle of least action\". And then students will learn Lagrangian dynamics, which is a consequence of application of principle of least action to Newton dynamics. In the last half, students will learn Hamiltonian dynamics, derived from Lagrangian dynamics and application to quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics.","expected_learning":"1. Students will be able to apply analytical mechanics to various problems in classical mechanics.\n2.
