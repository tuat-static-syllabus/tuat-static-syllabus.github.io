Also, it is necessary to refine the knowledge and skills to be active in science as a human resource in society after graduation.\nTherefore, in this lecture, we reconfirm the fundamentals of experimental technology and basic of researcher ethics. In addition, we learn the fundamentals of project management, industrial engineering and marketing which are necessary knowledge in society. In addition, we will learn the essence of presentation technology and understand the presentation skills that companies need.\n1) Mental attitude to the experiment\n2) Researcher ethics and specific misbehavior\n3) Basic knowledge of project management and industrial engineering\n4) Marketing for science-based people\n5) Foundation of presentation technology and presentation at company\n6) Presentation practice","expected_learning":"1) Understanding of ideas on experiments\n2) Researcher ethics, especially understanding specific misconduct\n3) Understanding the fundamentals of project management, industrial engineering, marketing.\n4) Reflecting the knowledge gained in the lecture on the contents of the presentation","course_schedule":"1)Historical scientific experiments, objectives of experiments, experiment notes, preparation of scientific papers\n2)Researcher ethics, specific misconduct (ivory, falsification, theft), avoidance of plagiarism\n3)Understand the method of plant management.
