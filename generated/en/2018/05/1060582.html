Based on circuit theory, signal processing, basic math that students have already studied in the undergraduate study, the aforementioned applications are explained in details sometimes with underlying theory of signal processing. The goal of this course is to provide students with clear and substantial understanding of how those appliances work. Some problem-solving drills are performed in the class in small groups so that students can experience the practical process of research and development. One thing that may characterize this course is to put a higher priority on extended and practical talks which students may not encounter in textbooks and websites, following the actual classroom interests. Therefore, it may not be guaranteed that all designated subjects have been gone through. If any student has difficulty in the class performed in Japanese, Japanese-English simultaneous interpretation is provided.","expected_learning":"To acquire capability to present his/her opinion and/or questions in the class.","course_schedule":"Speechand Audio Coding (up to MPEG-2 AAC)\nAudio Coding (After MPEG-2 AAC and applications)\nBasics of adaptive signal processing (operation of adaptive filters)\nCoefficient adaptation algorithms (LMS/NLMS/Sign/adaptive stepsize/RLS)\nEcho cancellers/noise cancellers\nNoise suppressors/beamforming\nAuditory system for robots\n","prerequisites":"Circuit theory, signal processing, basic math are desirable subjects, but not prerequisite.","texts_and_materials":"Original documents","assessment":"Contribution to the class is most highly evaluated, i.e. more questions and more comments will and comments make your score higher.","message_from_instructor":"I hope students will obtain substantial and concrete understanding of how the already-studied-theories are contributing to the real products.","course_keywords":"signal processing, speech, audio, robot, cellphone, mobile phone","office_hours":"No office hour is specified.
