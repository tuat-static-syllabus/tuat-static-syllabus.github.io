While reviewing high school-level chemistry, classes will introduce the key principles in chemistry, which involves atomic orbitals, valence bond theory, molecular orbital theory, molecular representations, acids and bases, stereochemistry. A particular emphasis is placed on learning the structures of organic compounds, so that it will serve as an introductory course for Bioorganic Chemistry courses.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1：Orientation\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"The final grade will be based on three components that are weighted as follows: 10% attendance and participation, 10% assignments, 80% final exam.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/3/2018 12:42:52 PM","name":{"id":1165,"ja":"生物有機化学特論","en":"Bio-organic Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":587,"ja":"長澤 和夫, 櫻井 香里","en":"NAGASAWA Kazuo, SAKURAI Kaori"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"courses for master's programs","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Tue.1","references":""}}
