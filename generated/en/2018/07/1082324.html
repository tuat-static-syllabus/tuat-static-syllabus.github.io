Due to population explosion and rapid development of industries in the late 20th century, the necessity of water/wastewater treatment is growing day by day. Throughout this course, students will learn how wastewater treatment plant works and how important biological reactions are to treat wastewaters.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"Learning objectives:\nThe objective of this course is for students to learn:\n1. The major biochemical & physiochemical processes related to contemporary water and wastewater treatment\n2. Functions of these processes\n3. Applications and limitations of these operations\n4. Construction of mathematical models based on biokinetics and interpretation of a simple mathematical model to be able to understand rationales of multiple reactor configurations for wastewater treatment\n5. A configuration of a real wastewater treatment plant\n\nA student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\n1. Understand the history and significance of water and wastewater treatment.\n2. Discuss water quality by taking a look at the constituents and the way to treat these contaminants.\n3. Understand diversified microorganisms with different physiological functions and criteria for them to play a major role for contaminant removal.\n4. Understand the biokinetics and equations of microbial growth and decay under different environmental conditions. nt.\n5. Understand criteria for biological removal of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous from wastewater.\n6. Construct a simple mathematical model for biological wastewater treatment and predict effluent concentrations of organic carbon and nitrogen by a modeling software Aquasim.\n\n\nLecture plans:\nAll lectures are held in English. The first lecture will start on 18th of April. Weekly class-room lectures will normally take place on Friday from 13:00-14:30. MS PowerPoint will be used and the slides are distributed every time.\nThe lectures will cover the contents shown below:\nWeek 1 : General introduction: course objectives, history, and basic strategy of wastewater treatment\nWeek 2 : Wastewater constituents\nWeek 3 : Physical Unit operations: Screening, mixing, separation\nWeek 4: Physical/Chemical Unit operation: Gas transfer, Adsorption, Coagulation, pH control\nWeek 5: Biological unit operation 1: Introduction on ecology, physiology, kinetics and stoichiometry\n-The first report will be provided.\nWeek 6: Biological unit operation 2: Overview of C, N, and P removals\nWeek 7: Biological unit operation 3: Activated sludge\nWeek 8: Biological unit operation 4: Biological nutrient removal/Biofilms\nWeek 9: Simulation 1: Construction of a mechanistic model\nWeek 10: Simulation 2: Simulation-Design of a simple wastewater treatment model\nWeek 11: Simulation 3: Simulation-Design of a two tank activated sludge system model\n-The second report will be provided.\nWeek 12: Wastewater treatment plant visit\n","prerequisites":"Not specifically","texts_and_materials":"Not specifically","assessment":"Evaluation will occur by means of 2 periodic individual assignments.
