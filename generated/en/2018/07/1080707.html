Emphasis is placed on the railway system of selected research fields: Vehicle Dynamics, Tribology, Aerodynamics, and Human Engineering. Lectures will be given by 4 researchers from Railway Technical Research Institute (RTRI) in an omnibus form. A half-day study tour of the research facilities of RTRI will be conducted.","expected_learning":"'- Students will understand the outline of the railway system of selected research fields: Vehicle Dynamics, Tribology, Aerodynamics, and Human Engineering.\n- Students will be able to express their ideas of future railways based on the contents of the lecture.","course_schedule":"'- As for the railway vehicle dynamics, structural and functional features of carbodies and bogies, vibration problems related to ride comfort and running safety will be explained. (3 lectures).\n- In terms of the railway tribology, the main tribological parts composing the railway system will be lectured such as a wheel, a rail, a brake, a pantograph, a catenary and a bearing from a material viewpoint. (4 lectures)\n- Aerodynamics of railway vehicles traveling inside and outside tunnels will be explained (3 lectures).\n- Ergonomic approach (human error prevention and ride comfort evaluation) will be explained (1 lecture).\n- A half-day study tour of the research facilities of RTRI will be conducted (equivalent to 3 lectures).\n- Students will submit a term-paper (1-2 pages in A4) that may include creative ideas for a future railway system in 25 years and will make a 10-20 minute presentation with a question and answer session at the final day of class.\n","prerequisites":"None","texts_and_materials":"No textbook; Printed materials will be provided.","assessment":"Term paper 70%\nPresentation 30%","message_from_instructor":"Welcome to Frontier Mechanical System IV.
