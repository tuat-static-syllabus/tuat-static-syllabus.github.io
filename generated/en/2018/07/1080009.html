The ultimate goal is to prepare students to write reports based on their own research work and to effectively communicate with other researchers and scientists in English. In addition to the topics below, there will also be discussions on global issues to deepen the understanding of students interested in working in a multicultural environment. There will also be discussions on the search for sustainable ways of utilizing global resources to satisfy our energy, food and fiber needs.\n","expected_learning":"At the end of the lecture, students should be able to acquire enough communication skills to enable them to:\n(1) present their research work orally in English.\n(2) participate in seminars, workshops, discussions, and express their opinions and comments in English.\n(3) write reports based on their own research work and to effectively communicate with other researchers and scientists in English.\n(4) write research proposals in English.","course_schedule":"(Course schedule)\nWeek Topics\nWeek 1: Orientation: Explanation of the course content and grading criteria.\nWeek 2: Communicating in multi-cultural/racial societies.\nWeek 3: Scientific journals and writing styles.\nWeek 4: Choosing attractive research titles.\nWeek 5: A brief explanation of the main components of a scientific report (Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusions, References, Acknowledgement).\nWeek 6: Connectors mostly used by native English writers in scientific reports.\nWeek 7: Identifying and correcting errors in scientific reports.\nWeek 8: Writing reports based on “model experiments” ?
