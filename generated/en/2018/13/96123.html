However, recent advancement on\nreproductive technologies in mammals, especially in eutherian mammals, has been drastic as everybody\nknows on TV and in newspaper articles. We would like to introduce the advanced reproductive\ntechnologies in mammals and to discuss the problems of technology and safety.\nThis class is divided into two halves. In the first half, I explain reproductive phenomenon and new\ntechnologies during preimplantation period. In the last half, I have a lecture related with some\nphenomenon and new technologies during implantation and periimplantation period.\nIn the first half of the class: “Reproductive Technology in Mammals”\nAfter the basic knowledge on mammalian reproduction is briefly given, the advanced reproductive\ntechnologies, e.g. in vitro fertilization, embryo transfer, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, nuclear\ntransfer and production of transgenic animals etc., are introduced. Safety and risk of the advanced\nreproductive technologies are also explained because some advanced reproductive technologies are\nusing for treatments of infertile human patients as “Assisted Reproductive Technologies, ART” in the\nworld. Although importance of cytogenetical safety in embryos derived by ART is well recognized,\nevaluation and investigation for risk in the ART are insufficient. It has been reported cytogenetical\nnormality in mammalian embryos, including humans, produced by various advanced reproductive\ntechniques.\nIn the last half of the class: “Successful Implantation and Pregnancy”\nImplantation involves an intricate discourse between the embryo and uterus, and is a gateway to\nfurther embryonic development. Synchronizing embryonic development until the blastocyst stage with\nthe uterine differentiation that takes place to produce the receptive state is crucial to successful\nimplantation and therefore to pregnancy outcome. Although implantation involves the interplay of\nnumerous signaling molecules, the hierarchical instructions that coordinate the embryo?uterine dialogue\nare not well understood. This lecture highlights our knowledge about the molecular development of\npreimplantation, implantation, and the future challenges of the field. A better understanding of\nperiimplantation biology could alleviate female infertility and help to develop novel contraceptives.","expected_learning":"In the first half of the class:\n“Reproductive Technology in Mammals”\n1.
