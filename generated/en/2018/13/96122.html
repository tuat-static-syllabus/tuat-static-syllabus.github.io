The metabolic disease, such as ascites and fat liver, has been accompanied by fat deposition. According to these aspects, I have studied the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism in chickens for the production of high quality meat with less fat, i.e. (1) Effective manipulation of fatness chickens, (2) Characterization of cholesterol metabolism in chickens, (3) Development of chicken oocyte ?the production of designer eggs-, and (4) Identification of regulatory molecule in chicken species-specific glucose metabolism.\nThis lecture introduces our previous studies on molecular nutrition in farm animals and will discuss the further studies for animal productions.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Report within class","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/27/2018 3:21:22 PM","name":{"id":1647,"ja":"動物栄養飼料学特論","en":"Advanced Animal Nutrition and Feed Science"},"instructor":{"id":119,"ja":"佐藤 幹","en":"SATO Kan"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
