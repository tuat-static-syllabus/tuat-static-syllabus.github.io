Molecular mechanisms of gene regulation and defense against viruses and transposons by RNA silencing (small RNAs) in plants will be discussed.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding of the molecular mechanism of RNA silencing in plants. Understanding how plants defense against viruses by RNA silencing.","course_schedule":"1) Discoveries of PTGS and RNAi: Discoveries of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) from plants in 1990 and RNA interference (RNAi) from animals in 1998 will be lectured. 　\n2) Defense against virus infection by RNA silencing: RNA silencing (RNA interference) functions as a defense mechanism against viruses, but most plant viruses contain a suppressor protein against host RNA silencing. Interaction between host defense mechanisms (RNA silencing) and virus suppressor proteins will be lectured.\n3) Suppression of movement of transposons by DNA methylation: Transposons can move within a host genome to induce a serious mutation. Host plants have a mechanism to suppress the mobility of transposons by RNA silencing. Mechanisms of DNA methylation by small RNAs (siRNAs) will be lectured.\n4) Small RNAs (micro RNAs, miRNAs) that regulate gene expression: Micro RNAs (miRNAs) regulate expressions of important genes, such as genes encoding transcription factors. Regulation mechanisms of gene expression by miRNAs will be lectured.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"RNA silencing (RNA interference) mechanisms in plants, especially defense mechanisms against viruses and gene regulation mechanisms by small RNAs, will be discussed.","course_keywords":"RNA, RNA interference, virus","office_hours":"8:30 - 17:00","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://www.tuat.ac.jp/~mcb/","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"3/20/2018 5:50:09 PM","name":{"id":1654,"ja":"植物制御科学特論","en":"Advanced Plant Regulation Science"},"instructor":{"id":144,"ja":"福原 敏行","en":"FUKUHARA Toshiyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"8-212","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
