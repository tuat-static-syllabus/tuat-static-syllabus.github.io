In addition, topics on new plant breeding techniques (NBT) such as\ngenome editing are introduced.\nIn the last part of this lecture, we will discuss on public acceptance of GM plants.","expected_learning":"Understanding of the typical plant genetic engineering techniques (e.g. transformation methods and\ncontrol of gene expression) and examples of promising GM crops).
