Flow regime change in addition to the effect of past gathering of gravel in floodplain promoted enhancement of difference in height between upper floodplain and lower floodplain and accumulation of fine sediment in upper floodplain.\nCondition of river natural environment has considerably declined by the changes of disturbance regime and thick growth of alien species.\nBecause of these condition and needs for recovery of nature quality, many restoration projects of riparian habitats have been operated elsewhere.\nThis course, I will give an overview of the current status of the natural environment of the rivers in Japan and will introduce current topics and examples of restoration efforts which have been carried out in various riparian habitats.\n","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"26th December 2018\nMorning\n\n1.
