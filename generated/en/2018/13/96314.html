The products obtained (including food, fuel, wood and compost) help safeguard the community life, but without degrading the land, water or other resources.\nProtecting biodiversity entails not only preserving pristine environments, such as wilderness, but also conserving human-influenced natural environments, such as farmlands and secondary forest, that people have developed and maintained sustainably over a long time. But these Satoyama landscapes ? and the sustainable practices and knowledge they represent- are increasingly threatened in many parts of the world, due for example, to urbanisation, industrialisation, and rapid rural population increase and decrease (Satoyama Initiative 2010) .\nThis course will teach the outline of forest management in Kanto satoyama area, and we will discuss the biogeochemical cycles of satoyama. In this course we will have out-door lecture in the park where the conservation of Satoyama landscape is conducted.","expected_learning":"Understanding of Satoyama nature and its sustainable management","course_schedule":"This course will teach the outline of forest management in Kanto satoyama area, and we will discuss the biogeochemical cycles of satoyama.
