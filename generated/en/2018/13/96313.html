In this lecture, I will introduce the mechanisms of the expression of properties of woody biomass.\nWoody biomass is the bio-material that is produced by woody plants. Therefore, life phenomena of woody plants, such as cell differentiation and cell death, affect properties of woody biomass. In this lecture, I will introduce outlines including the latest information of cell differentiation and cell death of xylem cells because woody biomass consists of secondary xylem cells that are derived from vascular cambium. In addition, I will explain about details of heartwood formation that is a unique phenomenon of woody plants.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding the outlines of cell differentiation and death of xylem cells.
