Despite water is surely a genuine inorganic compound, we often ignore or overlook it since it is a ubiquitous liquid in our daily life. In addition, water in the soil functions differently from that existing aboveground, which is often difficult to recognize by visual observation. Water is also a raw material of photosynthesis, implying that the properties and functions of soil water are the chief factor controlling the growth of crops.\nThis lecture explains the physiochemical properties of soil water, and their relations to soil microorganisms and the growth of crops. With these backgrounds, methods of water management that are most suitable for crop production will be discussed.\n","expected_learning":"This lecture is designed to review the basics on the physiochemical properties of soil, and the methods for determining properties and activities of soil water. Students are expected to understand the physiochemical properties and functions of soil water and their effects on soil microorganisms in order to find the methods of water management that are most suitable for crop production.","course_schedule":"１） Physical property of soil water、soil water potential\nEffects soil water on soil microorganisms and plant growth\n２） Soil atmosphere and its influences on soil environment\n　　Effects soil atmosphere on soil microorganisms and plant growth\n３） Chemical property of soil water and its effects on soil microorganisms and plant growth","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Handouts (lecture notes) will be provided in each class.","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"As mentioned above, water is truly a genuine inorganic compound. With this viewpoint, it becomes easier to understand the properties of soil water. In a sense, this lecture is a review of water. Through the lecture, students are expected to gain solid knowledge on soil water and use the knowledge in their future research or study.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/28/2018 1:56:39 PM","name":{"id":1643,"ja":"植物生産環境学特論","en":"Advanced Agro-environment Science"},"instructor":{"id":1299,"ja":"福井 糧（宇）","en":"FUKUI Ryo"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"United Graduate School Agricultural Science","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"To be announced in the lecture."}}
