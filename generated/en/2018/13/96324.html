These chemicals have caused considerable negative impacts on agricultural\nsoils since their introduction. It is today’s aim to reduce the use of chemicals and switch to biological\nbased method for pest control purposes, i.e., create a natural and organic agricultural system. I\nproposed the hypothesis of a wide range of symbiotic fungi that occur naturally and have the potential to\ncontrol environmental stress in their host plants. In this lecture, I will first explain the interaction\nbetween host plants and symbiotic fungi in detail. Subsequently, the role of symbiotic fungi in situ needs to be explained to ensure to my hypothesis.","expected_learning":"The understanding of the symbiotic relationship of the fungi and plant.\nThe considering the new crop production system based on this symbiotic relationship.","course_schedule":"1.
