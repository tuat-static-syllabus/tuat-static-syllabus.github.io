Researches on proteomics and metabolomics are actively being carried out through the world as post-genomics researches, and they are remarkably under development in medical and pharmaceutical fields. In contrast, these researches on plants are rather undeveloped, especially those on trees are much less developed. However, these researches on trees are steadily undergoing mostly in tree pathology.\n3. This lecture deals with the following topics: basic concepts on proteomics and metabolomics, instrumental analyses for proteomics and metabolomics, researches on proteomics and metabolomics for plants, and researches on proteomics and metabolomics for trees.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding the research trends of proteomics and metabolomics in trees.","course_schedule":"Lecture 1: Genome sequencing and post-genomics in plants\nLecture 2: Outline of proteomics and metabolomics\nLecture 3: Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in proteomics\nand metabolomics\nLecture 4: Research examples of proteomics and metabolomics in plants\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Provided in class","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"I hope that this lecture will awaken your interest in proteomics and metabolomics.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/14/2018 4:32:27 PM","name":{"id":1693,"ja":"外国人留学生特別セミナーⅣ","en":"Spesial Seminar Ⅳ for Internatinal Students"},"instructor":{"id":938,"ja":"横田 信三（宇）","en":"YOKOTA Shinsoh"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"United Graduate School Agricultural Science","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
