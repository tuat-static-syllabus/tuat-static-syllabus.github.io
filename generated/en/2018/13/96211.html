Chronic\ninflammation promotes tumor development, progression, and metastatic dissemination, as well as\nresistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, regulation of inflammation is critical for the treatment of cancer.\nIn this lecture, fundamental techniques for cancer diagnosis, latest therapeutic approach for cancer,\nincluding pharmacological approach, are reviewed. Information on ADME (absorption, distribution,\nmetabolism and excretion) of anti-cancer drug and brief history of the discovery of natural compounds\nfor cancer treatment will be provided. At the end of the lecture, our recent research work focusing on\ncancer stem cells will be introduced.","expected_learning":"This lecture will be provided based on the fundamental biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology,\nphysiology, pharmacology in order to let you know the clinical and basic research regarding cancer and\ninflammation.","course_schedule":"１：Latest technology for the diagnosis of cancer\n２：Latest therapeutic approach against cancer\n(1)The development of anti-cancer drugs (2)The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion\nof drugs\n３：The signal transduction involved in the crosstalk in between cancer and inflammation\n４：Introduction of basic research targeting cancer stem cells","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided in class.","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/23/2018 5:18:11 PM","name":{"id":1658,"ja":"分子生理学特論","en":"Advanced Molecular Physiology"},"instructor":{"id":1305,"ja":"鈴木 絵里子","en":"SUZUKI Eriko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"To be announced in the lectures."}}
