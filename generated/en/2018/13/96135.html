To study the mechanism of biological\nphenomena at the molecular level, synthesizing low－molecular－weight biologically active substances and\ntheir probes with precision methods are required. Basic and new methodologies in the chemical synthesis\nof required compounds and recent developments in chemical biology are reviewed. Some examples are\ndescribed in this lecture.","expected_learning":"To understand the outline of basic and new methodologies in the chemical synthesis of required\ncompounds and recent developments in chemical biology.","course_schedule":"1.
