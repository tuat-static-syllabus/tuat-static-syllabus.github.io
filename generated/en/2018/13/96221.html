The distribution and quantitative estimation of woody biomass on the earth will be shown and the characteristics of their chemical structures will be explained. The chemical structure of cellulose molecule, its functions, the biodegradation mechanism and some industrial applications will be also presented. Furthermore, chemically modified cellulose, such as cellulose derivatives and oxidized cellulose, will be also introduced.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding the characteristics of woody biomass and considering its effective and sustainable utilization.\n\n\n","course_schedule":"１． Woody biomass\n(1) Distribution and quantitative estimation, (2) Characteristics of chemical structures\n２． Cellulose\n(1) Fundamentals of carbohydrate chemistry, (2) Chemical structure, （3）Biodegradation, （4）Industrial Applications\n３． Chemically modified cellulose\n(1) Cellulose derivatives, (2) Oxidized cellulose\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided in class.","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"Well understanding and effective utilization of woody biomass is important to make our lives sustainable.
