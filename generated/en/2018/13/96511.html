Such research has been proceeded crossing the research areas such as history, sociology, folklore and geography after 1980’s. I’d like to survey such research, although I think I will be able to cover small part of them. We can anticipate that these studies are already-known for doctoral students, but I’d like to trace these trends roughly trying to re-recognize a part of the trends of Social Sciences and Humanities about culture, history and environment of rural districts in Japan after the end of the 20th century.","expected_learning":"Understanding some research trends of the environmental history of regionalism which have developed in Japan crossing the research areas such as history, sociology, folklore and geography since the end of the 20th century.","course_schedule":"Although I once make the course schedule as follows, I think that I will need to omit some parts of it considering shortage of the lecture time.
