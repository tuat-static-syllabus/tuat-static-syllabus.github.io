The\nseed has the tolerances for various environmental stresses and remain viable for many years. Under\nfavorable conditions, the seed can then germinate, with its stored nourishment providing critical support\nfor growth as the embryo emerges as a seedling. Such superior features of the seed become the\nadvantage for evolutional survival of seed plants. Therefore, the seed is extremely important structure\nfor plants. In addition, human depends greatly on seeds of plants for foods. We also utilize the seeds to\nfeed livestock. Thus, the biology about the seed is very interesting and valuable science. In this lecture,\nthe process of development, maturation and germination of seed are reviewed as a subject in rice. Then,\nthe utilization of traits, such as stress tolerance, dormancy and longevity, in seeds for crop cultivation\nand breeding sciences is explained.","expected_learning":"Understanding the method for analysis of proteins in seeds, the mechanism of gene expression\nduring early phase in seed germination and the outline of hot water disinfection of seeds.","course_schedule":"1.
