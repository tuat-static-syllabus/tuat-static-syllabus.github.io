These stressors cause the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the insect’s body. ROS are the intermediates of oxygen reduction processes such as respiration redox reactions, chemical metabolism, and energy production. Under normal conditions, ROS can be useful for the body, as they serve as secondary messengers. However, with excessive exposure to stressors, the production of additional ROS leads to oxidative stress. Environmental conditions can have physiological effects on insect development, aging, growth, longevity, survival, and reproduction. However, insects can rapidly adapt to environmental changes through physiological responses.\nIf we can clarify how insects is adapted to the stress factors and which molecules they are using, we can elucidate a part of the mechanism of insect environmental adaptation strategy.\nWhile, they are completely different organisms between insects and human evolution, but there are many genes that are very similar in humans and insects. Also, important physiological processes are conserved between human and insects. In this lecture, I will review the outline of our latest research for the mechanism of stress response in the insects and introduce the examples of its application. Finally, we discuss how insects can be used for human studies in the future.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding the differences between physiological systems in insects and humans, and students will be able to discuss insect usage.","course_schedule":"（１）Automatically gene functional annotation in the insects.\n（２）Comparison of gene function of insects with the human.\n（３）Construction of human disease model using insects.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"To be announced in the lectures.","assessment":"Attendance 30%, Report 70%","message_from_instructor":"I’d like to introduce insect physiology and biochemistry, whose topics are interested in doctoral students with different fields of specialization.
