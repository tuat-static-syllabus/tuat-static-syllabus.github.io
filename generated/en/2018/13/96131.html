Using chemical pesticides with wrong ways affect deleterious impact against human health and environment. Biological control is one of the alternative methods to control insect pests instead of chemical control. Biological control is a part of IPM in which we control the pest by natural way but does not cause deleterious impact as above.\nIn this lecture we will focus on insect viruses as the biological control agents and their applied uses and biology. Insect viruses acquired host regulation mechanism to adapt holometabolous insects.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding of the basic knowledge about uses natural enemies as biological control agents and the research progress for interaction of insect hosts and their natural enemies.
