Therefore, it is very useful to understand the fundamental technology of electronic devices for them. In this lecture, I introduce how to measure environmental conditions and control them with a microcontroller kit for beginners (Arduino) which can control sensors and actuators. Specifically, I introduce how to control LEDs which are recently used for light sources of plant factories, to measure environmental condition (temperature etc.), and to control fans or windows based on the measured values. In addition, “Smart agriculture” using IoT is reviewed.\nThe beginners for electronic devices and programming are welcome.\n","expected_learning":"Fundamental of how to use a microcontroller, how to measure environmental condition, and how to control environmental conditions.","course_schedule":"1: Introduction of a microcontroller\n2: Software for controlling a microcontroller\n3.
