The formation of nodule\nis controlled by root and shoot. In this lecture, the mechanism of nodule formation and function of\nmatured nodule will be reviewed. The effects of environment in organogenesis of plants will be also\ndescribed.\nIn the field of plant research, it is important to measure plant growth, so a lot of measurement methods\nhave been developed.
