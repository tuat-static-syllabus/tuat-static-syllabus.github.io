Establishment of control methods using pesticides and resistant cultivars has established a stable food production system today. However, excessive dependence on such methods has also given rise to environmental pollution and various other problems. This lecture explains occurrence and control of the fungal plant diseases. Plant disease control methods in consideration of environmental impact mitigation, which have recently attracted attention, will be presented, and their practicability will be discussed.
