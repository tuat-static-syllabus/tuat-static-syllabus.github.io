This technology utilizes several beneficial soil microorganisms to increase supply of plant nutrients from soil to plants, and has a potential to reduce the amount of chemical fertilizer input without decreasing yield of crops.\nIn this lecture, I focus on (1) Characteristics of microorganisms inhabiting the crop rhizosphere, (2) Definition of biofertilizer, (3) Introduction of microbial species such as rhizobia and PGPR used for biofertilizer, (4) Current situation of diverse biofertilizer development in Asian countries. I also introduce R/D of our Bacillus biofertilizer \"Kikuichi\" for paddy rice.\n","expected_learning":"(Expect Learning)\nUnderstanding (1) The concept of biofertilizer, (2) Research and development method for biofertilizer, (3) Social implementation and diffusion technology for biofertilizer in the world including Japan.\n","course_schedule":"(Course Schedule)\n1.
