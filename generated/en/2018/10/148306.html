This course, focusing on the high-order brain functions of humans, will discuss the mechanisms of perception and motor control. It is intended to enable students to learn fundamental principles of human motor behavior observed in everyday life from the viewpoint of motor adaptation. In connection with the lectures, students will be required to read papers in the fields of neuroscience and experimental psychology regarding the flow and role of information in the sensory system-intracerebral information processing system-motor system, make bibliographic surveys regarding sensorimotor deficits, and discuss the significance of injury prevention and rehabilitation of disabled persons to enable the sufferers to spend their everyday lives richly and healthfully.","expected_learning":"To enable students to know the indispensability of the viewpoint of evolutionary theory to the understanding of human motor behavior, and to develop their ability to think about the possible impacts of a new sociocultural environment created by science and technology upon human behavior.","course_schedule":"1st: Introduction: Evolution theory-oriented approach to motor behavior.\n2nd: Neurophysiological basis of perception and motor control I (cell membrane, membrane potential, action potential, conduction and transmission of information, structure of skeletal muscle and muscle contraction, receptor, motor unit and electromyogram).\n3rd: Neurophysiological basis of perception and motor control II (stimulation and suppression in spinal cord, synaptic reflex, discretionary control of single muscle, single-joint motor pattern).\n4th: Perception and motor control, and cerebral functions I (Cerebral cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia, ascending tract and descending tract).\n5th: Perception and motor control, and cerebral functions II (reflex and practice, learning and memory, judgment, consciousness and unconsciousness).\n6th: Behavior I - Attitude control (roles of vestibular system, visual system and proprioceptive system, predictive attitude control, corrective attitude control, attitude and conjugate movement).\n7th: Behavior II - Locomotion (central pattern generator, center of locomotive movement, spinal gait, stumbling corrective reaction, transformation of gait pattern).\n8th-15th: Reading of papers written in English in the field of perception and motor control studies, followed by commentaries and discussions.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Materials prepared by instructor himself will be distributed.","assessment":"Evaluation based on the contents of attendance and reports.
