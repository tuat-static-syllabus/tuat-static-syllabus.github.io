Co. Inc.) will give a lecture on how scientific knowledge of microbiology, biochemistry, molecular microbiology so on, has been put to practical use in industry. It will give you a deep understanding from the basic concept of metabolic engineering at the early stage till the cutting-edge technologies, following some examples of strain breeding for amino acid production.","expected_learning":"・Have a deep understanding on usefulness and expectation of biotechnology, learning the development of Metabolic Engineering historically.\n・Learn the cutting-edge biotechnologies and their application to practical productions, and make a basic foundation in generating the student’s own idea.\n・Have an point of view from application research by looking back some case studies of practical development.\n","course_schedule":"Dr. Kikunae Ikeda who discovered the identity of “UMAMI” as glutamic acid and Mr. Saburosuke Suzuki who launched glutamic acid as “AJI-NO-MOTO”. Launching “AJI-NO-MOTO” is the world’s first creation of “UMAMI seasoning business”, leading industry-academia collaboration and open-innovation. Umami is recognized as one of the 5 basic tastes, Sweetness, Saltiness, Sourness, Bitterness and Umami.\nThen the second innovation, Corynebacterium glutamicum was discovered in 1957 in Japan as a natural producer of glutamate and industrial production of glutamate by “fermentation” has begun. This is the start of the amino acid fermentation. Amino acid fermentation has been expanded not only glutamate but also other amino acids and several technologies were developed. Recently, researches to design and construct biological systems for various useful products, even non-natural products has been active.\n　In this lecture, theory of metabolic engineering for strain breeding will be introduced following some practical cases of amino acid producer. Besides, development researches, that is utilization of various low materials, process developments (scale-up, fermentation, and purification), facilities, environmental and energy measures, patent strategy and so on will be described with concrete examples. I hope you could realize how scientific knowledge such as Metabolic engineering, Biochemical engineering, DNA recombination and Synthetic biology, you are learning, has put to practical use in industry. Also, it could serve you an opportunity to think your future path. A tour of Kawasaki factory and laboratory of Ajinomoto Co.is contained during the course.\nThe First Day (1st, Dec.)\n・ Discovered of umami and creation of amino acids business. Novel function of glutamate.\n・ Discovered of glutamate production microorganisms. /Why microorganism is used?\n/Breeding of strain for fermentation production by controlling metabolic regulation.\n・ DNA recombination technology and its regulation.\n/Case study：elucidation of mechanism of glutamate overproduction.\nThe Second Day (8nd, Dec.)\n・Breeding of strain by DNA recombination technology.\n/Case study：Breeding of various kinds of amino acid producing strains.\n・Utilization of various low materials /Process developments of fermentation\n/Facilities /Environmental measures.\n・Case study：Innovative pathway design for glutamate production.\nThe Third Day (9th, Dec.)\n・Enzymation technology for industry.\n/Case study：Development of phosphotransferase for nucleosides production.\n・Patent strategy・ Economical evaluation of fermentation industry.\n・Evolution and future of fermentation technology./Biofuel/White biotechnology/Synthetic biology\n・Question and answer session.\n","prerequisites":"Students are assumed to have basic knowledge on Biochemistry and Microbiology.","texts_and_materials":"None in particular.
