It will provide a broad overview of the historical evolution of this field from its earliest days to the present, a methodological and technological approach to problem solving, some specific issues (such as global warming and sustainable forest management), and some academic-related fields (such as forest and tree mensuration).\n\nGoal:\nForest planning (studies) is important in dealing effectively with problems surrounding forest. Therefore, the goal of these lectures is to establish a philosophy of forest planning (studies) capable of offering concrete solutions, gain deeper insight into forest and tree mensuration techniques and research data analysis methodology, and provide assistance in preparing the BA or MA thesis.\n","expected_learning":"（1）A clear understanding of the transition from the (old) forest management studies to the (present) forest planning studies, and new challenges facing the latter.\n（2）A clear understanding of the forest planning system in Japan.\n（3）A clear understanding of the solutions forest planning (studies) can provide to specific issues (such as global warming and sustainable forest management).\n（4）A clear understanding of analysis methodology of forest research data, and forest mensuration techniques.","course_schedule":"Part 1 Guidance and class work presentation\n\nPart 2-3 Structure of forest planning studies\n\nPart 4 Spatio-temporal scales in forest planning studies\n\nPart 5 Global warming countermeasures and forest planning\n\nPart 6 Sustainable forest management and forest certification\n\nPart 7 Midterm examination\n\nPart 8 Forest products industry and supply and demand of wood\n\nPart 9-10 Life cycle assessment (LCA)\n\nPart 11-12 Forest and forestry management\n\nPart 13-14 Forest mensuration studies\n\nPart 15 Final examination","prerequisites":"None.","texts_and_materials":"The course material will be distributed in class.","assessment":"Quiz (20%)，midterm examination (40%), final examination (40%)","message_from_instructor":"I hope that these lectures can help students understand the importance of analyzing and examining the various problems surrounding forest from the standpoint of forest planning studies.","course_keywords":"Forest planning, global warming, sustainable forest management, LCA, forest management studies, forest mensuration studies","office_hours":"For questions or comments, please contact the following email address: kayoc@cc.tuat.ac.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/14/2018 10:55:01 AM","name":{"id":336,"ja":"森林計画学","en":"Forest Planning"},"instructor":{"id":312,"ja":"加用 千裕","en":"KAYO Chihiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Tue.4","references":""}}
