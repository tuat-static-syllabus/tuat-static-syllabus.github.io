We cannot survive on the earth without plants, so their health is important to us. Such plants are always exposed by many stresses and attacks of pathogens. Various diseases actually occur in plants as well as animals or human beings, leading to severe damages and serious economical losses. Plant pathology covers all of the study of plant diseases. This 2-credit course provides the fundamental knowledge of “Plant Pathology” to undergraduate students with concrete descriptions as described below. If possible, we will make chances to observe actually some diseases occurred in our campus.","expected_learning":"Through this course we enable the students to enrich their understanding of plant potentials against the xenobiotics and pathogen strategies to survive、and also to recognize the importance of plant protection.","course_schedule":"In this course we will provide about 15 classes including the final examination in the 1st semester. The class contains the fundamentals of plant pathology and potential functions of plants against their pathogens as described below.\n1. What are the causes of diseases in plants?\n1-1. Describe the biotic pathogens of infectious diseases in plants such as fungi, bacteria, mycoplasma, nematodes, higher plants, and non-true biotic agents such as virus and viroid, and their general microbiology and nature of the diseases.\n1-2. Describe the abiotic factors of transient diseases in plants and their nature of the diseases.\n2. How can the pathogen attack its host plant, and complete to infect and disperse the progeny to other host plants?\n3. When and how does the plant respond and battle to the pathogen attack?\n4. What mechanisms and genes are associated with the plant reaction?\n5. What weapons and genes does the pathogen retain in attack to the plants?\n6. Current diagnosis and assessment in plant diseases.\n7. Current and prospective status to control plant diseases.\n","prerequisites":"No specific prerequisite.","texts_and_materials":"All data in the course can be available by downloading through the Moodle system on the web. Some parts of the data will be distributed by printing in some classes.","assessment":"Based on the final examination.","message_from_instructor":"The related courses in the undergraduate level are recommendable to learn; Phytopathogenic microbiology, Plant protection, General microbiology, Plant physiology, Cell biology, Biochemistry, Molecular biology, Genetics.","course_keywords":"plant disease, molecular plant-microbe interaction, disease resistance, virulence/pathogenicity of pathogen, diagnosis, disease controls","office_hours":"No set office hours (but regularly present in my office from 12:00 to around 13:00).
