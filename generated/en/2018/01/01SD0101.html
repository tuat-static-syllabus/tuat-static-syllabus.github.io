Resolving these issues and constructing a sustainable society requires efforts from a broad range of perspectives extending beyond the pivotal agriculture and engineering framework. Now more than ever, we believe that the role we play as researchers in realizing an environmentally-sustainable society is important, and it is our duty as a leading research-oriented academic institution to vigorously engage in our philosophy of \"Mission-Oriented Research and Education giving Synergy in Endeavors toward a Sustainable Earth (“MORE SENSE”) for our endeavors in what we call “green innovation” and “life innovation,” or the innovation of environmental and life sciences. Innovation, which at its core can be defined as “a creation of new fundamental values,” cannot be achieved unless an assertive approach based on meaningful cooperation between educational institutions, business, and the public sector is taken.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"4/12\n10:30〜 General guidance of \" Introduction to MORE SENSE\"\n10:35〜 President Dr. Ohno（35 min）\n11:10〜 Dean, Faculty of Agriculture: Dr. Chiba（35 min）\n11:45〜 writing impressions essay（15 min）\n\n4/19\n10:30〜 Dean, Faculty of Engineering: Dr. Misawa (30 min)\n11:05〜 Department of Biological Production: Dr. Kanekatsu（25min）\n11:20〜 “Global education and studying abroad”（25 min）\n11:55〜 writing impressions essay（10min）\n\n4/26\n10:30〜 Department of Applied Biological Science: Dr. Kawaide（25 min）\n11:00〜 Department of Ecoregion Science: Dr. Tsuchiya（25 min）\n11:25〜 “Safety education” Dr. Miura (30 min）\n11:50〜 writing impressions essay（10 min）\n\n5/10\n10:30〜 Department of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences: Dr. Takada（20 min）\n10:50〜 Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine: Dr. Sibata (20 min)\n11:10〜 “Career education” Dr. Moriyama（35 min）\n11:45〜 writing impressions essay（15 min）\n\n5/17\n10:30〜 Introduction of lecturer\n10:35〜 “Research ethics” Dr. Shirabe from TIT（75 min）\n11:50〜 writing impressions essay（15 min）\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Final report and attend (short reports)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"TUAT, MORE SENSE","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/10/2018 4:33:45 PM","name":{"id":414,"ja":"MORE SENSE 入門","en":"Introduction to MORE SENSE"},"instructor":{"id":18,"ja":"西河 淳","en":"NISHIKAWA Atsushi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"general education courses","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Thu.2","references":""}}
