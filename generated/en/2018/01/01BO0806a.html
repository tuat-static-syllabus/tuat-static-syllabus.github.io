Guidance\n\n#1. Ecology of Insects I. (Yoshida T.)\nPurpose: Understand an animal-plant interaction by investigating insect damage to acorns of oak species.\nContents: Collect and assess the acorns of six oak species in Fuchu campus, and then compare them as insect microhabitats.\n\n#2. Ecology of Insects II. (Koike S.)\nPurpose: Understanding the relationships between habitat condition and insect.\nContents: Collecting the carabid beetles at the multiple environment and compare the carabid beetle fauna among the environments.\n\n#3. Morphology of Mammals (Kaneko Y. & Suzuki K.)\nPurpose: Examine general skeletal differences among mammalian species, learn how to do sex and age identification, and growth.\nContents: Observe wild boar skulls of a regional population, and identify those age by measuring mandible bone length. Based on the measured data, discuss about growth and sexual dimorphism.\n\n#4. Ecology of Plants (Hoshino Y.)\nPurpose: To understand the habitat and environmental factors of plant community.\nContents: Vegetation survey using quadrat method and data analysis (caliculation of index of species diversity, similarity index etc.)\n\n#5. Morphology of Vascular Plants (Akasaka M.)\nPurpose: Understand basic physical structure of vascular plants.\nContents: Observe and sketch several types of leaves.\n\n#6. Animal Body (Watanabe G.)\nPurpose: Using frogs as a model, students will learn the fundamental structure of animals.\nContents: Students will observe body structure of the frog, and make a perfusion model of the frog heart. They will observe heart beats and conduct an experiment to test effects of temperature and some chemicals.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"6/11/2018 1:52:30 PM","name":{"id":207,"ja":"生物学実験","en":"Fundamental Experiment on Biology"},"instructor":{"id":188,"ja":"崔 東寿","en":"CHOI Dongsu"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"農学部","category":"全学共通教育科目","department":"","semester":"前学期","course_type":"前学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"","day_period":"火3～5","references":""}}
