Therefore, in this society, engineering ethics is not a manual which only engineers should learn, nor a just one part of an ethics. Engineering ethics involves basic problems which every people confront in their everyday life. The purpose of this course is to study about the basic problems of technology and ethics (ex. the ethics of the future generation, or risk society, etc.), and to study how to solve the peculiar problems (like pollution problems, environmental destructions, whistle-blowing, handling the big data and biotechnology, etc.) which engineer are faced. We study these topics through the specific cases.\n","expected_learning":"1. To understand the basic framework of ethics, apply it and determine the various specific case which engineers are faced.\n2. To understand the various problems which engineering were faced, and explain how they responded in terms of ethics.\n3.
