We also comment on the relationship between those organisms and human life.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to explain the taxonomy, morphology, and physiology of life from the viewpoints of phylogeny and comparative biology.","course_schedule":"[Plant Phylogeny]\n1.
