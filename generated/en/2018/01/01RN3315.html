Participants evaluate biodiversity of the forest by identifying soil invertebrates and fungi.\nArboriculture (tree doctor) assessment is classified into two diagnoses: firstly, visual tree assessment and secondary diagnosis by using devices. The participants learn about comprehensive visual tree assessment, the principles of the devices, and how to use them. Based on these lecture, they will get skills to make Arboricultural reports. They also observe field sites to examine the methods of contraction and thinking about tree treatments.\n","expected_learning":"Criterion for achievement: Obtain the basic skills for making academic reports, by understanding the broad range of practices related to forest protection and tree health. All participants need to attend all lectures (See Prerequisite and Remark 1 and 2).","course_schedule":"Forest soundness\n1. Observe animal tracking such as footprints and feeding damages, and of protective methods against tree damages in forests.\n2. Examine the wildlife management and prevention of animal damages, by investigating bark-stripping by bears.\n3. Make inventory of soil fauna in the different stands and observe them by using a microscope.\n4. Examine the diversity and composition of soil fauna. Count and observe the insect damages.\n5. Observe the diseases of various tree species: symptoms and sign of diseases.\n6. Research fungal community detected from sound and infected leaves. 1) Sterilization, Preparing culture media, and sterile operation.\n7. Research fungal community detected from sound and infected leaves. 2) Culture, fungal flora, and speculum.\n8. Extract nematodes from pine woods: A, Baerrmann funnel method; B, LAMP assay for pine wilt nematodes.\n9. Diversity of forest-floor fungi: Ectomycorrhizal and saprophytic fungi.\n\nTree diagnosis and tree care treatments\n10. The concept and method of visual tree assessment, and method for environmental conditions.\n11. Method for diagnostic work-up by using machines (mainly diagnosis for decay): diagnosis of tree trunks, testing with the resistograph system, ultrasonic velocity measurement of wood, Gamma-ray CT method, trunk temperature measurement, and Shigometer measuring.\n12. Measure transpiration rate, SPAD value, water potential of xylem, and leaf temperature.\n13. Soil research: estimation of soil profile by penetration test and permeability test.\n14.&15. Diagnosis and treatment of urban street trees and old trees as natural monuments (1. observation and 2. making diagnosis and tree care reports): Make a tree architectural diagram and crown projection diagram, and express the problems of the parts of the trees. Know the environmental conditions of the trees and make the secondary diagnosis of tree health and treatment, and then, make the reports of visual tree assessment.\n\nAll participants learn about No.1 to No.13 from 4 to 8 August, 2018. As the summary of No.14 and No.15, they listen to the explanation of the management of cultural assets of each tree around Ueno and the management of urban street trees at Yotsuya, Akasaka, Aoyama, and Harajuku on 31th August, 2018. Based on the observations, each participant makes tree diagnostic reports.\nWe hold a lecture for follow-up explanations associated with submitted reports at 420 room in Building1 from 09:00 on 6 October, 2018.","prerequisites":"We will hold a pre-explanation meeting at 420 room in Building 1 from 12:30 on 16 April, 2017 (all absentees cannot take this course). We will proceed this practice based on the premise that all participants take some classes associated with forest ecology, especially, Practice on Silviculture and Practice on Forest Dendrology.\n* No one take this course unless paying food expenses and submit preparation assignments at Room 401 in Building 1 by 8 June 2018. See Remark 2.\n** You cannot take this course if you take another class overlapping with this one. And we only evaluate the scores of a person who attend all days and submit all reports.\n\n","texts_and_materials":"We provide a handout accordingly.","assessment":"Evaluation method of a grade:\nThis course has many reports due to an intensive practice. Please submit quickly them with concise description. Because the reports need the data obtained by all participants, they should share the integrated data immediately.\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Forest soundness, Wildlife management, Biodiversity, Tree diagnosis, Hazard tree assessment, Tree treatment","office_hours":"We welcome your questions about the topics of this course.
