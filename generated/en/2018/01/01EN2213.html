Soils have typically been studied from three aspects: 1) their relationship to plant growth, 2) their relationship to engineering and environmental properties, and 3) their formation as a natural geological and ecological phenomenon. The goal of this course is to give you a broad exposure of soil science knowledge and concepts.","expected_learning":"Students are required to understand basic soil properties and agricultural and environmental functions.","course_schedule":"1.
