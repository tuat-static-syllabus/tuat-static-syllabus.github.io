Digest λ phage-derived DNA with a restriction enzyme, ligate those fragments into a plasmid vector and transform E. coli bacterial cells. Isolate single colonies by streaking a plate. Purify DNA of interest from E. coli competent cells and confirm that exogenous DNA (DNA of interest) was inserted by (i) digestion with restriction enzyme followed by SDS-PAGE, (ii) determination base sequence.\nB class：Purify chromosomal DNA from thale-cress and confirm recombination of genes by using PCR analysis. Students will also purify genomic DNA from Bacillus subtilis and determine the purity of DNA.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Text will be provided in class.
