Metabolic activity of individual microorganisms are minute, but they contribute strongly to elements cycle in biosphere due to their huge biomass. This course provides knowledge how microorganisms live in natural environments, and how various microbial metabolic activities involve in the existence of human beings. And, we can utilise various microbial metabolic activities for clean-up of polluted environments and resource problems. This course aims to provide a basic knowledge for application of microorganisms to solve environmental problems.","expected_learning":"1. To improve the knowledge about microorganisms.\n2.
