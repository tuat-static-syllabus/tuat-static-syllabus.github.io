The topics covered are the nature of atomos and electron, and the behavior and reactions of alkanes, alkenes and alkynes.","expected_learning":"Understand shape of molecule based on the orbital, and hybrid orbital.\nUnderstand chemical bond: covalent bond sharing two electrons by two atoms which are combined with each other by a chemical bond.\nUnderstand chemical reactions based on electron transfer: chemical reaction means fission or formation of chemical bond. Chemical reaction takes place with electron transfer.\n","course_schedule":"Structure and Bond, Acids and Bases\nAtomic structure: Nucleus, Orbitals, Electron Configuration, Chemical bonding theory, Hybrid orbitals, Drawing chemical structure, Polar covalent bonds, Acids and Bases\n\nOrganic Compounds: Alkanes and Their Stereochemistry\nFunctional Groups, Alkanes and Alkane Isomers, Naming Alkanes, Conformation of Ethane, Naming Cycloalkane\n\nAlkenes: Structure and Reactivity\nCis-Trans Isomers of Alkenes, Stability of Alkenes, An Overview of Reactions, Equilibria, Rates, and Energy Changes, Transition States and Intermediates\n\nReactions of Alkenes and Alkynes\nReaction of Alkenes: Addition Reactions, Elimination Reactions, Hydrogenation, Chain-Growth Polymers, Reaction of Alkynes: Preparation of Alkynes, Addition Reactions, Hydrations, Alkyne Acidity\n\nEach segment is mostly completed in three times of lectures\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"J. E. McMurry and E. E.

I try so that the beginning may be advanced slowly, so it's desirable to understand in lecture time.\nIt is positively recommended to prepare by reading the text book, and to repeat for understanding. It's important to solve the exercise which appears on the end in each chapter.\n","course_keywords":"organic compound, chemical reaction, reaction mechanism","office_hours":"Questions and comments are acceptable by e-mail.
