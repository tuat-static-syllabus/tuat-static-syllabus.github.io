Quantitative and qualitative information of molecules can be acquired by the spectroscopy as well as by mid-infrared spectroscopy. Spectra of samples containing water such as living bodies and plants because NIR radiation can penetrate the samples. However, it is difficult to identify and assign the peaks in NIR spectra; special techniques are needed to analyze the spectra. Multivariate analysis, particularly Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), is most frequently used as the technique for the analyses.\nThis special lecture aims the understand the followings.\n1. Principles of NIR spectroscopy\n2. Principles of PLSR\n3. Applications of NIR spectroscopy and PLSR\n","expected_learning":"Deep understanding of the following points.\n1. Comparison of the characteristics of NIR spectroscopy with other spectroscopic techniques such as that of IR spectroscopy\n2. Advantages and disadvantages of applying NIR spectroscopy\n3.
