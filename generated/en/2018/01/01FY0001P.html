Diversity acquired in the process of evolution is also closely related to the diversity of diseases at the same time. Learning the structures of such various animal bodies and diseases related thereto is important not only from biology but also from the viewpoint of comparative medicine. Medical is the final goal of improving the convenience of human society and happiness, but it is a well-known fact that much information provided by zoology and animal health care contributes to its development. This basic seminar learns the structure and characteristics of the body in practical terms and experiences animals breeding and medical care in relation to animals such as horses and dogs who have lived with people for a long time. Also, for experimental animals that provide information useful for human medical care, study characteristics, concrete usage or handling methods.
