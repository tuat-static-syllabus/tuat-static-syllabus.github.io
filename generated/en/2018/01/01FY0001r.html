It seems to be related to temperature, thermal capacity (specific heat), molecular motions, and chemical reactions. However, do we fully understand the basic physics and chemistry in heating processes ? In this class, every student will survey information and data on a given subject related to heating, and will give presentation to other students to express one's opinion obtained in the survey.","expected_learning":"Improvement of ability for students to obtain necessary knowledge, information and data for their own subjects via active learning.
