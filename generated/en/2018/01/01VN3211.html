Animal General Pathology is a discipline that deals with the study of responses and rules to all diseases, taking into account all the pathogenic factors and morbid circumstances, which can be found in different animals, but always from a general point of view. The purpose of General Pathology includes understanding of basic knowledge necessary for morphological analysis of lesions developed in each disease of animals, as well as acquisition of pathological terms necessary for conduct of diagnosis in practice.\n\nOutline: Pathological lesions developed in animals can primarily be classified morphologically into circulatory disturbance, cellular degenerations, cellular deaths, adaptive changes, proliferative/neoplastic changes, and malformations. General Pathology deals with general rules on the mechanisms of the lesion development in relation with etiology by means of physiological, biochemical and molecular biological assessments, as well as morphological views.","expected_learning":"1. Understand the historical transition of pathology and relationship between diagnostic pathology and experimental pathology\n2. Understand the outlines of the structure and function of cells as a basic element of lesions as well as the cellular processes responsible for induction of cellular injury.\n3. Understand the degenerative cellular changes, apoptosis and necrosis, senescence, inclusion bodies, and postmortem changes.\n4. Understand the atrophy, hypertrophy and hyperplasia, metaplasia, and dysplasia.\n5. Understand the cell proliferation mechanism, stem cell, cellular regenerating potentials, regeneration process of bone and peripheral nerves, wound healing and fibrosis, and extracellular matrix.\n6. Understand the ischemia, hemorrhage, thromboembolism, infarction, edema, and shock.\n7. Understand the concept of inflammation, chemical mediators, nomenclature of inflammatory responses, morphological characteristics of inflammation, and sequelae of inflammation.\n8. Understand the immune responses, cytokines, allergy, transplantation immunity, autoimmune disease, and immunodeficiency.\n9. Understand the definition and classification of tumors, terminology used in oncology, macroscopical nature of tumors, histological characteristics of benign and malignant tumors, modalities of metastasis, influence on host, tumor immunity and etiology of carcinogenesis.\n10. Understand the cause and mechanism of abnormalities in chromosomes, genes, and development, as well as the classification of abnormalities.","course_schedule":"1. History and conceptual aspects of pathology, structure and function of cells and cell injury mechanisms, focusing on the historical transition of pathology, etiology and concepts in pathology, outlines of the structure and function of cells, causes of cellular injury, principles and biochemical mechanisms in cellular processes responsible for induction of cellular injury, and major causative factors of cellular injury.\n2. Injury and death of cells and tissues in terms of the classification of morphological changes in cellular injury and their causative abnormalities in cellular metabolism.\n3. Injury and death of cells and tissues in terms of the cell and tissue death and senescence.\n4. Injury and death of cells and tissues in terms of the inclusion bodies, and postmortem changes. Cellular adaptation and abnormalities in cellular differentiation, such as atrophy, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, metaplasia and dysplasia.\n5. Cellular proliferation and differentiation and their aberrations, focusing on cell proliferation mechanism, stem cell, extracellular matrix, cellular regeneration, wound healing, fibrosis, and scar formation.\n6. Circulatory disturbance, in terms of hemorrhage, thromboembolism, ischemia and infarction, edema, and shock.\n7. Concept of inflammation, tissue changes in inflammation, and chemical mediators related to inflammation.\n8. Difference in acute and chronic inflammation, nomenclature of inflammatory responses, classification and morphological characteristics of inflammatory changes, and sequelae of inflammation.\n9. Immune pathology, in terms of the immune system, immune responses and cytokine networks.\n10. Immune pathology, in terms of the allergy, transplantation immunity, autoimmune disease, and immunodeficiency.\n11. Tumor pathology, in terms of the definition and classification of tumors, terminology used in oncology, macroscopical nature of tumors, histological characteristics of benign and malignant tumors and modalities of metastasis.\n12. Tumor pathology, in terms of the influence on host, tumor immunity and etiology of carcinogenesis.\n13. Abnormalities in chromosomes, genes, and development, in terms of the causative factors, as well as the modality and classification of anomalies.","prerequisites":"It is necessary to take course of cell biology, genetics, veterinary anatomy, veterinary histology, veterinary physiology, veterinary biochemistry, veterinary microbiology, immunology before taking this class.","texts_and_materials":"Use “Animal General Pathology, 3rd Edition”, edited by Japanese Society of Veterinary Pathology as a textbook. Powerpoint documents will also be handed out.","assessment":"Regular achievement tests: 100%. There are no attendance points.","message_from_instructor":"Pathology is one of the academic disciplines required for the National Veterinary Medical Practitioners Qualifying Examination. Animal Pathology is positioned between basic veterinary classes and clinical classes, and thus, it is necessary to have knowledge on anatomy, histology, immunology, and microbiology to have appropriate understanding of lesions. It will be difficult to have appropriate understandings on clinical classes, such as veterinary surgery and veterinary internal medicine.","course_keywords":"Pathomorphology, Pathoanatomy, Histopathology, Immunopathology, Oncopathology","office_hours":"Office hour：8:30〜18:30.
