Outline of forest ecosystems\nThe concept of forests, forming conditions, and the classification and distribution of forests.\nThe concept of ecosystems, structure and function of ecosystems, and the characteristics of forest ecosystems.\nTemperature, winds, microclimatic modification, and environment inside forests.\nWater, evapotranspiration, and watershed conservation.\n\n3-4. Material production and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems\nMaterial production, biomass, production structure, and production rate in forest ecosystems.\nNutrient cycling, decomposition, and dynamics of nutrients in forest ecosystems.\n\n5-12. Living components of forest ecosystems and their functional roles\nClassification and characteristics of trees, structure, succession, and regeneration of trees.\nInteraction between trees and environmental factors and their roles in forest ecosystems.\nClassification and characteristics of mammals and birds in forest ecosystems.\nRoles of mammals and birds in forest ecosystems.\nClassification and characteristics of insects and soil invertebrates in forest ecosystems.\nRoles of insects and soil invertebrates in forest ecosystems.\nClassification and characteristics of microorganisms in forest ecosystems.\nRoles of microorganisms in forest ecosystems.\n\n13-15.
