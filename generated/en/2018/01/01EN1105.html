Main contents of this course are basic ways of thinking, fundamental knowledge and techniques in analytical chemistry to get reliable and precise data. Introduction to the theory of errors and multivariate analyses for proper handling of experimental data is also given.\nSome parts of this course are connected closely with the subjects on analytical chemistry in “Fundamental Experiment on Chemistry”.\nSpectroscopies and mass spectrometry, which are lectured in detail in “Instrumental Analytical Chemistry”, are only introduced briefly here, while the lecture on chromatography is given here.\n","expected_learning":"(1) Understanding and learning of basic procedures and ways of thinking in analytical chemistry.\n(2) Learning of knowledge on basic apparatuses and instruments for analytical chemistry, and how to use them to get correct and valuable data.\n(3) Learning how to handle experimental data.\n","course_schedule":"According to the schedule of the TAT “Fundamental Experiment on Chemistry”, the order of lectures may be changed.\n\nLecture No. 1 （October 2） Guidance of this course and introduction to analytical chemistry\nLecture No. 2 （October 9） Classification and procedures of chemical analyses\nLecture No. 3 （October 16） Basic laboratory wares and procedures for analyses: Titration\nLecture No. 4 （October 23） Basic laboratory wares and procedures for analyses:\nLecture No. 5 (October 30) Guidance of the subjects on analytical in “Fundamental Experiment on Chemistry”\nLecture No. 6 (November 6) Unit system, references, standards, and validation for precise and meaningful data\nLecture No. 7 (November 13) Errors and uncertainty (1): Precision and accuracy\nLecture No. 8 (November 20) Errors and uncertainty (2): How to deal experimental data\nLecture No. 9 (November 27) Volumetric analysis (titration) and gravimetric analysis\n45-minutes midterm examination will be held in Lecture 9 or 10.\nLecture No. 10 (December 4) Stoichiometry calculation 1\nLecture No. 11 (December 11) Stoichiometry calculation 2\nLecture No. 12 （December 18） Chromatography 1\nLecture No. 13 （January 8） Chromatography 2\nLecture No. 14 （January 15） Introduction to chemometrics 1\nLecture No. 15 （January 22） Introduction to chemometrics 2\nFinal examination （January 29）\n","prerequisites":"　It is desirable to have fundamental knowledge of general chemistry.\n　Related courses are Physical Chemistry A, Physical Chemistry B, Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Instrumental Analytical Chemistry, Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics in Nature, and so on.\n　Examples of chemical analyses are shown in many other courses given in Department of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences.\n","texts_and_materials":"G.
