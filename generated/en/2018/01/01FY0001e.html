After you understand what is biofertilizers, you explore biofertilizers in the world. And, you present the results of your exploration of the world biofertilizers. Finally, you understand roles of biofertilzers in sustainable agriculture systems in the world.\n\n","expected_learning":"Study goal is to understand roles of biofertilzers in sustainable agriculture systems in the world.","course_schedule":"In 2016, world population is 7,300 million, and many researchers are estimating that will increase up to 9,000 million in the middle of this 21 Century.\n\nIn order to supply food to increasing population in the world, agricultural production should be increased.\n\nTo increases agricultural production, increases of fertilizer inputs containing nitrogen nutrient are especially required.\n\n●Around 9% of world natural gas production and 3% of world fossil oil production are consumed to produce ammonia in the Haber-Bosh process at every year.\n\nIn the middle of twenty-first century, the fossil oil reserves will be depleted (within about 40 years) and so with the natural gas (within about 60 years) in the shallow surface of the earth.\n\nThis will lead to higher cost of chemical synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, and eventually to low food production.\n\nIn case of agricultural practices, most of fertilizers are chemical fertilizers, however oil and natural gas are needed to produce chemical fertilizer shown by a previous slide and shortage of rock phosphate, which is a raw material for phosphorus chemical fertilizer, is beginning a serious problem.\n\nFurthermore, improper use of chemical fertilizer and other agrochemicals damage agro-environment, for example nitrate pollution in ground water.\n\nTherefore, establishment of environmental friendly sustainable agriculture in the world and reduction of agrochemical input are required.\n\nOne way to reduce the amount of chemical nitrogen fertilizers input without decreasing yield of crops is utilization function of beneficial microorganisms.\n\nBiofertilizer is a substance which contains living microorganisms which, when applied to seed, plant surfaces, or soil, colonizes the rhizosphere or the interior of the plant and promotes growth by increasing the supply or availability of primary nutrients to the host plant (Vessey, J.K. 2003).\n\nIn this seminar, I present current situation of biofertilizer developments in Asian countries, then I also present current situation of biofertilizer developments in Japan. After you understand what is biofertilizers, you explore biofertilizers in the world. And, you present the results of your exploration of the world biofertilizers.\n\n\n\n\n\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Biofertilizer, sustainable agriculture, Chemical fertilizer, Beneficial soil microorganisms","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/23/2018 6:17:38 PM","name":{"id":298,"ja":"農学基礎ゼミ","en":"Basic Seminar of Agricultural Science"},"instructor":{"id":1038,"ja":"横山 正","en":"YOKOYAMA Tadashi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"general education courses","department":"Applied Biological Science, Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences, Ecoregion Science, Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Thu.1","references":""}}
