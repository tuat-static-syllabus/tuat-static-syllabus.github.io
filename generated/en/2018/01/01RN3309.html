Students must study many tree species to understand forest ecology and hardwood forestry. It is a first step to identify forest tree species to recognize forest diversity. Though each flower is a key for classification of plants, we get flowers only at short time due to their phenology. Leaves and twigs can be observed anytime in a year, at least five months for deciduous trees and whole year for ever green species. In this course, students get about 240 tree species samples in some types of forests in Kanto area and learn their names and characteristics.","expected_learning":"Students need to gain ability to identify trees by observation a twig with some leaves.\nAnd also you need to gain methods of drawing tree leaves and making dried sample of leaves, and to get much information of forest trees.\n","course_schedule":"Field practice\nSampling leaves, surveying and drawing vertical structure of forest.\nForays (brief excursion in forests)\nConifer and ever green broad leaved trees in Fuchu campus.\nDeciduous trees in Fuchu campus.\nCoppice trees at FM Tama Hill in early spring.\nCoppice trees in Santomi area of Saitama prefecture.\nRiparian forest trees in deep mountains in FM Kusaki.\nOld secondary forest trees in deep mountains in FM Kusaki.\nTrees in a forest edge and gap in FM Kusaki.\nTrees in low mountains in Takao 1( Hikage river)\nTrees in low mountains in Takao 2( Jataki river)\nCoppice trees at FM Tama Hill in hot summer.\n","prerequisites":"It is recommended that students have learned forest ecology and dendrology.","texts_and_materials":"The handouts will be provided.","assessment":"Final examination of identifying tree species 75%, reports(drawings,collecting samples and some descriptions) 25%.\n\n2016年　S7, A11,B4,C3,D7\n2015年　S14,A4,B2,C5,D2\n2014年　S10,A8,B3,C8,D6","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"boroad-leaved trees, deciduos trees, conifer, forest edge, raiparian forest, coppice","office_hours":"Please make an appointment by email.","remarks_1":"This course belongs to the packages of forest biology and forest environment.
