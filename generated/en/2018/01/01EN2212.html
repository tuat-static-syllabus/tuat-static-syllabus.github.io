In addition to the conventional material design method of maximizing performance and minimizing cost, Eco Material is a material and design method that minimizes environmental impact throughout the entire process (production cycle, production, use, recycling, and disposal) . In this lecture, as a basic section, we will comprehensively and multifacetly describe the concepts necessary for designing eco-materials. In addition, in the application section, we will describe the characteristics of materials currently considered as eco-materials (mainly materials made from wood and wood resources, plastic materials, etc.).","expected_learning":"As various environmental problems surround, understand the basic idea of eco-friendly materials (eco-materials) and the direction that materials should aim.","course_schedule":"What is Eco Material?\n1) Environment and materials\n2) Structure and function of various materials\n3) Eco-materialization of materials\n4) Eco-material design of wood-based materials\n\n(Point of Course)\nI will brush my thoughts and sensibilities that can totally capture the achievements (positive aspects) and negative aspects of science and technology.\n\n2.
