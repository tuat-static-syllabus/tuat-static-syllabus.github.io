Human activities effect on nature via society, and changes of nature effect on humans via society. Without this viewpoint, it is nonsense to think environmental problems. This class provide students viewpoint to think root causing environmental problems and what we need to solve the problems. And, structure and function of ecosystem, which is fundamental scientific knowledge for thinking environmental problems, are lectured.","expected_learning":"Students are expected to,\n\n1. understand structure and function of ecosystem,\n2. acquire a habit to think the root causing environmental problems,\n3. acquire a habit to think environmental problems quantitatively.","course_schedule":"Specific coverage will include:\n\n1. A viewpoint understand environmental problem\n2. The difference between \"Ecosystem Science\" and \"Ecology\"\n3. Structure and function of ecosystem\n(1) Fundamental structure\n(2) Natural ecosystem\n(3) Urban ecosystem\n(4) Agricultural ecosystem\n(5) Production and consumption of organic materials, and energy flow\n(6) Ecological succession\n(7) Ecosystem service\n(8) Odum's compartment model\n4. Food production and ecosystem conservation\n5. Hydrological cycle, afforestation and flood control\n6. Garbage problem\n7. Energy and ecosystem conservation\n8. Pollution and destruction of ecosystem\n9. Restoration of polluted ecosystem","prerequisites":"- Students are expected to join discussion.\n- It is desirable to download handouts and summaries and to complete homework prior to every class. Completion of homework is not compulsory, but understanding the class is much harder if not.\n- Handing homework, comments, opinions, questions in at the end of every class is required.\n- Taking ecology and geochemistry is desirable.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts and summaries can be downloaded from \"moodle\".","assessment":"Score is evaluated based on examination at the end of the term.","message_from_instructor":"Humans are supported by two environments, i.e., society and nature. Since this viewpoint is lacked in almost environmental science, people cannot find out prospects and are confusing. I strongly expect students to be interested in structure of society causing environmental problems.","course_keywords":"ecosystem; material flow; ecological efficiency; ecosystem service; polluter pays principle; compartment model; tragedy of commons","office_hours":"10- 12 a.m., Monday","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/1/2018 10:58:01 AM","name":{"id":223,"ja":"生態系管理学","en":"Ecosystem Management"},"instructor":{"id":189,"ja":"多羅尾 光徳","en":"TARAO Mitsunori"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Fri.4","references":"E.P.
