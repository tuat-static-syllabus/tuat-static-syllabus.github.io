In this class, classification of pathogenic microorganisms, their nature and the life cycle, the invasive strategies of pathogens, and the defense strategies of the plants will be discussed. The relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and plants are also discussed followed by the discussion of the control of diseases based on the understanding of the relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and plants.\n\n[Overview] The major plant pathogenic microorganisms are filamentous fungus, bacteria, phytoplasma, nematodes, and viruses. In this lecture, mainly on fungi and bacteria, classification, morphology, physiology, life cycle and genetics are discussed. In addition, I will introduce the defense mechanisms to the pathogens in plants, strategies for pathogens to overcome the plants' defense. In addition, based on the understanding of the relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and plants, we will discuss on the possibility of controlling the diseases.","expected_learning":"Understanding of classification of pathogenic microorganisms, their nature and the life cycle, the invasive strategies of pathogens, the defense strategies of the plants, the relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and plants, and the control of diseases based on the understanding of the relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and plants is evaluated by the exam.","course_schedule":"Class plan:\n1, Introduction\n2, What are plant diseases; plant pathogenic microbes and the environment; classification of organisms\n3, What are fungi?; evolution and classification of fungi\n4, Nature of fungi; mating of fungi\n5, Fungal diseases caused by plasmoromycetes and oomycetes\n6, Fungal diseases caused by zygomycetes and basidiomycetes\n7, Fungal diseases caused by ascomycetes (and fungi inperfecti)\n8, What are bacteria?; general nature and classification of bacteria\n9, Bacterial and phytoplasima diseases\n10, Nematodes, protist, plant virus and viroid\n11, The relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and plants\n12, Control of plant diseases\n13, Post harvest diseases and mycotoxins\n14, test\n15, Overview of the test / Methodology in the study on plant pathogenic organisms","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"None","assessment":"valuates the number of times attendance + test results.\nHowever, to evaluate the D regardless of the test results if the attendance is less than 50%.\nI introduce the overview for the results of the test and evaluation of test points and evaluated in the last lecture.\n","message_from_instructor":"It is interesting disciplines of mutual relationship of two organisms pathogenic microorganisms - plant.
