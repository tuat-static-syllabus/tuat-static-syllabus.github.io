Participants will learn a series of flows that the difference in geology, topography and soil properties influences the water quality and that it also affects organisms in adjacent aquatic areas. Furthermore, various methods of biological / chemical researches and ecological conservation methods at the benthic boundary layer above the sediment / water column interface will be lectured.","expected_learning":"Students who successfully completed the course of this lecture,\n\n-are able to explain how “terrestrial soil” and “sediment in hydrosphere” are created, what kind of physicochemical features, and what kind of differences exist depending on the region and the ocean area.\n\n-are able to explain the role of the characteristics of terrestrial soil and marine sediments for the ecosystem and the material circulation in the atmosphere and hydrosphere.\n\n-are able to explain the studied topics to the general public in an easily understandable manner as outreach activity.\n","course_schedule":"The lecture content will change depending on the participants interests, and progress of the lectures, but the following topics will be lectured.\n1. Formation of rock strata, weathering of rock, formation of soils\n2. Influence of topography, geology and soil on river and groundwater quality\n3. Effects of river / groundwater quality on aquatic ecosystem\n4. Characteristics and survey methods of sediments in the hydrosphere.\n5. The role of aquatic sediment in material circulation and formation of hypoxic water mass\n6. Characteristics and evaluation of sinking particles in the hydrosphere\n7. Analysis of pollution history using sediments in the hydrosphere\n8. Function and conservation of benthic macrophyte (seagrasses, seaweeds, corals) ・ Blue carbon\n9. test","prerequisites":"This lecture is related to classes such as “Earth Science”, “Geochemistry”, “Freshwater Environment Studies”, “Environmental Soil Science”, “a\nAtmospheric Environmental Studies”, “Marine Environmental Studies”, and “Earth Environment Geology”.\n","texts_and_materials":"There is no text book, although it may be introduced during class as necessary. Supplementary documents will be distributed accordingly through the “moodle” system.","assessment":"Subjective & active participation to the class (ex., questions) is also considered in addition to final exams.","message_from_instructor":"I hope that this lecture will be useful for nurturing insight to understand the material circulation of the earth's surface layer. The contents of the lesson will be modified taking into consideration the content and knowledge of the other classes provided at TUAT. Please do positively ask questions using question cards or e-mails.","course_keywords":"Biosphere, Geographical geology, Terrestrial ecosystem, Lithosphere, Marine sediments, Biogeochemistry","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://yuumezawa.com/index.htm","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/26/2018 11:16:47 AM","name":{"id":229,"ja":"地圏環境学","en":"Terrestrial Environmental Sciences"},"instructor":{"id":223,"ja":"梅澤 有","en":"UMEZAWA Yu"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Mon.4","references":"Reference book will be instructed as necessary during class."}}
