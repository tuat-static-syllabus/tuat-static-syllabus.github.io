Chemosensory systems such as odorant, pheromone and taste receptions are closely related but a little bit different each other in using molecule and mechanisms of systems between mammals and insects. Students must understand current situation of scientific understanding of these matters.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"By Ryoichi Sato:\n1. Reason why infectious bacteria can infect and trigger disease to the host\n1) Toxin, Binding factor, invasive factor, anti-host defense factor\n2) Molecular structure, mode of action, and application of a molecular machine, BT insecticidal toxin\n2. Reason why animals can defend themselves from attacks by non-infectious microorganisms.\n1) Molecules consisting innate immunity, anti-microbial peptides and non-self recognition receptors.\n2) Mechanisms of protein specific binding to the ligands.\n3. Molecular mechanisms of odorant, pheromone and taste reception and their recognition.\n1) Molecular mechanisms of odorant and pheromone reception in mammals and insects.\n2) Molecular mechanisms of taste reception in mammals and insects.\n\nBy Takeshi Suzuki:\n1. Hierarchy of life\n1) International system of units (SI)\n2) Physical quantities\n2. Environmental responses\n1) Environmental responses in plants\n2) Environmental responses in animals\n3.
