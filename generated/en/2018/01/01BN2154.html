Students will also learn acid-base titration and redox titrimetry by measuring the content of acetic acid in vinegar and content of copper sulfate in unknown sample, respectively. The ultimate goal is to prepare students to acquire the knowledge on gravimetric analysis, principle of volumetric analysis, and learn/master how to use the lab ware.\nIn the part of basic organic chemistry, students will learn basic organic synthesis reaction as well as distillation, evaporation and thin-layer chromatography and ion-changing chromatography via the synthesis of acetanilide. In the part of biochemistry, students will get a knowledge on enzyme kinetics via enzymatic reaction using alkaline phosphatase.\n\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Text will be provided in class.
