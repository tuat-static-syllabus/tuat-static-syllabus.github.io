Nervous systems can detect the changes, communicate between neurons and output behaviors. The nervous systems also form highly integrative networks to memorize experimences and make a dicision on the basis of the memory. For students learning on biology and agricultural sciences, the knowledges on neural functions causing behaviors and physiological responses are required. In this class, I introduce mechanisms underlying the transportation of neural imformations by a single neuron or between neurons, and the highly integrative systems based on the neural circuits.\n\n","expected_learning":"(1) Describe the structure of a neuron and central nervous systems (2) Describe the conduction of action potentials within the neuron (3) Describe the transmission of neural information between neurons (4) Describe the changes of efficiency of synaptic transmission\n\n","course_schedule":"Week 1 Introduction to neurobiology: roles of nervous systems\nWeek 2 Structure of nervous systems: Tissue structure of central and peripheral nervous systems, structure of a neuron, molecules constructing a neuron\nWeek 3 Ion channels and states of a neuron 1: Resting potential, equilibrium potential\nWeek 4 Ion channels and states of a neuron 2: Excitation of a neuron, action potential\nWeek 5 Ion channels and states of a neuron 3: Conduction, refractory period\nWeek 6 Transmission of neural information 1: Structure of a synapse\nWeek 7 Transmission of neural information 2: Release and reception of neurotransmitters in a chemical synapse\nWeek 8 Transmission of neural information 3: Addition and subtraction of post-synaptic potentials\nWeek 9 Effectors: Structure of muscle, physiology of muscle contruction\nWeek 10 Sense organs: Cording of various physical stimuli\nWeek 11 Central nervous systems: Central pattern generators, innate behaviors, genetic factors\nWeek 12 Learning: Associative learning, morphologic changes of synaptic connection by learning\nWeek 13 Memory and sleeping: LTP, REM and non-REM sleeping\nWeek 14 Development of nervous systems: Neurogenesis and apoptosis\nWeek 15 Evloution of human brain: Large brain and environment surrounding human\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"No text books but distribute marerials for each lecture\n\n","assessment":"Evaluation on the basis of examination (60%), report(40%), attendance, questions and answers during lecture.　Scores in the last calss are S (28%), A (23%), B (28%), C (21%), D (0%), respectively.\n\n","message_from_instructor":"Requirements of neurobiology in life science are recognized as \"Brain science is a main research area in this century\".
