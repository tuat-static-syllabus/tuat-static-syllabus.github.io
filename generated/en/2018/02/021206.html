In this course, students will learn the most basic and minimum required knowledge for the coming chemistry study in the university through exercises solving. Students are strongly recommended to take the Basic Chemistry (Friday, 2nd period, #021205) in advance.\nEach lecture consists of brief explanation of chapters, quizzes and commentaries.\n","expected_learning":"(1) To understand the essence of the chemical phenomena, which are controlled by the characteristic of atoms and molecules, and the characteristic of the group of these particles\n(2) To understand the elementary quantum chemistry and periodic table\n(3) To understand that both chemical bonds and chemical reactions is related to electron transfer\n","course_schedule":"[Contents]\n1. Basic Atomic structure, Atomic weight and molar mass\n2. State of matter, Solution\n3. Acid-base reaction\n4. Oxidation-reduction reaction\n5. Atomic structure\nBohr theory, duality of electron\nHydrogen atom, atomic orbital\nOrbital energy, electron configuration\n6. Periodic table\nRelationship of atomic characteristics\nReactivity of element and character of compounds\n7. Molecular structure and its chemical bond\n8. Interaction\n\n[Tests]\nExam 1 for Content 1st to 4th\nExam 2 for Content 5th and 6th\nExam 3 for Content 7th and 8th\n\nThe use of electronic function calculator (non-graphing, non-programmable type) is permitted during the lectures and Exams.\n","prerequisites":"It is strongly recommended to take the course of the “Basic chemistry” (Friday, 2nd period, #021205).","texts_and_materials":"The teacher hands out the copies of quizzes each lecture.","assessment":"The overall course grade will be determined by records of attendance, quizzes, and results of Exams.","message_from_instructor":"Chemistry learning in a University is to understand the microscopic characteristics of each atom/molecule and the macroscopic behavior of assemblage formed by these particles. Please review high school chemistry as needed, and then attend a lesson.","course_keywords":"atom, molecule, acid-basic, oxidation-reduction, quantum theory, chemical bond, interaction","office_hours":"A/N, Teacher usually stays in the Advanced Capacitor Research Center.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/20/2018 11:06:27 AM","name":{"id":518,"ja":"化学基礎演習","en":"Basic Chemistry Exercise"},"instructor":{"id":482,"ja":"宮本 淳一","en":"MIYAMOTO Junichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"前学期","course_type":"前学期","facility_affiliation":"工学府","office":"","day_period":"水4","references":"JOHN McMURRY, ROBERT C.
