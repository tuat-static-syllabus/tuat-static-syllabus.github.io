The contents of each session are selected from fundamental molecular transformations of organic compounds. Lectures are also held four times during the course. Students should write the reports for each session. The lab session introduces the students to basic techniques and procedures used in the organic chemistry laboratory, e.g. isolation, purification, and characterization of organic compounds. The lectures deal with chemical properties of poisonous and deleterious substances, and hazardous materials, their proper management, and relevant laws.\nReading literature in English on organic syntheses and introducing recent topics in organic chemistry are also included as the lecture contents to develop an understanding of organic chemistry.\n","expected_learning":"A large number of organic substances are essential for our daily life. Although some of them can be available from nature, these are largely synthesized by the chemical reaction.\nUpon completion of this course, the students should be able to engage in safe laboratory practices by handling laboratory glassware, equipment, chemical reagents, and products appropriately through Lab session. The students will also have acquired a basic knowledge of synthetic method for organic compounds and ability to search for chemical and physical properties of reagents, starting materials, and products.\n","course_schedule":"(1) Course Guidance (1st day of this course): Course preview, safety, and general information, Checking equipment in a storage box which you will be responsible for during the lab course.\n(2) Lecture 1: Management of Chemical Reagents and Solvents (Poisonous Materials)\n(3) Lecture 2: Brief Explanation of How to Use Lab Equipment and How to Write Reports\n(4) Laboratory Sessions\nThe following six laboratory experiments will be conducted.\ni) Reduction: Preparation of benzyl alcohol by the reaction of benzaldehyde with sodium borohydride and its qualitative identification\nii) Photochromism: Preparation of spiropyran and its photochromism and kinetics\niii) Oxidation: Preparation of cyclohexanone by the reaction of cyclohexanol with sodium hypochlorite and its qualitative identification\niv) Aromatic Nucleophilic Substitution: Preparation of methyl 3-nitrobenzoate by nitration of methyl benzoate with mixed acid\nv) Nucleophilic Addition to a Carbonyl: Cannizzaro reaction of benzaldehyde, separation of products by acid-base extraction, and its identification with Thin Layer Chromatography\nvi) Polymer Synthesis: Preparation of poly(methyl methacrylate) by radical polymerization and polyamides by interfacial polymerization, dyeing with Orange II, and discussion about the stereoregularity.\n(5) Clean-up and Equipment Check-out\n(6) Lecture 3: Reading Literature in English on Organic Syntheses\n(7) Lecture 4: Title TBD\n","prerequisites":"Students entering this class should carry the disaster and accident insurance for student education and research.\nStudents may not work in the Lab without complete compliance with the safety policy, which will be announced at the course guidance (1st day) in detail. They must wear approved lab coats with a name tag and safety goggles (or glasses) in the lab at all times. Wearing contact lenses in the lab is prohibited. Shoes that expose any part of the foot are strictly prohibited in the lab.\n","texts_and_materials":"The Original textbook ed. by our department for lab courses. You have already purchased this text in the freshman year.\nAdditional documents may be used if necessary. They will be given in the course guidance.\n","assessment":"Your grade will be determined largely by a total score of report points and attendance points. Your attitude in the laboratory will also be considered. You are expected to attend the course guidance and all lectures and laboratory sessions to pass the course.\nUnexcused absences, late arrivals and late submitting and/or missing reports may result in a failing grade.\n","message_from_instructor":"The experiments in this course are selected to be performed readily and safely under consideration that you are unfamiliar with organic laboratory practice. Before you come to lab, you should read the textbook carefully and understand the procedure and reactions used in the lab session each time to prevent the accident, e.g. burns, cuts, fires, and chemical spills. An approved lab coat, safety goggle (or glass), and closed-toe shoes must be worn in the lab. Never endanger the safety of yourself or others for any reason.","course_keywords":"Organic Chemistry, Molecular Transformation, Experimental Procedure, Extraction, Recrystallization","office_hours":"A/N; Contact information will be shown in the handout distributed at the course guidance.","remarks_1":"1) All reports should be submitted to the report box by the deadline listed in the lab schedule, usually by 8:40 AM.\n2) Attendance will be taken at 1:00 PM at all laboratory classes.\n","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/23/2018 7:31:21 PM","name":{"id":617,"ja":"応用分子化学実験Ⅱ","en":"Molecular Chemistry Experiments Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":598,"ja":"坪内 彰","en":"TSUBOUCHI Akira"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Mon.3～5,Tue.3～5","references":"Reference books useful for understanding the experiments scheduled in this course and for analyzing the data obtained can be available in our University Library.\nOrganic Chemistry ed. by J.
