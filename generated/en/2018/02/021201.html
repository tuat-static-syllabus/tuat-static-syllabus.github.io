In Universities, interdisciplinary studies of those fields are necessary to learn science. This course is designed for you to experience topics of science by conducting experiments, which cover diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, informatics, security, and environments. You learn how to develop your specialties with broad views through performing the experiments by own thoughts.","expected_learning":"We expect you all to learn to\n(1) Understand principles of the experiments.\n(2) Appropriately conduct the experiments from comprehension of purposes and methods of the experiments.\n(3) Analyze experimental data and make reasonable conclusions.\n(4) Lead scientific discussion from the experimental results.\n(5) Write your reports of the above items.","course_schedule":"(Temporally)\n#1 Orientations of \"Information processing\" and \"Handling of scientific information\"\n(#1 is held at the first semester.)\n#2 Guidance of \"Basic Experiments for Scientific Studies\" and \"Safe operation of experiments\"\n#3 How to write an experimental report and guidance for experiments 1-3\n#4 Experiment 1 Handling of laboratory instruments and lecture of glasswork\n#5 Experiment 2 Nucleophilic substitution reaction\n#6 Experiment 3 Qualitative analysis of inorganic ions\n#7 Basic seminar 1 and 2\n#8 Guidance for experiments 4-7 and study of research ethics\n#9 Experiment 4 Plastic cell\n#10 Experiment 5 DNA analysis\n#11 Experiment 6 Processing of experimental results (Group 1)/Measurement of acceleration of gravity (Group 2) The registered students are divided into two groups, Group 1 and 2\n#12 Experiment 7 Measurement of acceleration of gravity (Group 1)/Processing of experimental results (Group 2)\n#13 Basic seminar 3\n#14 Basic seminar 4","prerequisites":"Students entering this class are assumed to have had a high school experimental knowledge.","texts_and_materials":"Experimental text FY2015 edition, which can be bought at the first class of the second semester (#2).","assessment":"Total evaluation of \"attendance\", \"homework\", \"reports\" and \"experiment participation\".
