Various knowledge and know-how are required to scale up and develop large scale production system. The main purpose of this lecture is to give the basic knowledges for it. The lectures include characteristics of microbes or cells to fluid dynamics. We also instruct the examples of practical production of various bioproducts. In addition, we will some lectures on structures of proteins, genome analysis technology, microTAS and genome editing.\n","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1 Apr 16 Research on proteins and biopharmaceuticals\n2 Apr 23 Secondary structure of protein\n3 Apr 30 Kinetics of cell reactions\n4 May 7 Immobilize biocatalyst and bioreactor\n5 May 14 Ternary structure of protein (1)\n6 May 21 Ternary structure of Protein (2)\n7 May 28 MicroTAS and application for biotechnology\n8 June 4 Basics of BioMEMS and MEMS\n9 June 11 Basics of Microfluidics\n10 June 18 Application of BioMEMS\n11 June 25 Basics of Development\n12 July 2　Genetically modified animals (1) Homologous recombination\n13 July 9 Genetically modified animals (2) Genome editing\n14 July 16 Genome analysis technologies\n15 July 23 Application of genetically modified animals","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/3/2018 5:52:08 PM","name":{"id":725,"ja":"バイオプロセスエンジニアリング","en":"Bioprocess Engineering"},"instructor":{"id":683,"ja":"養王田 正文, 野口 恵一, 川野 竜司, 篠原 恭介","en":"YOHDA Masafumi, NOGUCHI Keiichi, KAWANO Ryuji, SHINOHARA Kyosuke"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Mon.1","references":""}}
