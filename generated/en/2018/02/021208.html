Through a lecture series [organic chemistry I－III], students in division of applied chemistry systematically learn the basics of organic chemistry, which is designed to build up foundations for chemical research in academics and industries. As an introductory part of the series, this lecture aims to understand important and common concepts of organic chemistry.\n\nOutline: This lecture covers molecular orbital, covalent bond, resonance, acid/base, functional group, IUPAC nomenclature, molecular interactions towards understandings of properties and structures of organic molecules. The main topics includes organic chemistry of alkane and alkene, concepts for stereochemistry and chirality to foster the ability to consider three-dimensional structure of molecules. Explanation of reaction mechanisms indicating movements of paired electron using a curved arrow will provide methods of understanding for conversions of organic molecules.\n","expected_learning":"It is required to understand such fundamental issues studies at lectures as acidity and alkanes, alkenes, stereochemistry, and so on.","course_schedule":"1.
