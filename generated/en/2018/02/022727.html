These are fundamental as a engineer in the field of electrical and electronic engineering.","expected_learning":"By 6 subjects, we expect you all to learn to\n(1) Understand principles of the experiments and conduct.\n(2) Record and analyze the experimental data appropriately by your notes.\n(3) Make reasonable conclusions, and lead scientific discussion from the experimental results.\n(4) Write your reports of the above items according to the appropriate format.\n","course_schedule":"The experiment includes the following 6 subjects.\n1. Fundamental of logic circuits.\n2. Observation of electrical signals by oscilloscope.\n3. Wiring of electrical elements. Design and measurement of electrical amplifier with frequency dependence.\n4. Principle of electrical circuits, filters, resonance\n5. Magnetic field by coil\n6. Electrical field and potential\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Given in the first week.","assessment":"Caution:\nWhen one meets any of the following conditions, the course grade is evaluated as “D” (Failure) automatically.\n1. Absence without any appropriate reasons (including the orientations)\n2. Repeated lateness\n3. Less participation in the experiments\n4. Violation of safety rules\n5. Failure of submitting all reports\n6. Extreme delay for report submission deadlines\n7. Disobeying other prohibited matters described in the instruction text\nThe detail is explained at the first orientation.\n","message_from_instructor":"Experiment course is integrated course of science. The registered students should understand backgrounds and theories of each experiment by reading the instruction text and other supplementary materials in prior work, participate in the experiments, and submit reports of the corresponding experiments.
