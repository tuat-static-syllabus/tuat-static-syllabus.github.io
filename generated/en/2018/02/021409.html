Background and importance of “Chemical Engineering”\n1.1. History of Chemical Engineering\n(1) Haber-Bosch process (Method of directly synthesizing ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen)\n(2) Gasoline production process\n1.2. Four important “Pollution-related illnesses” in Japan and the contribution of separation process on the solution of this subjects\n(1) Minamata disease : mercury\n(2) Niigata Minamata disease : mercury\nMercury is highly volatile element, still difficult subjects to separate from flue gas. New production process for NaOH without mercury were developed.\n(3) Itai-itai disease : Cadmium emission, Cd ion in sewer water and dust emission\n(4) Asthma in Yokkaichi : Sulfite gas, Nitrogen oxide and dust, fine particles\nNew Environmental subjects\n\n2. New technology about separation from polluted water and gas\n1) Liquid-liquid extraction, emulsion dispersion (oil in water, water/oil/water)\n2) Adsorption, Zeolite and other adsorbed material (ferrocyanide)\nExample, Fukusima radioactive material Cesium\nEnvironmental standard = 5000 becquerel : the number of atoms / second\n\n3. New concepts for chemical production process engineering,\n/ Closed systems\nSeparation and recycling of unreacted raw feedstock\n/ Zero emission\nl, aggregation and sedimentation etc.\n\n4.
