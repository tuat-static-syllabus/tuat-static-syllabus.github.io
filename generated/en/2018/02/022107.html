It is divided into catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism is the set of metabolic pathways that breaks down molecules into smaller units that are either oxidized to release energy or used in other anabolic reactions. Anabolism is the set of metabolic pathways that construct molecules from smaller units. In this lecture, you will manly study anabolism.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1 Apr 10 Introduction\n2 Apr 17 The Calvin Cycle\n3 Apr 24 The Pentose Phosphate Pathway\n4 May 1 Glycogen Metabolism\n5 May 8 Fatty Acid Metabolism\n6 May 15 Protein Turnover\n7 May 22 Amino Acid Catabolism\n8 May 29 TBA\n9 June 5 Nucleotide Biosynthesis\n10 June 12 The Biosynthesis of Amino Acids\n11 June 19 The Biosynthesis of Membrane Lipids and Steroids\n12 June 26 TBA\n13 July 3 Mechanism of Olfaction\n14 July 10 TBA\n15 July 17 TBA","prerequisites":"\"Basic physics\", \"Basic chemistry\", \"Basic biology\" and \"Biochemistry I\" are prerequisites.","texts_and_materials":"Biochemistry (Stryker)","assessment":"End of term exam: 60%.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/3/2018 4:57:24 PM","name":{"id":588,"ja":"生命化学Ⅱ","en":"Biochemistry Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":577,"ja":"養王田 正文","en":"YOHDA Masafumi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Tue.2","references":""}}
