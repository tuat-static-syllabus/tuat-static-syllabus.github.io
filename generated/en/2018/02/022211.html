Students will learn the handling of experimental instruments and the experimental skill to obtain a precise measurement results as well as the handing of error and significant digits through the analytical experiments. Students also synthesize metal-organic framework/porous coordination polymer as inorganic material synthesis. Students discuss their progress and write formal reports. The course is suitable for students with or without extensive laboratory experience.","expected_learning":"Upon completion of this course, students will have acquired the fundamentals of Inorganic and analytical chemistry experiments.","course_schedule":"Eight themes shown below will be performed in molecular chemistry experiments I. The detail of the experimental schedule will be announced in the course guidance.\n1. Exercise of statistical processing\n2. Exercise of molecular model\n3. Gravimetric analysis\n4. Redox titration\n5. Neutralization titration\n6. Electrochemical measurement\n7. Compleximetric titration\n8. Synthesis of metal-organic framework/porous coordination polymer","prerequisites":"Students entering this class should carry the student disaster and accident insurance for education and research. Students may not work in the Lab without complete compliance with the safety policy, which will be announced at the course guidance (1st day) in detail. You must wear approved lab coats with a name tag and safety goggles (or glasses) in the lab at all times. Shoes that expose any part of the foot is strictly prohibited in the lab.","texts_and_materials":"Original textbook ed. by our department for lab courses. You have already purchased this text at freshmen grade.","assessment":"Your grade will be determined mainly by a total score of report points and attendance points. Your attitude in the laboratory will also be considered. You are expected to attend the course guidance and all lectures and laboratory sessions to pass the course.\nIf you have unexcused absences, arriving to class late, and late and/or missing reports, you may not receive a passing grade.\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Experiment, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"1) All reports should be submitted to the report box by the deadline listed in the lab schedule, usually by 8:40 AM.\n2) Attendance will be taken at 1:00 PM at all laboratory classes.\n","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/22/2018 11:47:10 AM","name":{"id":608,"ja":"応用分子化学実験Ⅰ","en":"Molecular Chemistry Experiments Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":593,"ja":"近藤 篤, 小峰 伸之, 岩間 悦郎","en":"KONDO Atsushi, KOMINE Nobuyuki, IWAMA Etsuro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Mon.3～5,Tue.3～5","references":"Reference books useful for understanding the experiments scheduled in this course and for analyzing the data obtained can be available in our University Library."}}
