First, you learn the current. Next, you learn the magnetic field generated by the current and the magnet, and also the electromagnetic induction phenomenon. The electromagnetism, which begins with the Coulomb force acting between the point charges, develops greatly to the classical \"field\" physics of electric and magnetic fields. The culmination is Maxwell's equations, and electromagnetic waves are derived from them. Knowledge of the principle and essence of electromagnetics is indispensable as basic knowledge when engaging in science and technology in the future.","expected_learning":"Understand the current and magnetic flux density and the laws related thereto (Biot-Savart's law, Ampere's law, Fleming's law, Lenz's law, Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, etc.).\nUnderstand the physical meaning of Maxwell's equations.","course_schedule":"1　Electric current (flow of electron, current density, Ohm's law, electric resistance)\n2　Magnetic Field (magnetic field and electric field, magnetic dipole, magnetic flax density)\n3　Magnetic Flax Density(1) (Biot-Savart's law, Ampere's law, vector potential)\n4　Magnetic Flax Density(2)（how to calculation of the magnetic flax density）\n5　Magnetic Effect of Current(1) (Fleming's law）\n6　Magnetic Effect of Current(2) (Lorent's law)\n7　Magnetism（magnetization、diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism)\n8　Examination(1)\n9　Electromagnetic Induction (Lenz's law, Faraday's law)\n10　Inductance(1) (self-inductance, mutual inductance)\n11　Inductance(2) (energy of magnetic field, circuit containing resistance and inductance)\n12　Maxwell's equations(1) (displacement current、Maxwell's equations）\n13　Maxwell's equations(2) (plane electromagnetic wave)\n14　Maxwell's equations(3) (wave function、energy of electromagnetic wave, electromagnetic wave in materials)\n15　Examination(2)","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Ampere's law、Faraday's law、Maxwell's equations、Electromagnetic Wave","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"8/17/2018 3:52:56 PM","name":{"id":603,"ja":"電磁気学Ⅱ","en":"Electromagnetics Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":535,"ja":"香取 浩子","en":"KATORI Hiroko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Mon.2","references":""}}
