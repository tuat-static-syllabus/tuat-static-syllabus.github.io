You will learn fundamental skills and knowledge about inorganic analytical chemistry through the experiments.\n[Experiments of Physics]\nFrom these experiments, you will learn basal knowledge of physical chemistry and experimental technique about material science.\n","expected_learning":"[Experiments of Inorganic Analytical Chemistry]\nYou will learn preparation and arrangement for experiments/writing an experimental log/ data acquisition/discussing the results/writing an experimental report/calibration of glassware/significant figure and experimental error.\n[Experiments of Physics]\nEspecially, you will learn about making of experimental reports which are emphasized an analysis of experimental results and comprehensive discussion. We will equip you with method of calculation of experimental error and quotation of references in experimental reports.\n","course_schedule":"[Experiments of Inorganic Analytical Chemistry]\n1. Safety training and writing experimental reports.\n2. Physical quantity, SI units, and significant figure.\n3. Volumetric Analysis: Learning basic methods of chemical experiments.\n4. Calibration of glassware used in titration: Understanding an importance of systematic error on measurement experiments through drawing the calibration curves of burettes and pipettes.\n5. Neutralization titration curves: Understanding a principle about ionic equilibria in solutions.\n6. Colorimetric analysis: Determining a concentration of copper sulfate solution. Understanding significance of calibration curves and the least-squares method with the results of the visible absorption spectroscopy.\n7. Ion exchange and chelatometric titration: Determining a concentration of copper sulfate solution. Function of an ion exchange resin and chelating agent is understood.\n[Experiments of Physics]\nOrientation and safe training + seminar about experiments + experiments as follows;\n1. Simple harmonic oscillation (Examining spring constant and elastic strain energy of spring from an observation of simple harmonic oscillation of spring)\n2. Coupling pendulum (You will learn a theory of coupled vibration from connected two simple pendulum)\n3. Resonance of air core (You will examine about a wave motion from measurement of their frequency)\n4. Direct current (DC) circuit measurement (You will learn basal technique about measurement of voltage, current, and resistance)\n5. Alternating current (AC) circuit measurement (You will learn phase and complex notation on AC circuit)\n6. Dielectric (You will learn a relationship between molecular structure, mobility and dielectric constant)\n","prerequisites":"[Experiments of Inorganic Analytical Chemistry]\nInorganic chemistry, Analytical chemistry\n[Experiments of Physics]\nBasic physics and seminar (Ⅰ,Ⅱ), Dynamics, Oscillation, and electrodynamics\n","texts_and_materials":"Original textbooks made by department","assessment":"Experimental reports, the percentage of attendance, attitude, and depth of understanding.
