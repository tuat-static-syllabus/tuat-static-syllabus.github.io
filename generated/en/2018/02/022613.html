Sets and maps, the direct product of sets (pp.8-16)\n2. Surjections and injections, the definition of algebraic systems (pp.15-18, p.22)\n3. Equivalent relations and quotient sets (pp.19-20)\n4. Semigroups and groups, examples of groups (pp.23-27, pp.44-48)\n5. Subgroups, cyclic groups, equivalent relations induced by subgroups (pp.27-29, p.42)\n6. Normal subgroups and quotient groups (p.28, pp.40-42 except for homomorphisms)\n7. Homomorphisms and isomorphisms of groups, the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms (pp.36-42)\n8. Exercises I\n9. Rings and fields (pp.30-34)\n10. Ideals of rings and quotient rings (pp.50-54)\n11. Euclidean algorism and the inverse of an integer modulo n (pp.69-74)\n12.
