Students who successfully complete this class will be able to determine the molecular structures by a combination of these spectroscopic approaches.","expected_learning":"Students who successfully complete this class will be able to understand the principle of the MS, IR, and NMR spectrometers.\nMoreover, students are able to learn the molecular identifying method using each spectrometry.\n","course_schedule":"Week 1; Introduction\nWeek 2; 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance(NMR)-1\nWeek 3; 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance(NMR)-2\nWeek 4; 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance(NMR)-1\nWeek 5; 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance(NMR)-2\nWeek 6; 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance(NMR)-3\nWeek 7; mid-term exams\nWeek 8; Mass spectrometry (MS)-1\nWeek 9; Mass spectrometry (MS)-2\nWeek 10; Mass spectrometry (MS)-3\nWeek 11; Infrared spectroscopy (IR)-1\nWeek 12; Infrared spectroscopy (IR)-2\nWeek 13; Review and practice -1\nWeek 14; Review and practice -2\nWeek 15; Final exam","prerequisites":"None","texts_and_materials":"No particular text.
