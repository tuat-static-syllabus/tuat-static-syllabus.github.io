It is a basic science to understand life. Whole life ( Animals, Plants, Microbes ) consists of cell(s). The cell activities are important to maintain life, those contain taking nutrition, excretion of wastes, intracellular metabolism and cell-cell communication. Those phenomena are able to understand by chemistry. In this lecture, the metabolic pathways of four kinds of basic contents in the cell are learned. You can understand the way of gaining the energy and the nutrition.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this lecture will be able to\n1.Know the basic of metabolism and functions of enzymes\n2.Understand and lead the equation of enzyme kinetics by yourself\n3.Notice the roll of each metabolic pathway and those networks\nReview the lecture as soon as possible is important to understand this subject rather than preparation.","course_schedule":"1st lecture ( Oct. 1 ): Guidance about this lecture, short examination for review of the first semester\n2nd lecture ( Oct. 8 ): Membrane transport ( Passive-mediated transport : ionophores, porins & ion channels, Active transport : ATP-dependent transporters & secondary active-transporters )\n3rd lecture ( Oct. 15 ): General properties of Enzymes ( important respects, specificity, types of cofactors, reaction coordinate )\n4th lecture ( Oct. 22 ): Enzyme kinetics I ( Michaelis-Menten equation, assumption of steady state, Lineweaver-Burk(double-reciprocal) plot, catalytic efficiency, turnover number )\n5th lecture ( Oct. 29 ): Enzyme kinetics II ( Enzyme inhibition : competitive inhibition, uncompetitive inhibition & mixed(noncompetitive) inhibition, Control of enzyme activity : allosteric effectors & covalent modification )\n6th lecture ( Nov. 5 ): Metabolism ( rolls of high-energy compounds & electron carriers ), Glycolysis ( overview )\n7th lecture ( Nov. 12 ): Citric acid cycle ( overview, cataplerotic reactions, anaplerotic reactions )\n8th lecture ( Nov. 19 ): Midsemester examination\n9th lecture ( Nov. 26 ): Electron transport and Oxidative phosphorylation ( the mitochondrion, overview of electron transport chain, energy coupling, chemiosomotic theory )\n10th lecture ( Dec. 3 ): Pentose phosphate pathway ( overview, two aims of this pathway )\n11th lecture ( Dec. 10 ): Photosynthesis I ( the chloroplast, the light reactions )\n12th lecture ( Dec. 17 ): Photosynthesis II ( the dark reactions(Calvin cycle), C4 cycle )\n13th lecture ( Jan. 7 ): Lipid metabolism I ( lipid digestion, absorption and transport in human, fatty acid oxidation )\n14th lecture ( Jan. 21 ): Lipid metabolism II ( fatty acid biosynthesis )\n15th lecture ( Jan. 28 ): Final exams\nThis program is tentative plan.
