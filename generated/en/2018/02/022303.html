In this lecture, we will study the basic programming methods and their applications to the scientific and engineering calculations. At each lectures, students will make easy programs for a better understanding. The programming language used in this lecture is C and C++, but no preliminary knowledge about programming is necessary.","expected_learning":"(1) Understanding of the fundamental programming technique.\n(2) Students can make programs which use the selection statements and iteration statements.\n(3) Students can create easy application programs on science or engineering.\n","course_schedule":"[Part 1] Fundamentals of programming methods\n(Lesson 1) Guidance\n(Lesson 2) Framework of C programs, primitive data types, console input-output\n(Lesson 3) Mathematical functions, easy numerical calculations\n(Lesson 4) Selection statements (if statements)\n(Lesson 5) Iteration statements (for, while statements)\n(Lesson 6) Arrays\n(Lesson 7) Functions and classes (1)\n(Lesson 8) Strings\n(Lesson 9) Functions and classes (2)\n[Part 2] Application of programming\n(Lesson 10) Random numbers - Application to stochastic phenomenon\n(Lesson 11) Differential equations - Application to motion or diffusion\n(Lesson 12) Integration - Application to Maxwell distribution\n(Lesson 13) Application to various problems (No.1)\n(Lesson 14) Application to various problems (No.2)\n(Lesson 15) Examination\n","prerequisites":"A laptop / notebook computer is necessary","texts_and_materials":"None","assessment":"Examination (50%), Report (30%), Exercise (20%),\n2015 S 32%, A 23%, B 30%, C 15%, D 0%\n2016 S 22%, A 24%, B 34%, C 15%, D 5%\n2017 S 31%, A 19%, B 27%, C 23%, D 0%\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"computer, programming, numerical calculation, algorithm, simulation","office_hours":"After lecture time","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/27/2018 3:11:19 PM","name":{"id":576,"ja":"プログラミング基礎","en":"Fundamentals of Computer Programming"},"instructor":{"id":599,"ja":"三浦 俊明","en":"MIURA Toshiaki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Wed.2","references":"None"}}
