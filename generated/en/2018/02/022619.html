In the end of the 19th century, it had been believed that physics would have been completed by mechanics by Newton, electromagnetism by Maxwell, thermal physics by Boltzmann, and so on. But many experimental results, which could not be understood by such classical physics, were found one after another in the late 19th century. After enormous struggles and trial-and-errors, these strange experimental results had eventually been understood systematically by quantum mechanics. It took 50 years (1875-1925) to build up a new paradigm of physics. This lecture look back to how quantum mechanics was born. First the essence of \"analytical dynamics\", which bridges classical and quantum mechanics, is briefly introduced. Next classical physics For example \"equipartition law of energy\", one monumental law of classical thermal physics, fails in some cases for gas molecules, light (electromagnetic wave), etc.. In order to solve this failure, Max Planck proposed quantization of energy in 1900 while Einstein proposed the hypothesis of light quanta. Subsequently Niels Bohr stepped forward to new mechanics in 1913, based on the quantization of the electron orbit in hydrogen, which is known as \"old quantum theory\". These series of new ideas will be overviewed in the lecture. The development of quantum mechanics had been accomplished in 1925-26, by the two theories: Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Schrodinger's wave mechanics. In the lecture, you also learn how these seemingly distant theories are related and how they were reached.","expected_learning":"Students are expected to learn\n1. developments of physics in 1875-1925.\n2. fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.\n3. basic ideas for electron, atom, and nucleus\n","course_schedule":"I.
