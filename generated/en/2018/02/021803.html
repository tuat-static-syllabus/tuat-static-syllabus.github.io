In this course, we will learn the differentiations and the integrations of various functions of one variable and their properties. We will practice advanced computations in this course rather than in high schools.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiations and the integrations of various functions, such as polynomials, rational and irrational functions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions,\n(2) to understand how to calculate extreme maximal and minimum values of functions, and\n(3) to be capable of performing practical computations on determining areas of figures and lengths of curves.","course_schedule":"1. Real numbers\n2. Continuous functions\n3. Elementary functions\n4. Limit\n5. Differentiations of functions\n6. The mean-value theorem\n7. Exercise 1\n8. Midterm examination\n9. Higher order derivatives\n10. Taylor's theorem\n11. Indefinite integrals and definite integrals\n12. Calculation of integrals\n13. Improper integrals\n14. Piecewise quadrature method and application of definite integrals\n15. Exercise 2\n\nA common examination will be conducted extra at the last of the term in the adjustment period for all the classes of this course.","prerequisites":"Mathematics in high schools (in particular, Mathematics Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ etc.) will be used in the lecture.","texts_and_materials":"Miyake, Toshitsune (1992) Nyumon Bibunsekibun, Baifukan","assessment":"Midterm examination (40％)，Final examination (40％)，Exercises (20％)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Differentiation, Taylor expansion, Limit of indeterminate form, Integration of rational function, Improper integral","office_hours":"15:00-16:00 on Friday, Room 213, Building 12, Koganei Campus","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/19/2018 11:00:21 AM","name":{"id":506,"ja":"微分積分学Ⅰおよび演習","en":"Calculus Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":472,"ja":"村田 実貴生","en":"MURATA Mikio"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"Room 213, Building 12, Koganei","day_period":"Wed.1～2","references":""}}
