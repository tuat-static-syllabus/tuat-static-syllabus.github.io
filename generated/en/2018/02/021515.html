For that purpose, firstly we will learn basic gate circuit operation and combinatorial logic circuit combining them. Furthermore, after studying the concept of information storage by flip-flop circuit, learning the interface and other interface such as AD, DA conversion essential to control of counter and register as its application, learning about computer structure and its operation To do.","expected_learning":"(1) Understand the vector representation of the moment of force and the calculation method by cross product, and analyze the rotation action acting in three dimensional space.\n(2) It is possible to understand the relevance between the center of gravity and the center of gravity and to find the position of the center of gravity of a complex shape 2D / 3D object.\n(3) Understand the principle of virtual work and apply it to derive the relationship of multiple forces acting","course_schedule":"(1)Introduction\n(2)Unit system\n(3)Static point of mass point (2Dplane)\n(4)Static point of mass point (3Dspace)\n(5)Rigid body dynamics\n(6)Balance of force working on the rigid body\n(7)Distributed force (2Dplane)\n(8)Distribution force (3Dspace)\n(9)Structure Analysis 1\n(10)Structure Analysis 2\n(11)Beam, the force acting on the cable\n(12)Friction\n(13)Centroid and moment of inertia\n(14)Virtual Work Principle\n(15)Summary","prerequisites":"Knowledge of the dynamics and vectors of physics learned in high school.\nIt is the basis of subjects of mechanical system motion, analysis and design.","texts_and_materials":"Use text to sell at co-op.

Since you will learn essential knowledge to deal with complex problems of three dimensions, please come to class and be sure to understand. Stacking and exercises are important for dynamics. It is useful for asking questions yourself, listening frequently to the questions others ask, and discussing again. Please deepen your understanding through this lesson.","course_keywords":"Mass point, rigid body equilibrium, vector, center of gravity, moment","office_hours":"Room6-208, Contact via e-mail at mwada@cc.tuat.ac.jp before visit","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/17/2018 4:39:10 PM","name":{"id":546,"ja":"静力学","en":"Statics"},"instructor":{"id":522,"ja":"和田 正義","en":"WADA Masayoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Mon.3","references":"Mechanics for engineering by Bear Johnston (1)\nMechanics general such as Maruzen General"}}
