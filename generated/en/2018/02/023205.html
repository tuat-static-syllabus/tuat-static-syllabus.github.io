This course deals with crystal structures of inorganic solids, which are important to understand physical properties of inorganic solids, and explain various physical and chemical properties of inorganic solids based on concrete examples of representative materials.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to understand crystal structures of representative inorganic solids and fundamental physical and chemical properties of inorganic solids mainly based on their crystal and defect structures .","course_schedule":"Week 1: Course guidance\nFundamentals of crystal structure 1 (close packing structures, symmetry, unit cell) - Chapter 1\nWeek 2: Fundamentals of crystal structure 2 (types of crystals, crystal structure, use of crystal structure visualization softwares) - Chapter 1\nWeek 3: Representative crystal structures 1 (AB type and AB2 type structures) - Chap. 1\nWeek 4: Representative crystal structures 2 (structures of important oxides) - Chap. 1\nWeek 5: Imperfect structures (defects, amorphous solids)- Chap. 2\nWeek 6: Electronic structures (molecular orbital theory, band theory) - Chap. 3\nWeek 7: Electric properties 1 (electronic conductivity, superconductivity) - Chap. 4\nWeek 8: Electric properties 2 (ionic conductivity) - Chap. 4\nWeek 9: Electric properties 3 (electronic properties) - Chap. 5\nWeek 10: Magnetic properties 1 (behavior of materials in magnetic field) - Chap. 6\nWeek 11: Magnetic properties 2 (representative magnetic materials and their crystal structures) - Chap. 6\nWeek 12: Optical properties 1 refraction, (reflection, absorption and emission of light, phosphors) - Chap. 7\nWeek 13: Optical properties 2 (laser, other optical properties) - Chap. 7\nWeek 14: Properties of low-dimensional materials and nanomaterials (intercalation, surface properties) - Chap. 10, 14 & handout\nWeek 15: Term-end exam","prerequisites":"Students entering this class are desired to have learned Inorganic Chemistry I & II, Physical Chemistry III or their equivalents. Furthermore, fundamental understanding of Electromagnetics are also preferable.

Details on the midterm report will be explained during the course. Students are allowed to bring a handwritten double sided A4 material at the term-end exam .","message_from_instructor":"Other courses related to organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry mainly deal with molecular compounds, and their basic reactivities and physical properties may be predicted according to their molecular structures. Meanwhile, it is known that inorganic solids, even very fundamental materials such as silica and alumina, often have various different structures, resulting in considerably different physical properties. Even the same crystal structures may show different physical properties resulting from their defect structure and nanostructure. This course starts from understanding crystal structures of inorganic solids and afterward presents factors governing various physical and chemical properties of inorganic solids.","course_keywords":"inorganic materials, crystal structure, physical and chemical properties of solids","office_hours":"Prof. Kazuyuki Maeda (Building 1: N413) Anytime","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"See Moodle page of this course (in Japanese)","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/24/2018 1:39:47 PM","name":{"id":738,"ja":"物性化学","en":"Materials Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":485,"ja":"前田 和之","en":"MAEDA Kazuyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Fri.1","references":"A.
