We are going to study current, magnetic field / vector magnetic potential by current including their relationship, and steady magnetic field. Then we are going to study time-varying field (electromagnetic induction and displacement current), and electromagnetic waves. Finally, Maxwell’s equations are derived. Practices are included for better understanding.","expected_learning":"You will be able to understand steady magnetic field in Electromagnetism. Then, you will be able to calculate the magnetic field and vector magnetic potential by current, and understand the fundamental principle of steady magnetic field.
