In this lecture, for the improvement of a reading comprehension ability of English articles and presentation skills, it is required every time to make a presentation of the contents understood from an English article as an assignment. It should be noted that particles go into a small group and attend a lecture of a different teaching stuff every week. Particles must receive an article before two weeks of each lecture and do preparation to give a full presentation. In some cases, submission of the summary is required in advance.","expected_learning":"It is required to understand the English article from the viewpoint of chemistry.","course_schedule":"[1st Lecture] Explanation of this lecture (aim, procedure, grouping, schedule, and so on)\n[2nd?6th Lecture (intensive course)] Attending in the progress report of graduation work: a research content of laboratory can be learned. It is desirable to debate with teaching stuff and/or senior students. The schedule time is separately configured as an intensive course.\n[7th?13th Lecture] Group learning: a presentation of the contents understood from an English article as an assignment is made. Teaching stuff checks the student's comprehension of the article through a question and answer. Background of researches and expressive style of English articles can be learned.\n[14th Lecture] Explanation of graduation work: how to assign to laboratory groups.\n[15th Lecture] Meeting for the placement of graduation work: the placement will be determined.\n","prerequisites":"It is desirable to take the general chemistry course.","texts_and_materials":"The assignment must be received from each teaching stuff before two weeks of each lecture.","assessment":"Particles are assessed from 1) attitude in lectures, 2) comprehension and 3) achievement of the assignments.","message_from_instructor":"In this lecture, particles go into a small group (5?7 persons) and attend a lecture of a different teaching stuff every week. There is no sense of only translating the English article into Japanese. It is crucial to understand contents of the English article from the associated textbooks and/or references. On this occasion, learn to read and understand the English article better.
