Aim: Organic Chemistry is important not only as a basis of organic synthesis but also all the science and technology concerning organic materials which include metabolic biotransformation and electronic property of organic molecules. Organic Chemistry II is a part of Organic Chemistry course which consists of Organic Chemistry I ? IV. Organic Chemistry course aims at understanding of fundamentals of organic chemistry.\n\nb. Outline: In this lecture, the structures, properties, and reactivity of alkenes, alkynes, alkyl halides, conjugated dienes, and aromatic compounds are discussed. Some of the fundamental concepts in organic chemistry such as “nucleophilic substitution”, “？-elimination”, “kinetic control and thermodynamic control”, “resonance”, and “aromaticity” are also expounded.\n","expected_learning":"To understand the structures, properties, and reactivity of alkenes, alkynes, alkyl halides, conjugated dienes, and aromatic compounds and the important concepts related to the chemistry of these compounds.","course_schedule":"1. Alkenes - reactions and preparation I\nPreparation of alkenes, reactions of alkenes with electrophiles which include addition of halogens and hydrogen halides, and hydration are expounded.\n2. Alkenes - reactions and preparation II\nEpoxydation, oxidative cleavage, cyclopropanation of alkenes, stereochemical course of addition of electrophiles to alkenes are expounded.\n3. Alkynes I\nNaturally occurring alkynes are explained. Preparation, electronic structure, nomenclature, and addition reaction of alkynes are expounded.\n4.
