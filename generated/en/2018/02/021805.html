The winners of Nobel prize in chemistry in 2013 are working on this field. Today people think that chemistry is not only discussed from experiments but also theoretical simulations. In this lecture, I introduce quantum mechanics, an important rule for small particles and also basics in theoretical chemistry. We will consider how the quantum mechanics is used for chemical problems. Major discussions in chemistry are based on molecular electronic states. We will solve the Schrodinger equation for the electrons in atoms or molecules by hand or using a computer, which will help you to understand the theoretical chemistry world more deeply. I expect learners already have enough knowledge for classical mechanics in high school.","expected_learning":"Learners will understand the following points.\n(1) roles of theoretical chemistry\n(2) basic knowledge of quantum mechanics\n(3) electronic structure of atoms\n(4) electronic structure of molecules\n","course_schedule":"In the beginning of each lecture, you have a small examination and you need to study beforehand every week. The problems and answers are opened in the internet. This course includes not only the lectures by the lecturer, but also includes discussions and presentations by students, experiments using a computer, and solving mathematical or physical-chemistry problems by hand. Please bring your note PC or smart phone. The lecturer will demonstrate some calculations using computational programs called Gaussian, GAMESS, Maple, and Maxima.\n1st week: Introduction: Chemistry is mathematics!\n2nd week: Review of classic mechanics in high school (equation of motion, circular motion)\n3rd week: Bohr model, partial derivative\n4th week: wave equation, nature of light and electron\n5th week: Derivation of Schrodinger equation, nature of wave function\n6th week: one-dimensional square well potential problem\n7th week: two and three-dimensional square well potential problem\n8th week: Schrodinger equation of Hydrogen atom\n9th week: Schrodinger equation of Hydrogen atom, mathematical software\n10th week: Multi-electronic atoms, electron configuration, spin\n11th week:H2+ molecule, Linear combination of atomic orbital (LCAO)\n12th week: Molecular orbital and chemical reaction\n13th week: Preparation of mini-research\n14th week: Preparation of mini-research and presentation\n15th week: Presentation\n","prerequisites":"Students entering this course are expected to have enough knowledge of physics (especially classical mechanics and wave function) at high-school level.","texts_and_materials":"Japanese text written by Nakata Munetaka “Ryoshi Kagaku Kihon no Kangaekata”","assessment":"Attitudes and mini-examinations (40%), twice reports (20% in each report), one presentation (20%).
