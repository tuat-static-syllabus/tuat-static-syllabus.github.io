The reports should show the writer understands the basic physical ideas and concepts, and having the enough skills of using them. Learners will be able to:\n・ For the various problems in real world, imagine the physics behind them and write down document as a style required.\n・ Recognize the various types of fundamental concepts and equations for a given problem, and execute the appropriate method to arrive at a solution for each type of the problem.\n・ Carry through the process of using calculation needed in understanding basics of modern physics.\n","course_schedule":"This course provides students with the fundamentals in modern physics and the fundamentals of mathematical tools that are inevitable in understanding physics. The topics covered are all physics from the Newton equation to quantum mechanics, but mainly on classical physics. Students will learn to recognize the basic types of concepts and equations, and the proper method to use and to solve simple problem.\nSpecific coverage will include:\n・ 1. Classical mechanics in general\n・ 2. Space time character\n・ 3. Newton equation\n・ 4. Transformation between frames\n・ 5. The least action principle\n・ 6. Lagrange equation\n・ 7. Symmetry\n・ 8. Invariants\n・ 9. Hamilton equation\n・ 10. Phase space and dynamical system\n・ 11. Basic simple stochastic processes\n・ 12. Basic simple electrodynamics\n・ 13. Basic simple statistical mechanics\n・ 14. Basic simple chaos system\n・ 15. Basic simple quantum mechanics\n","prerequisites":"Students entering this class are assumed to have had simple calculus and simple differential equations.","texts_and_materials":"None","assessment":"On the issues provided by the instructor during the lectures, three reports that are originally written by students themselves until the due dates are evaluated. The reports should show the writer understands the basic physical ideas and concepts, and having the skills of using them. Reports assignments will be given in the course. Due date will be specified, but is typically near the end of term. Only for those who submitted three reports, the final grade is evaluated, by about 60% of the contents of each the report and about 40% of the attendance of the course lectures. No Exams.\n\nLast Year's Grade Distribution S(10%) A(25%) B(35%) C(25%) D(5%)\n","message_from_instructor":"Through learning the physical concepts and history of physics, I expect students learn how to think matters with originality and creativity.","course_keywords":"Classical mechanics, Newton equation, transformation, least action principle, Lagrange equation, Hamilton equation, space time character, phase space, symmetry, invariants, gauge theories, stochastic processes, statistical mechanics, chaos system, quantum mechanics","office_hours":"None","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://www.chaos-math.org/ja","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/25/2018 10:50:59 AM","name":{"id":507,"ja":"物理学基礎","en":"Basic Physics"},"instructor":{"id":1129,"ja":"井原 茂男","en":"IHARA Sigeo"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Wed.4","references":"Some of them will be given in the course."}}
