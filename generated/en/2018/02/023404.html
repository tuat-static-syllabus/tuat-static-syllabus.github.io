Next, learn how to design reactors of various types using the speed equation. Reaction engineering is one of the major subjects in chemical engineering and is essential knowledge in chemistry work. We will train both the ability to create engineering design expressions using mathematics and reaction skills such as method of measuring reaction phenomena, mathematical expression model of data, designing method of reactor by design equations, and the ability to master it.","expected_learning":"① It is possible to plan the reaction experiment and analyze the obtained data to determine the reaction rate formula.\n② Using the reaction rate formula, calculate the design of various reactors (batch type reactor, flow type stirring tank type reactor, tube type reactor) and calculate the size and operating condition (concentration, temperature, flow rate Etc.) can be set.\n③ The reaction rate formula can be determined when multiple reactions occur simultaneously.\n④ It becomes possible to select a reaction device when multiple reactions occur simultaneously.\n⑤ The catalyst effective coefficient can be obtained in the solid catalytic reaction.\n","course_schedule":"The lecture explains the contents of the textbook, explains how to solve the problem with the example, and makes the exercise problem at the end of the chapter be submitted as a homework each time.\n(1) Chemical reaction and reaction equipment (once or twice)\nReaction engineering is engineering concerning selection of reasonable and economical reaction process and establishment of operating conditions, selection and design and operation of an appropriate reactor type, learning to be an important field of chemical engineering .\n(2) Determination of reaction rate formula (3 to 6 times)\nLearn (i) steady state approximation method and (ii) rate limiting step approximation method as a derivation method of reaction rate equation.\nPoint 1 of taking classes so far: Learn methods of reaction experiments conducted in the laboratory and data analysis methods.\n(3) Basic formula of reactor design (7 to 12 times)\nAbout three reactors of batch reactor, (2) continuous tank type reactor, and (3) tube type reactor\nLearn the basic formula of design.\nMidterm exam (do 13 times) at the lecture time around the end of May.
