We focus on current science and technology issues in Japan. These lectures will not only provide students with an important foundation in science and technology, but also help them develop ideas of their own research. In this semester the development and status of Japanese science and technology is explained through a keyword “Material” which acted as several breakthrough in the innovations in the field of science and technology.","expected_learning":"Quoted above.","course_schedule":"1.
