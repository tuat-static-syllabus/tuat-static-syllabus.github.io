Complex analysis is widely used in applied mathematics, physics and engineering and so on.\nA complex function is the function in which the independent variable and dependent variable are both complex numbers. We will define differentiations and integrations of complex functions in a similar way of functions of real numbers. We will see a marvelous theory after learning particular properties of complex functions such as Euler's formula, Cauchy's integral theorem and the theorem of residue.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course is\n(1) to understand and master basic methods of calculations of differentiations and integrations of complex functions, and\n(2) to understand particular properties on differentiable functions, and to be capable of performing practical computations by using Cauchy's integral theorem and the theorem of residue.","course_schedule":"1.
