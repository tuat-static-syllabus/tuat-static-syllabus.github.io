Attitude expression and rotational motion, classification of stabilization method, control method based on classical control and modern control theories will be lectured. The stability condition, spin speed control and spin axis control of passive spin-stabilized satellites will be explained, focusing on the relationship with attitude representation. Classification of triaxial satellites, their rotational motion characteristics, and attitude control are lectured for each classification.","expected_learning":"It is required to understand the attitude representation, control methods, attitude control devices, disturbance torque acting on the artificial satellite, the operation principle of attitude sensosr. It is required to learn and understand equations of rotational motion of the artificial satellite and the control methodology for designing the artificial satellite attitude control.\nPass criterion for this lecture is to exceed 60 points with respect to the total points of the report evaluation score and the final exam score.","course_schedule":"1. Purpose and method of guidance control\n2. Types and characteristics of attitude stabilization method of artificial satellite\n3. Rotational Geometry (attitude representation by Euler angles and angular velocity)\n4. Representation of spinning satellite motion by rigid body equation of rotational motion\n5. Stability condition of single spin-stabilized satellite\n6. Rotational speed control of single spin-stabilized satellites (jet dumping, yo-yo de-spinner)\n7.
