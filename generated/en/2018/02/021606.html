But you just learned the result of the physical phenomenon and memorized the physical laws only. Therefore, you did not have the chance to know how the law of physics was derived. In \"Introduction to Mechanics\", after mathematical preparation, we will pick up two items \"Motion of objects\" and \"Energy\". Regarding these basic items, we will give lectures incorporating experiments. The purpose of this lecture is to gain a physical view and idea.","expected_learning":"Understand how to describe the motion of object and its mathematical meaning.\nUnderstand the relationship between \"force and work\" \"work and energy\" \"energy and force\".","course_schedule":"0.
