Atoms and molecules are not the rigorously smallest particles by the smallest units showing the properties of materials. Due to these reasons we study quantum mechanically the basis of atoms and molecules in order to obtain appropriate image of nano-scale world.","expected_learning":"1) To become able to understand atomic internal states and able to explain their properties.\n2) To become able to explain, at least qualitatively, the internal structures of multi-electron atoms.\n3) To become able to explain the origin of chemical bonds and their characteristice difference.\n4) To became able to understand conceptually the interaction between atoms and molecules and the chemical reactions.","course_schedule":"(1) Introduction.\n(2) Revision of one electron atoms.\n(3) Two electron atoms; electron spin and operators.\n(4) Eigen energies and wave functions of two electron atoms; basic concept and independent particle model.\n(5) Eigen energies and wave functions of two electron atoms; approximations.\n(6) Electronic structures of multi-electron atoms.\n(7) Internal structures of diatomic molecules; electronic coupled equation and Born-Oppenheimer approximation.\n(8) Potential energy curves of diatomic molecules and the internal motion on them.\n(9) Electronic states, symmetry properties, and avoided crossing of diatomic molecules.\n(10) Chemical bond; hydrogen ion.\n(11) Chemical bond; hydrogen molecules.\n(12) Electronic structures of more complex diatomic molecules.\n(13) Inter-atomic/molecular interaction and chemical reactions; cross sections and reaction rate.\n(14) Inter-atomic/molecular interaction and chemical reactions; motion of potential curves(surfaces) and deflection function.\n(15) Inter-atomic/molecular interaction and chemical reactions, classical theory of scattering and its cross section.","prerequisites":"Quantum mechanics I and II are assumed to be completed. Internatl structures od atoms and molecules are treated quantum mechnically. The interaction of atoms and molecules and the chemical reactions are treated classically. The students in the group of quatum systems and meterial physics are highly recommended to join.","texts_and_materials":"Not specified.
