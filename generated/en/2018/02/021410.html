This helps us to be able to know behaviors of various organisms (from microorganisms to human beings). This subject allows answering basic questions such as \"What is an organism?\" and \"What is definition of being alive?\". This course treats basic contents of biology and mechanisms of biological phenomena. Likewise, the course introduces state-of-the-art biotechnologies and their relevance to human beings and society.\n\nThe course consists of 13 lectures and two exams. Potential changes in the schedule will be notified during the course. Each lecture ends up with a small quiz to check understanding of contents.\n\n","expected_learning":"This subject allows answering basic questions such as \"What is an organism?\" and \"What is definition of being alive?\".","course_schedule":"#1 Guidance and origins of living organisms\n#2 Classification of organisms\n#3 Cell\n#4 Cell constituents: water, amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and sugers\n#5 Heredity and genes\n#6 DNA replication and repair\n#7 The central dogma\n#8 Interim exam\n#9 Reproduction, development and differentiation\n#10 Enzyme and the way to acquire energy\n#11 Animal organs\n#12 Microorganisms and virus\n#13 Photosynthesis\n#14 State-of-the-art biotechnologies\n#15 Final exam","prerequisites":"None","texts_and_materials":"None","assessment":"45% interim exam\n45% final exam\n10% a small quiz\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"biology, cell, energy, organism,","office_hours":"Should contact via a mail.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"7/11/2018 4:04:54 PM","name":{"id":509,"ja":"生物学基礎","en":"Basic Biology"},"instructor":{"id":510,"ja":"寺田 昭彦","en":"TERADA Akihiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Tue.1","references":"Biology of the Cell 5th Version\nCain Biology"}}
