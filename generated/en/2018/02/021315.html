The natures depend on those of the constituent atoms while the changes stem from the arrangement and rearrangement of atoms. The combination of atoms affords various chemical bonds with the specific structures and properties of the substance. This course discusses such fundamentals of chemistry, taking various examples of inorganic simple substances and compounds.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to understand the meaning of “orbital” and the necessity of the periodic law (Part 1), two ways of approaching covalent bonds (localized bonds approximation and delocalized molecular orbitals approximation) (Part 2), and several items proper to inorganic chemistry such as ionic solids, coordination compounds, and acids and bases (Part 3).","course_schedule":"Part 0 (Chapter 1, Section 2 in the text)\n\nWeek 1\nCharacteristics of inorganic chemistry when compared with other fields of chemistry; Minimum knowledge on thermochemistry necessary for this course.\n\nPart 1 (Chapter 2)\n\nWeek 2\nAtomic orbitals (AOs) (1).

With this understanding, learners are expected to understand the fundamental concepts and principles indispensable not only for this course but for other courses in which the natures of individual chemical species are discussed.\nDepending on learners’ comprehension, explanation for certain items may be repeated; in that case the above mentioned schedule will be changed and some items will have to be omitted.\n","course_keywords":"Atoms and molecules, Periodic law, Covalent bond, Ionic solids, Acids and bases","office_hours":"Monday 12:00 - 13:00 (School day)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/22/2018 1:37:10 PM","name":{"id":522,"ja":"無機化学Ⅰ","en":"Inorganic Chemistry Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":498,"ja":"尾﨑 弘行","en":"OZAKI Hiroyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"後学期","course_type":"後学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"","day_period":"月2","references":"Handouts will be distributed.
