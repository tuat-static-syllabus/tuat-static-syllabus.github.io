In the course, we will learn about differentiation and integration of multivariable functions, such as partial differentiations, criteria of local maxima and minima, double integrations, volumes of solids, line integrations and series. Various computations will be practiced with drawing diagrams.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiation and integration of two variable functions, and\n(2) to be capable of performing practical computations.","course_schedule":"1. Limits and continuity of functions of two variables\n2. Partial differentiations\n3. Total differentiations and partial differentiations of composite functions\n4. Differentiations in higher order, and Taylor’s theorem(1)\n5. Taylor's theorem(2)\n6. Local maxima and minima of functions of two variables\n7. Double integrations(1)\n8. Double integrations(2)\n9. Improper integrations\n10. Triple integrations, and changes of variables by using the system of polar coordinates\n11. Volumes of solids and areas of surfaces\n12. Line integrations and Green's theorem\n13. Series and power series 1\n14. Series and power series 2\n15.
