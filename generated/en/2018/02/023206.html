In this course, students will learn theoretical background, then will execute molecular orbital calculations using a molecular orbital analysis software GAMESS. The purpose is to learn a method for interpretation of computational results.","expected_learning":"(1) Students should understand the Schroedinger equation, approximation theory (variational method, Huckel method, Hartree-Fock method, etc.), and some applications (Walsh diagram, Woodward-Hoffmann rules, etc.) .\n(2) Students will be able to perform molecular orbital calculations of small molecules.\n","course_schedule":"1) Schroedinger equation\n2) Atomic orbitals of hydrogen-like atoms (1)\n3) Atomic orbitals of hydrogen-like atoms (2)\n4) One-center two-electron systems and variational method\n5) Multi-electron atom, Pauli exclusion principle and Hund's rule\n6) Molecular orbital and Slater determinant\n7) Homonulcear diatomic molecules\n8) Orbital-orbital interaction, Huckel method, Bonding and antibonding orbital\n9) Heteronuclear diatomic molecules\n10) Polyatomic molecules, Walsh diagram, Diels-Alder reaction\n11) Instollation of GAMESS, Z-matrix, basis sets, spin multiplicity\n12) Molecular orbital calculation of Homonulcear diatomic molecules\n13) Molecular orbital calculation of Heteronuclear diatomic molecules\n14) Molecular orbital calculation of Polyatomic molecules\n15) Final examination:All topics in this course may be covered\n","prerequisites":"PC skills are required.","texts_and_materials":"藤永 茂 著「入門分子軌道法」講談社 ISBN4-06-153325-8","assessment":"Basically, evaluation is made with the results of examination.
