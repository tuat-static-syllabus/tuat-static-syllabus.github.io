At the beginning of the lecture, we will introduce the index, which shows space propulsion capability, by deriving the rocket equation. Next, in the first half lectures, we will focus on electric propulsion. Here, a thruster of an artificial satellite by this method is being developed and applied practically. Principles and theories of various thrusters in addition to basic plasma will be described.\nIn the second half of lectures, we will focus on chemical rocket propulsion. First, chemical rocket propulsion system will be overviewed. Next, basics of compressible fluid will be described for developing the Nozzle theory.\n\nGoal:\nUnderstandings of a propulsion principle and a capability index in space, and also of various features of thrusters and related theories.\n","expected_learning":"In the field of space propulsion, which has been advancing recently, we will give lectures on chemical and electric propulsions.
