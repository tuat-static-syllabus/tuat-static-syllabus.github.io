Then we learn about the phenomena of wave motion. With the one-dimensional wave, important phenomena such as reflection, standing wave, and natural vibration are explained. We further proceed to two and three-dimensional waves, where Huygens' principle, refraction, and diffraction are important topics to understand. Frequent mentions are to be made about the application to the physical phenomena in our daily life and the connections to material science.","expected_learning":"1.
