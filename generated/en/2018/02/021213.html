It aims to understand and predict the dynamics of both daily mechanical phenomena and also celestial phenomena.A deep understanding of macroscopic dyanamics will provide the first step for studying the quantum dynamics governing microscopic dynamics.","expected_learning":"The students are required to write down the equations of motion for dynamical problems concerning a particle, and also they are required to provide general and specific solutions satisfying initial conditions. They should understand the dynamics of vibrational and rotational motions.","course_schedule":"1. What is classical mechanics?\n2. Newton's laws of motion 　\n3. Forces and their origin\n4. Gravitation, normal force, friction, drag and restoring force\n5. One-dimensional motion under uniform gravitational force\n6. Ordinary differential equations and their solutions\n7. Harmonic oscillation and damped harmonic motions\n8. Forced oscillation and resonance\n9. Exercise in one-dimensional motions\n10. Kinetic energy and potential energy\n11.
