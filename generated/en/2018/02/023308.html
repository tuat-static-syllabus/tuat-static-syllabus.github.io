At part of “experiment of organic reaction and synthesis (organic chemistry Ⅱ)”, Akiko OKAMOTO and Michiko MATSUMOTO will teach basic technique such as liquid separation, distillation, and recrystallization. Through this experiments, you will learn reaction behavior of organic molecules and how to handle labile chemical species.\n[Experiment about superstructure of polymer]\nKnowledge about polymer structure is important for understanding of physical/chemical character of polymer. In these experiments, you will perform experiments about microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and light scattering which are major methods to estimate polymer structure. Before experiments, you will present about homework by oral trial.\n[Experiment of organic reaction and synthesis (organic chemistry Ⅱ)]\nThe bonding formation reaction based on chemical characters of carbonyl group is widely used for synthesis of organic molecules and polymer materials. In these experiments, you will perform synthesis reactions by using high electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon and high nucleophilicity of enolate.\n","expected_learning":"To understand the organic reaction of carbonyl compounds by comparing with reactivity, structural features, and stability of the carbonyl compounds.","course_schedule":"[Experiment about superstructure of polymer]\n1.
