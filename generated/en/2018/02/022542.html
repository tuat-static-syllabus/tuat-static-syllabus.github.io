In the part of fluid dynamics, we take up the properties of the fluid, the dynamics of the stationary fluid, the conservation law of mass, the energy balance formula, and Bernoulli's equation. In the part of thermodynamics, we cover the basic concept, the thermodynamics zero law, the heat and specific heat, the heat and work, the first law of thermodynamics, the calm process, the ideal gas, the thermal efficiency and the Carnot cycle.\n","expected_learning":"I will aim to understand the theory which I picked up in class by solving concrete problems concerning the contents of the lesson in Thermal Engineering I (late one year) and Fluid Dynamics I (2 years earlier).","course_schedule":"Take 12 themes in all and exercise in the cycle of explanation of each item, homework presentation (late Monday), homework submission (Wednesday), review test (first Monday of the following week) for each unit. The schedule of one lecture time is as follows.\n\n(1) previous review test, homework return, commentary (20 minutes)\n(2) Review test (30 minutes)\n(3) Explanation of contents of today (20 minutes)\n(4) Problem exercises, assignment presentation (20 minutes)\n\nBoth the homework report and the review test are to be presented in English.\n\n1st week Orientation; Fluid (1) Fluid Properties, Effective Numbers\n2nd week Review of the 2nd fluid (1) test; fluid (2) dynamics of the stationary fluid\n3rd week Fluid (2) review test; fluid (3) mass conservation law\n4th week Fluid (3) Review Test; Fluid (4) Energy Balance Formula\n5th week Fluid (4) Review Test; Fluid (5) Bernoulli Formula\n6th week Fluid (5) review test; fluid (6) momentum equation\n7th week The review test of fluid (6) review; heat (1) basic concept\n8th week test Heat (1) review test; heat (2) Thermodynamics No. 0 law, heat quantity and specific heat\n9th week Heat (2) review test; heat (3) heat and work\n10th week The review test of heat (3); the heat (4) The thermodynamics of the closed system The 1st law, the calm process\n11th week Review test of heat (4); heat (5) thermodynamics first principle in ideal gas\n12th week Review test of heat (5); heat (6) Thermal efficiency and Carnot cycle\n13rd week Review test of heat (6)\n14th week preliminary date\n15th week preliminary date\n","prerequisites":"Nothing special.

The breakdown is as follows:\nHomework report (3 points, 1 point of submission, 1 point of content, 1 point of receiving)\nReview test (5 points)\n.A score of 8 points / unit × 12 unit = 96 points + 4 registration points points (100 points full score) with score of 60 or more is regarded as acceptable.\n","message_from_instructor":"○ Do not leave the room\n○ Turn off the mobile phone\n○ In the homework report,\n・ To use paper distributed in class. In case of losing, tell the teacher (TA).\n・ Those submitted after the deadline will be submitted at zero\n・ The thing judged by the grader that it copied grapes is zero even if it is correct\n・ If you did not receive it at the timing of the return at the beginning of the lesson,\n○ In the review test,\n・ English-Japanese dictionary (electronic dictionary acceptable), textbooks, distribution materials can be seen\n・ Cheating (oral consultation with the surroundings, e-mail, exchange of information by phone) is prohibited\nIn particular, information exchanges between 3 and 4 are strictly prohibited, when they are discovered, they will not give units permanently\n○ Designate a seat\n○ Make sure to file distributed materials such as graded homework reports, test answers, grading standards, and bring them at every lecture time\n","course_keywords":"Fluid dynamics, Thermodynamics","office_hours":"lunch break next day after the test return date","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"6/27/2018 12:02:04 PM","name":{"id":1815,"ja":"熱流体演習","en":"Exercises in Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics"},"instructor":{"id":1139,"ja":"亀田 正治, 岩本 薫","en":"KAMEDA Masaharu, IWAMOTO Kaoru"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"後学期","course_type":"後学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"","day_period":"月4","references":""}}
