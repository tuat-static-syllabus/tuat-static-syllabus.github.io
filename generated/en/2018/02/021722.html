These characteristics are Voltage, Current, Impedance, Frequency and Equiliberium conditions of the circuit.\n1. Transformation (including Ideal Transformer)\n2. Loop Equation (Loop Current method), Node Equation (Node Voltage method)\n3. Basic theorem in circuit analysis such as, Inverse Theorem, Equiliberium Power Sources, Maximum Power Transmission Theorem\n4. 2-Ports parameters, Cascading connction, Parallel connection, different operation of 2-Ports circuits","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"The followings are the contents of the course (these contents might be changed based on the flow of the classes).\n\n1st Class: guidance of the entire course (you need to study chapter 1 through 6 yourself)\n\n\nChapter 7: Transformer\n　In this chapter we will study about the basic equation, the characteristics and the features of the transformer. Transformers with single, two or more coils, such as a tight coupling transformer and an ideal transformer, are used for a circuit. We also study about understanding the meaning of mutual-inductance, M, as well.\n\n2nd Class: 2-winding transformer, control source\n3rd Class: Auto-transformer, ideal transformer\n4th Class: Multi-transformer\n\nChapter 8: Circuit Equation\nIn this chapter we study about the foundations of how to form equations for calculating voltage and current in a circuit. For this sake we use the application of Kirchhoff's law, a loop circuit current method, and a node voltage method.\nAs circuits have R, C, L, and M, then we should understand well that voltage and current are governed by them.\n\n5th Class: Loop Equation\n6th Class: Nodal Equation\n7th Class: Solution of simultaneous linear equations\n\n* First mid-term test will be held after finishing the Chapter 8.\n\nChapter 9: Theorem and Characteristics for Deeply Understanding of Circuits\nIn this chapter, for deeply understanding the circuits, we study about many theorem such as a Reverse Theorem, Thevenin's Theorem, Norton's Theorem, Compensation Theorem, and the Law of Maximum Power Transmission, etc.\n\n8th Class: Reverse Theorem, Duality, Reverse Circuit\n9th Class: Equivalent Power Supply and Compensation Theorem\n10th Class: Maximum Power Transmission Theorem\n\nChapter 10: 2-Ports Network Parameters\nIn this chapter we learn about how to express the relation of voltage and current of 2-ports networks by 6 different matrices such as Z, Y, g, h, F, Fi. These 2-Port Networks are widely used in circuit analysis.\nAlso, we study about Input/Output impedance, transmission quantity, repetitive parameter, etc. Moreover, we study about the fundamental characteristic which is needed when using this kind of network.\n\n11th Class: Six different parameters of 2-Ports network.\n\n* 2nd mid-term test will be held after finishing the 11th Class.\n\n12th Class: Mutual conversion of parameters in 2-Ports network.\n13th Class: Cascade connection and parallel connection of 2-Ports networks.\n14th Class: Operations of 2-Ports network\n15th Class: Final examination","prerequisites":"Condition for taking this course\nUnderstanding of Circuit Theory 1 is required for understanding this course.
