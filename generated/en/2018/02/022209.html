Students will especially learn the concept of equilibrium through this course. Much emphasis will be put on the improvements of students’ English skills as well. For example, vocabulary tests will be conducted at the beginning of each lecture. Additionally, several workshops are scheduled to deepen understandings of the concept of each chapter through the exercises in the textbook.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"Week 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Lecture (chapter 4), Physical Transformation of Pure Substances I\nWeek 3: Lecture (chapter 4), Physical Transformation of Pure Substances II\nWeek 4: Exercises (chapter 4)\nWeek 5: Examines (chapter 4)\nWeek 6: Lecture (chapter 5), Simple Mixture I\nWeek 7: Lecture (chapter 5), Simple Mixture II\nWeek 8: Lecture (chapter 5), Simple Mixture III\nWeek 9: Examines (chapter 5-1)\nWeek 10: Examines (chapter 5-2)\nWeek 11: Examines (chapter 5)\nWeek 12: Lecture (chapter 6), Chemical Equilibrium I\nWeek 13: Lecture (chapter 6), Chemical Equilibrium II\nWeek 14: Exercises (chapter 6)\nWeek 15: Examines (chapter 6)","prerequisites":"Students are strongly recommended to take Physical Chemistry I in advance.","texts_and_materials":"Atkins' Physical Chemistry\nOxford University Press","assessment":"Total evaluation of mini examinations (including vocabulary tests), exercises (workshop), attendance, and full examinations.","message_from_instructor":"Attendance at every lecture, preparations, and reviews are recommended.","course_keywords":"Thermodynamics, chemical equilibrium,","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/22/2018 11:58:35 AM","name":{"id":606,"ja":"物理化学Ⅱ","en":"Physical Chemistry Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":591,"ja":"直井 勝彦","en":"NAOI Katsuhiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Thu.3","references":""}}
