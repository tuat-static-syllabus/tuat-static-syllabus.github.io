With the comparison to the prokaryotes on the following basic aspects, the students will learn 1) the structure of genome and gene, 2) DNA replication, transcription, and translation, and 3) the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. This course will further help the students to understand the molecular biology of the cells containing cancer-related genes.","expected_learning":"By the end of the course, the students should have to understand the biological phenomenon of eukaryotes on the molecular level.","course_schedule":"Unit 1 Introduction\nUnit 2 Structure of chromosome\nIn contrast to prokaryotic organism, the DNA of eukaryotic organism is enclosed by the nuclear membrane. The DNAs are packaged and ordered by the highly alkaline proteins, histone, to form the chromosome. In this lesson/unit, the mechanism for the chromosome formation will be generally discussed.\nUnit 3 Transcription\nIn this lesson/unit, the mechanism of RNA transcription from DNA including the transcription factor will be discussed.\nUnit 4-6 Regulation of gene expression I-III\nThe eukaryotic transcription apparatus and transcription factors which are essential for the regulation of gene expression are distinct from those in prokaryotes. In this lesson/unit, the mechanism of gene expression regulation in eukaryotes will be generally discussed via the comparison to prokaryotes.\nUnit 7 Topics\nUnit 8 Mid-term examination\nUnit 9 Replication and repair\nIn this lesson/unit, the mechanism of DNA replication and repair including the mismatch repair (?), excision repair, and recombinational repair.\nUnit 10,11 Translation I,II\nIn this lesson/unit, the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, mechanism of eukaryotic translation and its differences from the prokaryotes will be discussed.\nUnit 12 Development of cancer\nUnit 13 Molecular mechanism of signal transduction\nUnit 14 Summary\nUnit 15 Final examination\n\n","prerequisites":"The students should have already completed the basic molecular biology and molecular biology 1.

Furthermore, I hope the students can always explain what they have learned in this course generally in their own words.","course_keywords":"Eukaryotes, DNA replication, transcription and translation, chromosome, regulation of gene expression, transcription factor","office_hours":"13:00 － 14:00, Monday","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/2/2018 11:49:39 AM","name":{"id":168,"ja":"分子生物学Ⅱ","en":"Molecular Biology Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":578,"ja":"吉野 知子","en":"YOSHINO Tomoko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Fri.2","references":"Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Molecular Biology of the Cell 5E, Garland Science."}}
