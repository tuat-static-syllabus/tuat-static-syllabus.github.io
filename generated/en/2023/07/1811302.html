The seminars are centered on discussion and laboratory work under the supervision of three research supervisors. Students will finalize their research plan as well as improve their competency through seminars and laboratory work at the research laboratory of the principal supervisor. In the seminars, students will prepare a presentation at an international conference and publication of their drafts to an international scholarly journal. In the process, students are expected to recognize the relationship and relevance of their research theme with related fields of study. Students are also expected to acquire a diverse academic perspective, which is essential in sustainability research, and understand the usefulness of learning and conceptualization methods used in other disciplines. In order to instill an interdisciplinary perspective centered on their doctoral dissertation theme, students will hold discussions from various perspectives with students taking Interdisciplinary Seminar I to IV, and learn knowledge and approaches to analysis and social implementation in other fields.","expected_learning":"Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to:\n- enhance core competency in their doctoral dissertation research field.\n- explain the purpose and significance of their research in relation to current research trends.\n- refine their doctoral research by accelerating each aspect of research, namely, comprehension, analysis and implementation, through discussions with the assistant supervisors.\n- acquire consensus-building skills and the capacity to adapt to diverse value systems and environments.\n- leverage new ideas, knowledge, and information obtained through meaningful academic exchanges with researchers not only in their specialized fields but also from other disciplines, into the design of their doctoral dissertation research.\n","course_schedule":"The principal supervisor will coordinate with the co-supervisors to hold regular seminars in each of their laboratories. Remote lecture systems or other media may be used as necessary.\nStudents will hold group reading and discussion of important previous research in their specialized fields and other related fields to enhance their competency. In particular, students are expected to acquire the capability to adapt to the various problems that arise during the conduct of their research/experiment as well as to the countermeasures to those problems, and to recognize the significance and originality of their research in relation to previous studies, while incorporating the results of discussions in the seminars into their daily laboratory work and research activities. At the same time, discussions with the principal supervisor and the two co-supervisors will be held to train students to clearly explain the academic contributions of their research, as well as to improve their doctoral dissertation research plans in consideration of opinions of faculty members in other disciplines. Students are expected to actively engage in discussions with the co-supervisors and research laboratory members and in communicating their own experience, analytical approach, and ideas.\nAt the end of the course, students will prepare to present their research concept and implementation plan for the collaborative humanities and sciences colloquium as part of the “Advanced Practicum in Sustainability Research IV” Course.\n","prerequisites":"You are recommended to prepare for, and review, the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University for each class.","texts_and_materials":"To be decided upon discussion with students at the start of the class.","assessment":"Participation and contribution 100%","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/27/2023 11:48:52 AM","name":{"id":701,"ja":"科学技術表現法","en":"English for Science and Technology"},"instructor":{"id":667,"ja":"中條 拓伯","en":"NAKAJO Hironori"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Doctor)","category":"common courses","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"To be distributed and introduced in each class."}}
