IoT devices include semiconductor elements that are responsible for photoelectric conversion. Learning the roles and driving principles of these semiconductor electronic devices is indispensable for designing higher-performance IoT devices in the future.\n\n\nIn Electronic Device II, students learn semiconductor energy devices, solar cells, photodetectors, and light emitting elements with details, in addition to fundamentals of semiconductor properties learnt in Electronic Device I. Knowledge and thinking ability obtained in this class will pave the way to develop novel practical IoT devices in future.\nThe lecturer of this course has the firsthand experiences on technology management in a national research institute and will describe actual examples from industry for case-studies, analyses and discussion.","expected_learning":"The general goal of this course is\nTo understand fundamental of semiconductors, including carrier mobilities, band structures.\nTo understand driving mechanisms of electronic devices such as pn diodes, FETs, solar cells, LEDs, Photodetectors, other electronic devices required for SDGs society.\n","course_schedule":"Google classroom code：ej32pp4\n1.
