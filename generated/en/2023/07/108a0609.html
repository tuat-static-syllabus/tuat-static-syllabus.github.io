In this class, we discuss processor technologies especially on cache memory in a computing system.\nCache technology for multi-processing is discussed, too.\n","expected_learning":"Can explain parallel processing system architecture.\nCan judge performance of the parallel computing system quantitatively.\nCan apply basic knowledge on parallel processing to the students' own researches.\n","course_schedule":"This course uses the famous text book \"Computer Architecture Quantitative Approach\" and make presentation of the assigned subsection in the Chapter5, thread level parallelism.\nThe Content of the course is as follows:\n\n#1. Basic concept of parallel processing and its purpose\n#2. Basic Data communication in parallel processing: shared memory and message passing\n#3. Presentation of communication protocol using shared memory1\n#4. Presentation of communication protocol using shared memory2\n#5. Basic concept of cache memory in a single processor\n#6. Cache organization for shared memory: Basic protocol\n#7. Presentation of cache coherence protocol: Basic protocol\n#8. Cache organization for shared memory: Other outstanding protocols\n#9. Presentation of cache coherence protocol: Other outstanding protocols No.1\n#10. Presentation of cache coherence protocol: Other outstanding protocols No.2\n#11. Presentation of cache coherence protocol: Other outstanding protocols No3\n#12. Presentation of the surveyed advanced technology for acceleration No.1\n#13.
