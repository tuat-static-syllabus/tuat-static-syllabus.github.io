The grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, and online tests. Standard study time set by the our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows: Normal score and assignment test: 50%, and final test: 50%. Grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"12:00-13:00 in weekdays.
