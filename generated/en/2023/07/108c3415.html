In the future, there will be many opportunities to present the results and progress of research at companies, etc., and this is highly important. The purpose of this course is to practice and master a series of tasks up to the presentation, such as preparation of a presentation draft, preparation of presentation materials, practice of presentation, and presentation at an academic conference.\nWith the consent of the academic advisor, students will present their research at academic societies. The student will be evaluated on her/his ability to give a professional presentation at an academic conference and answer questions after preparing a presentation draft and presentation materials and practicing the presentation","expected_learning":"To be able to present one's own research results at actual national (international) conferences. To be able to respond appropriately to questions from experts.\n\nPerspectives on the diploma policy of this course: Please refer to the curriculum map in the course guide.\n","course_schedule":"In order to receive credit for this course, students must present their research at an academic conference with the consent of their academic advisor and are required to submit an abstract.\n\nSufficient preparation is required for the presentation at the conference. In the preparation stage of the presentation, students are required to have repeated discussions with their supervisors and other laboratory members, and to improve their presentation drafts, presentation materials, and presentation content by receiving advice and criticism. The student should be able to give a presentation that can withstand the evaluation of experts in the actual conference presentation. It is also important to be well prepared to answer questions from experts in a straightforward manner during questioning. This series of processes will contribute to the development of researchers and engineers with a high level of expertise and awareness.","prerequisites":"Although this course is classified as a common course and is not treated as a required course, it is strongly recommended to take this course because it is important for graduate students to practice presenting research at conferences.\nThe course content should be at least equivalent to the standard number of hours at the University, and students should follow the instructions of their academic advisors.\n","texts_and_materials":"None.","assessment":"Comprehensive evaluation will be made based on the preparation of the abstract, the process of preparation for the presentation, the content of the conference presentation, and responses to questions.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Conference presentation","office_hours":"It depends on your advisor, so please check with your advisor.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/13/2023 2:26:13 PM","name":{"id":658,"ja":"熱工学Ⅱ","en":"Thermal Engineering Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":581,"ja":"陸名 雄一","en":"RIKUNA Yuichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":null,"course_type":null,"facility_affiliation":"Veterinary Clinic","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"None."}}
