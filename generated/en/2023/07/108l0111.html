While reviewing high school-level chemistry, classes will introduce the key principles in chemistry, which involves atomic orbitals, valence bond theory, molecular orbital theory, molecular representations, acids and bases, stereochemistry. A particular emphasis is placed on learning the structures of organic compounds, so that it will serve as an introductory course for Bioorganic Chemistry courses.","expected_learning":"Learn the basics of bioorganic chemistry for proteins, nucleic acids, and coenzymes. Students will also gain the ability to understand cutting-edge research on bioorganic chemistry and communicate it to researchers in other specialized fields in an easy-to-understand manner.","course_schedule":"Based on the latest scientific literature, we conduct a literature search on research themes that are different from those of the master's course. In addition, summarize the contents of the survey in a report and give an oral presentation.\nDiscuss from a scientific point of view based on the presentation.","prerequisites":"Organic chemistry undergraduate level","texts_and_materials":"Bioorganic Chemistry, by Dugas (Springer)","assessment":"Presentation and disucussion 80%\nQuiz in every term 20%","message_from_instructor":"Discover new discoveries in life sciences by learning biochemistry from organic chemistry","course_keywords":"protein, nucleic acid, enzyme, drug discovery, organic synthesis","office_hours":"Monday, 12-14 pm","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/5/2023 5:05:36 PM","name":{"id":665,"ja":"幾何学","en":"Geometry"},"instructor":{"id":648,"ja":"室尾 和之, 生嶋 健司, 香取 浩子","en":"MUROO Kazuyuki, IKUSHIMA Kenji, KATORI Hiroko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Veterinary Clinic","office":"","day_period":"Wed.2","references":"Medicinal Chemistry (by Kita, Hiraoka, Tokyo Kagaku-Dojin)"}}
