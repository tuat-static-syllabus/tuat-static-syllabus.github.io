Since the structures, reactions, and functionalities of the molecules are governed by the behaviors of the electrons, it is of fundamental importance to design organic materials with your eyes set on the electronic structures. Following the relevant undergraduate courses, this course discusses methodologies for examining the electronic structures and properties of organic molecules.\nClasscode：ufh3stw","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to\n(1) revive their skills in microscopic organic chemistry, likely to be deteriorated during graduation research;\n(2) examine the electronic structures, stability, and reactivity of molecules with paper and a pencil;\n(3) gain a foothold for further self-study to carry out quantum chemical calculations or read through the literature of this fields.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1\nGuidance/Introduction\nType of bonds/Occurrence and Definition of Hydrogen bond/Properties of Hydrogen bonded substances/importance of the Hydrogen bond\n\nWeek 2\nMethods of Detection: Nonspectroscopic Technique\n\nWeek 3\nMethods of Detection: Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy\n\nWeek 4\nMethods of Detection: Other Spectroscopic Techniques\n\nWeek 5\nIntramolecular hydrogen bonds\n\nWeek 6\nWhat Groups From hydrogen Bonds?\n\nWeek 7\nIntermediate examination\n\nWeek 8\nThermodynamic Properties of Hydrogen Bonds\n\nWeek 9\ntheory of the hydrogen Bond\n\nWeek 10\nHydrogen Bonds in Crystals (1)\n\nWeek 11\nHydrogen Bonds in Crystals (2)\n\nWeek 12\nHydrogen Bonds in Proteins and Nucleic Acids\n\nWeek 13\nPractical Systems Involving hydrogen Bonds\n\nWeek 14\nFinal examination.\n","prerequisites":"Ability to earn the credits of quantum chemistry I･II and structural chemistry offered for the undergraduate students of organic and polymer materials chemistry (or similar courses) is necessary.\n\nIn addition to the time in the class, students are recommended to spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University on self-learning.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Final examination (50 %) and participation in discussion (50 %).","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Every time","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/17/2023 12:44:03 PM","name":{"id":660,"ja":"材料力学Ⅱ","en":"Mechanics of Materials Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":655,"ja":"清水 大雅","en":"SHIMIZU Hiromasa"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Tue.2","references":"Handouts will be distributed."}}
