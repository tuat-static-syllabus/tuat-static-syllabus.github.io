While sometimes a nuisance for traditional electronics, these effects are now being exploited by a new generation of nanoscale devices that promise enhanced performance and even radically new capabilities. This course gives an overview of the fundamental physics of these devices, often referred to as quantum physics, with an emphasis on illustrating the physical consequences of quantum mechanics through the novel characteristics and performance of nanoscale devices.\n\nGoogle Classroom Code: exveark","expected_learning":"This course will help students with a basic background in nanotechnology and nanoelectronics to:\n1) deepen their understanding of how quantum effects can influence and define device performance,\n2) gain an overview of existing nanoscale devices as a foundation for future research,\n3) broaden their understanding of quantum physics,\n4) explain the basic principle of quantum computing.","course_schedule":"Topic 1:\nArtificial Intelligence (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Network, AI Framework, Field Programmable Gate Array, Graphics Processing Unit)\n\nTopic 2:\nNanoscale Devices (Atomic Switches, Atomic Junctions, Sigle-Electron Transistors, Quantum Bits, Superconducting Quantum Interference Device)\n\nTopic 3:\nNew Types of Computing Architectures(Ising Spin Computing, Neuro Computing, Brain-Inspired Computing, Neuromorphic Devices, Combinatorial Optimization Problems)\n\nTopic 4:\nQuantum Computing (Quantum Gate Computers, Quantum Annealing Computers, Quantum Emulators/Simulators, Quantum Programming)","prerequisites":"Quantum Mechanics, Solid State Physics","texts_and_materials":"Original texts created by the instructor will be distributed.","assessment":"Final Exam: 80%\nHomework: 20%\nRemarks/comments/statements are considered.\n\nThe grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, report, and online tests.
