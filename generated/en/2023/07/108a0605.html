Understanding classification, basic concepts, design metrics, deadlock and starvation, and routing algorithms of interconnection networks from the technical and engineering aspects is evaluated. In case of the online classes, the grade evaluation premises all attendances, and the attitude to learn and the presentation are comprehensively evaluated. Standard study time set by the our university is required to get the grade.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Interconnection Network, Parallel Computer, Message Exchange, Deadlock","office_hours":"As needed.
