Especially, we have been working on plasmonic metamaterials, which enable us to control the light characteristics such as absorption, reflection, scattering, and index. Our objective is the enhancement of photo-electric device performance and photo-functional materials by proper manipulation of light.\n","expected_learning":"The achievement criteria are\nto be able to explain purpose of your research and to propose a novel research otpics.\nto be able to think a practical approach for the research and finish the research initiaitively.\nto be able to publish research article and discuss it.","course_schedule":"We have one research meeting and one paper reading seminar in a week.
