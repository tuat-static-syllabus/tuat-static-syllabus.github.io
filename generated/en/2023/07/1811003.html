Students attend tutorial under a triplet research supervision scheme: one academic principal supervisor and two co-supervisors. In addition, the course trains students in each aspect of research, namely, comprehension, analysis, and implementation, which require a higher level of competency, through discussions with supervisors. The course helps students acquire consensus-building skills and the capacity to adapt to diverse value systems and environments, while leveraging new ideas, knowledge, and information obtained through meaningful academic exchanges with researchers not only in their specialized fields but also from other disciplines, into the design of their doctoral dissertation research.\nInterdisciplinary Seminars consist of the three parts noted below:\n\n1. Tutorial under Triplet Research Supervision Scheme\nStudents take seminars tutorially by academic principal supervisor. While holding regular seminars with an academic principal supervisor, students attend seminars provided by co-supervisor or laboratory work. Students are expected to actively engage in discussions with the co-supervisors and research laboratory members and in communicating their own experience, analytical approach, and ideas.\n\n2. Workshop\nDiscussions with the principal supervisor and the two co-supervisors will be held to help students clarify the academic contributions of their research, narrow down their research themes, and improve their doctoral dissertation research plans in consideration of opinions of faculty members in other disciplines.\n\n3. Academic Literacy provided by the three universities (TUFS, UEC and TUAT)\nThe lecture trains students that enable to acquire the basic skills on scientific writing, presentation and literacy on modern technology at the university level.\n\nAt the end of the course, students will prepare to write a report regarding their research concept for the collaborative humanities and sciences colloquium as part of the \"Advanced Practicum in Sustainability Research I\" Course. Remote videoconference systems or other media may be used as necessary.\n\n----------\n- Academic Literacy Seminar provided by TUFS (online)\nSubject: English Discussion Training Class\nInstructor: SUZUKI, Steven Taro\n\nSummary and goals of the course:\nThe course is designed to improve presentation skills in academic and professional contexts. In order to achieve this goal, higher-level intellectual skills will be developed and improved through engaging in, and performing various tasks and discussions. A natural by- product will be students improving their analytical, rhetorical, and critical thinking skills.\nThese skills are abstract and difficult to measure; however, they are important in terms of being able to collaborate and cooperate effectively with colleagues, superiors, subordinates, and clients in future professions.\n\nOverview of the course:\nStudents will focus on learning important skills for presenting at professional conferences, and also how to adroitly handle Q&A sessions. A short presentation will be conducted by each student in every class. The presentations will start on a basic level, and will increase in analytical and rhetorical difficulty as the course progresses. The course will conclude with a basic full length presentation with a Q&A session performed by each student.\n\n----\n- Academic Literacy Seminar provided by TUAT (online: Google Classroom: Class code lc4uo7j)\nSubject: Basic Statistics\nInstructor: CHITOSE, Atsushi\n\nSummary and goals of the course:\nThe objectives of this course are i) to acquire basic skills of statistical analysis and correct knowledge in dealing with statistics; and ii) to know how to perform basic statistical tests and interpret their results using the Excel worksheets.\n\nOverview of the course:\nThis course will be provided online on Thursday evening in May and June. In each class, students will be given the instruction regarding a special topic by the instructor, followed by the practice for statistical analysis using “Function” and/or “Analysis ToolPak” of Excel.\nNote: Please prepare your own PC, in which Microsoft Excel has been installed.\n\n----\n- Academic Literacy Seminar provided by UEC (online or hybrid)\n1.

Tutorial under Triplet Research Supervision Scheme\nStudents will hold group reading and discussion of important previous research in their specialized fields and other related fields to enhance their competency. In particular, students are expected to deepen their understanding of the various problems that arise during the conduct of their research/experiment as well as of the countermeasures to those problems while incorporating the results of discussions in the seminars into their daily laboratory work and/or research activities.\n\n2. Workshop\nThe workshop is held after lecture of Foundations of Sustainability Research A or B (scheduled on Saturday evening). Students report and hold Q&As on their doctoral dissertation research concepts. Possible dates for the workshop will be\nApril 16th, May 7th, May 14th, and June 4th.\nStudents will make a decision to give a presentation after consulting with academic principal supervisor.\n\n3.
