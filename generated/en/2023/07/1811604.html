Students will train and receive guidance from persons-in-charge at host institutions regarding the operations and methods used at domestic and international institutions. Students will undergo internship for at least 80 hours. Students can intern at international institutions, government agencies, NPOs/NGOs, and other public organizations (including research institutions), as well as development consulting firms, multinational manufacturers, and other private companies.","expected_learning":"The main purpose of the course is to establish the foundation for the students to become doctoral degree-holders with advanced capabilities for conducting practical research. In particular, the course will help them nurture an international sense that is founded on universal and practical knowledge and on social significance, and improve and practice internationally competitive skills in practical thinking and communication.","course_schedule":"Students undergo training for at least 80 hours at domestic and international institutions, in order to learn methods for applying internationally acceptable knowledge and techniques by experiencing work and research in actual field situations, hone their practical communication and thinking skills and capabilities by participating in on-site activities, and their responsibilities as experts in their fields. These activities are geared at establishing the foundation for the students to become doctoral degree-holders with advanced research capabilities and the readiness to apply their skills and knowledge in society.\nThe internship will be planned through close coordination between the student and the principal supervisor. Students will select candidate host institutions based on the their specialization and future career plan with the advice and support from the assistant supervisors, request and negotiate with the host institutions, and decide the period, location, training content, etc. with the approval of the principal supervisor.\nBefore the internship, the students will prepare a proposed plan (approx. two A4 sheets of paper) in consultation with the person-in-charge at the host institution, and finalize the plan through discussions with the principal supervisor.\nAfter completing the internship, the students will submit a report (approx. five A4 sheets of paper) summarizing the training content and achievements to the principal supervisor.
