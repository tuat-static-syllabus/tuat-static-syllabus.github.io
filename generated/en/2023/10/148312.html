Do not just listen to what I say or what textbooks say, but listen critically during the class.\n- The possibilities of microbiology are infinitive. I hope to introduce you to microorganisms’ possibilities, thinking that there are many unknown microorganisms in the natural world. I would like you to keep asking questions during the lecture.\n","course_keywords":"biodegradation, bioremediation, kinetic model, ecological constraints, microbial food chain","office_hours":"10-12 a.m., weekdays","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/14/2023 5:50:35 PM","name":{"id":969,"ja":"環境微生物学特論","en":"Advanced Environmental Microbiology"},"instructor":{"id":189,"ja":"多羅尾 光徳","en":"TARAO Mitsunori"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering(Doctor)","category":"courses for the doctral program","department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Fri.2","references":"\nD.L.
