They will deepen their understanding of basic knowledge related to the theme, learn how to prepare a research plan, conduct experiments and put the research findings in order, and rearrange the survey contents into an overview. In this process, such criteria of scrutiny as the significance of problem solving, effectiveness of the problem solving method and the logic of configuration will be clearly defined, and guidance will be given as to how the overview is to be put together and how to deliver the presentation. Further, the presentation will be delivered orally, its contents will be discussed from a scientific point of view, and the students will learn how to understand a presented paper both affirmatively and critically to learn about the method of research presentation.","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours in classes and time required for completing assignments, students are recommended to prepare for and review the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references.","texts_and_materials":"Suggesting in the lectures","assessment":"Evaluating based on the resume (50%) and presentation (50%).","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Lunch time (Take an appointment by E-mail)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/1/2023 12:28:14 PM","name":{"id":634,"ja":"化学工学基礎演習Ⅰ","en":"Basic Chemical Engineering Practice Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":428,"ja":"布施 元","en":"FUSE Motoi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering(Doctor)","category":"The Professional Degree Program of Industrial Technology and Innovation","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Organization for the Advancement of Education and Global Learning","office":"","day_period":"Fri.3～5","references":""}}
