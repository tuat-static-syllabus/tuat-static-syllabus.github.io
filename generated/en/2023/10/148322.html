Studying this mechanism can be a useful hint for human science.\nWhile insects and humans have been regarded as entirely evolutionarily different organisms, but insects have many genes that are very similar to humans. Besides, they have a physiological and metabolic system common to humans. In this lecture, We will introduce advanced insect researches by the instructors and application examples.\nParticipants will deepen their understanding by discussing whether insects can be useful for the industry in the future.\n\n","expected_learning":"To obtain knowledge of Entomology, and this knowledge can be applied to industry.\nYou can access to https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1.
