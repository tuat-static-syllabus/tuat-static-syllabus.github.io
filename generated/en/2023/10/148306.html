The purpose of this lecture is to focus on human higher levels of brain functions, especially focusing on “body maps” and learning the basic principles of human movement behavior in everyday life.\n\n<Outlines>\nRead the text explaining \"Body Map\", select the topic you are interested in from the contents, and research the latest case studies of the topic. Through presentations and discussions that summarize these surveys, we will deepen our understanding of the relationship between human perception and motor control principles and health.","expected_learning":"The course goals are follows.\n1) To acquire a sense of researcher who can discuss health problem and health improvement from the viewpoint of human behavioral levels.\n2) To acquire the ability to discuss not only the main problems in their research fields but also \"human health problems\" from a broad perspective with researchers from different fields.","course_schedule":"1st week: Introduction: Evolution theory-oriented approach to motor behavior.
