They will deepen their understanding of basic knowledge related to the theme, learn how to prepare a research plan, conduct experiments and put the research findings in order, and rearrange the survey contents into an overview. In this process, such criteria of scrutiny as the significance of problem solving, effectiveness of the problem solving method and the logic of configuration will be clearly defined, and guidance will be given as to how the overview is to be put together and how to deliver the presentation. Further, the presentation will be delivered orally, its contents will be discussed from a scientific point of view, and the students will learn how to understand a presented paper both affirmatively and critically to learn about the method of research presentation.","prerequisites":"Students are recommended to prepare for each subject and revise the lecture, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"None specified.","assessment":"All the instructors will evaluate the abstract (30%), and the performance of presentation and discussion (70%).","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Workday from 13-17 pm.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/1/2023 12:25:13 PM","name":{"id":765,"ja":"有機材料化学実験Ⅳ","en":"Experiments of Organic Materials ChemistryⅣ"},"instructor":{"id":144,"ja":"福原 敏行","en":"FUKUHARA Toshiyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering(Doctor)","category":"courses for doctoral programs","department":"Applied Biological Science, Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences, Ecoregion Science, Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Tue.3～5","references":"None specified."}}
