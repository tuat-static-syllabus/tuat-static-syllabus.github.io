Methods for synthesizing natural and artificial biomolecules using these reactions are also addressed. The latest chemical biology methods for the design of functional biomolecules and their applications in biological research and drug discovery will be introduced. In addition, we will deepen our understanding of the interactions of natural products and drugs with proteins and nucleic acids, and of the basic mechanisms by which drugs work. Quiz-type assignments will be given in each lecture. Through this lecture, students will learn how to use the electron arrows to understand reactions.\n","expected_learning":"Understand the structure and reaction properties of glycans, nucleic acids, amino acids, and natural products.

How can we synthesize biomolecules? By using organic synthesis, it is possible to synthesize artificial biomolecules with new designs and to express desired biological functions. How do drugs work? Understanding why drugs work and the mechanisms by which they work at the molecular level will lead to the discovery of new drugs. Through these lectures, we hope that you will learn the fascination and breadth of organic chemistry, which aims to understand and control life phenomena.","course_keywords":"carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleic acids, natural products","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/4/2023 5:20:49 PM","name":{"id":357,"ja":"バイオマス利用論","en":"Biomass Utilizaition"},"instructor":{"id":328,"ja":"五味 高志","en":"GOMI Takashi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Mon.5","references":"Some texts and Books will be introduced in the course.\n生体有機化学（東京化学同人）、天然物の化学（魅力と展望）（東京化学同人）"}}
