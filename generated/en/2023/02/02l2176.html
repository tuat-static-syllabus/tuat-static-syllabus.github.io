We will study wide range of biotechnology techniques and form the right solution of research data. Topics include organic chemistry practice, physical chemistry practice, molecular biology practice, biochemistry practice, and instrumental analysis.\n\n・Outline of class\nIn molecular biology - biochemistry practice, we will study protein purification method and enzyme characteristics. In organic chemistry - physical chemistry practice, we will study enzyme reaction kinetics and how to use a spectrophotometer. In addition, we will learn NMR and Infrared spectrophotometric measurement in instrumental analysis.\n\nclass code: hqdni7n","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"* Course description\n1.
