In this course, we will learn about differentiation and integration of multivariable functions, such as partial differentiations, criteria of local maxima and minima, double and triple integrations, volumes of solids, line integrations and series. Various computations will be practiced with drawing diagrams.\n\nThis course is taught by a part-time lecturer. Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiation and integration of two, or multivariable functions, and\n(2) to be capable of performing practical computations.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps","course_schedule":"1. Functions of several variables\n2. Ttotal differentiations and differenciations of composite functions\n3. Higher order partial differentiations, and Taylor's theorem\n4.
