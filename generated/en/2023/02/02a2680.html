The students will study hardware architecture of microprocessor including pipelineing using the Z80 CPU, which is a basic processor. In addition, they will learn how a small program is understood by the microprocessor, how each register changes, and how the answer is obtained.\n","expected_learning":"(1) Being equipped with the basic knowledge about microprocessor architecture,\n(2) Understanding how simple microprocessers (e.g. Z-80) work with machine instructions, and\n(3) Being able to make some elementary programs in assembly langueges.","course_schedule":"[ 1] Orientation and introduction to microprocessor\n[ 2] Binary number and Logic circuits\n[ 3] Microprocesser architecture (1)\n[ 4] Microprocessor architecture (2)\n[ 5] Memory, I/O, OS\n[ 6] Think about microprocessors around you!\n[ 7] Parallelizing methods(1)\n[ 8] Parallelizing methods(2)\n[ 9] Assembly languege (1)\n[10] Assembly languege (2)\n[11] Exercises(1)\n[12] Basic examples and programming(1)\n[13] Basic examples and programming(2)\n[14] Exercises (2)\n[15] Final exam","prerequisites":"Computer Programming & Practices, Logic Circuits","texts_and_materials":"Kenji Suda and Masaru Yoda, \"The Base of Microcomputer Application Systems,\" Kyoritu Shuppan.","assessment":"Report(40%), Final exam(60%)","message_from_instructor":"Microprocessor has become a tool and a basic knowledge in any fields.
