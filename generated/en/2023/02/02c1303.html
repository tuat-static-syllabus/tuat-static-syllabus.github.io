Once the employment is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.>>\n\nAfter reviewing the basics of harmonic oscillation, its principal is applied to understand coupled oscillation and normal oscillation. Then we learn about the phenomena of wave motion. With the one-dimensional wave, important phenomena such as reflection, standing wave, and natural vibration are explained. We further proceed to two and three-dimensional waves, where Huygens' principle, refraction, and diffraction are important topics to understand. Frequent mentions are to be made about the application to the physical phenomena in our daily life and the connections to material science.\n\nThis course is a part of physics courses classified as specialized basic subjects in the Department of Applied Chemistry.","expected_learning":"1.
