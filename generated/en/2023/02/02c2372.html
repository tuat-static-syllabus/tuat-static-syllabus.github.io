The lecture will give the basic knowledge on coordination compounds (kinds, nomenclature and functional properties) and their reaction mechanisms. Fundamental theory (ligand field theory) and new fields of coordination chemistry (organometallic and bioinorganic chemistry) will be also introduced and explained by using some practical examples.","expected_learning":"1.
