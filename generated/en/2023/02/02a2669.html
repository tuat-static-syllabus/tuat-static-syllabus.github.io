These features are clarified.\n(3)Equivalent circuit (1): By using h-parameters, amplifications are derived for various kinds of circuits.\n(4)Equivalent circuit (2): Through exercises, the physical meaning is investigated.\n(5)Input and output impedances and matching: Input and out impedances are derived for circuits to get power effectively.\n(6)For midterm examination, we carry out exercises for midterm examination.\n(7)Midterm examination\n(8)Bias circuits and stability factors (1): In order to operate the transistor, bias voltages mast be inputted. Showing these circuits, an operational analysis is carried out.\n(9)Bias circuits and stability factors (2): By using stability factors, functions to be hold are clarified.\n(10)Class A and Class B amplifiers: Difference between class A and B about bias voltage is investigated. Next, collector efficiencies are derived.\n(11)Direct coupled amplifier (1): In order to reject drift, differential circuits are introduced.\n(12)Direct coupled amplifier (2): By introducing the AC equivalent circuit from the real differential circuit, the common mode and differential mode gains are derived.\n(13)Filter circuits using operational amplifier: Showing the structures of differential circuit, integral circuit, phase lead / lag circuit, and Butterworth circuit, these transfer functions are derived.\n(14)Frequency response depiction: By using broken-line approximation, the frequency response with gain and phase is depicted. We carry out drawing exercises on semi-log graph.\n(15)For final examination, we carry out exercises for final examination.\n\nFinal examination during the test period\n","prerequisites":"Students are expected to have the standard amount of time to prepare for and review the lecture as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Oshiyama, Aikawa, Tsuji, Kubota: Electronic Circuits(Corona Ltd.)","assessment":"Evaluating by Final exams.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Transistor, Operational amplifier, Grounded circuit, Equivalent circuit, Linear amplifier","office_hours":"Office Hour: Every Monday 13:00-15:00 Place: 5-201","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"6/7/2023 1:31:52 PM","name":{"id":280,"ja":"ドイツ語入門Ⅱ","en":"German for Beginners Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":259,"ja":"野尻 昌信","en":""},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Fri.1","references":""}}
