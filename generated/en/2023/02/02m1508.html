In this course, the study of discrete systems is limited to those whose configurations are described with one displacement or angle variable, so called One-degree of freedom motion. We will describe the free vibration of particles and forced vibration of particles which are subdivided into un-damped and damped motion categories. Then, we will discuss the vibration of rigid bodies. Finally, an energy approach to the solution of vibration problems and several applications relevant to mechanical machineries, e.g. motors, rotational machines, etc. including vibration measurement and control are also introduced.","expected_learning":"1. The students can derive the equation of motion of the one-degree-of-freedom mass spring damper system and find the solutions.\n2. The students can calculate the natural frequency and the damping ratio of free vibration system.\n3. The students can calculate the magnification ratio of the forced vibration system including the applications of the mechanical machineries.\n4. The students understand the principle of seismic instruments and the automotive suspension vibration characteristics and vibration control.\n","course_schedule":"1-2.
