In particular, current topical subjects and health problems are often related to nervous system, endocrine system, immunology and plant stress response. Focusing on cellular communication in such topical subjects, this lecture course aims to develop skills to discuss such topics and research questions in English. Students will work on thought problems, and describe and discuss their own ideas and interpretations. Such exercise and discussion opportunities are designed for students to learn and practice English phrases and expressions that are frequently used in explaining biological processes, functional interactions and regulatory mechanisms, as well as identifying similarities and differences of biological systems in function and effect.","expected_learning":"1.
