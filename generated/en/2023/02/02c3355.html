Students will learn the essential ideas of electrochemistry such as electrolytic double layer, electrode potential, and electrode kinetics, and will be challenged to apply them to electrochemical reactions for batteries and solar cells. During each lecture, much emphasis will be put on solving exercises in textbook, which will help students to deepen understandings of the concept of each chapter.\nGoogle Classroom Code: rnwyong","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Orientation\nWeek 2: Introduction energy and equilibrium chemistry (chapter 1)\nWeek 3: Standard electrode potential-1 (chapter 2)\nWeek 4: Standard electrode potential-1 (chapter 2)\nWeek 5: Electric double layer & Nernst equation-1(chapter 3)\nWeek 6: Nernst equation-2 (chapter 3)\nWeek 7: Summary of the first three chapters (chapter 0-3)\nWeek 8: Photon electrochemistry; photosynthesis- electrochemical process occurs in nature-(chapter 4 and 5)\nWeek 9: Chemical reaction pathway (chapter 6)\nWeek 10: Electrode reaction pathway (chapter 7)\nWeek 11: What is activation energy (chapter 8)\nWeek 12: Flow of molecules and ions (chapter 9)\nWeek 13: Summary of chapters 4 to 6 (chapter 4-6)\nWeek 14: Surface electrochemical reaction (chapter 10)\nWeek 15: Summary of chapters 7 to 10 (chapter 7-10)\n\n","prerequisites":"Students are strongly recommended to take Physical Chemistry I and II in advance.","texts_and_materials":"「電子移動の化学」-電気化学入門-　渡辺正、中林誠一郎著（日本化学会編/朝倉書店）","assessment":"The mini-tests and reports given in each class will be evaluated comprehensively for 15 points, and the mid-term exam and final exam will be evaluated for 85 points.\n\n\n2021Y　S9.7% A25.8% B35.5% C22.6% D6.5%\n2022Y　S14.3% A35.7% B25.0% C14.3% D10.7%","message_from_instructor":"Attendance at every lecture, preparations, and reviews are recommended.","course_keywords":"Energy, electrode potential, diffusion, electrolytic double layer, batteries","office_hours":"After finishing lecture ~ 17:00","remarks_1":"For questions regarding classes, please contact toshi@cc.tuat.ac.jp","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/4/2023 2:47:49 PM","name":{"id":332,"ja":"地域パートナーシップ論","en":"Partnerships for Community Development"},"instructor":{"id":285,"ja":"岡崎 伸","en":"OKAZAKI Shin"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Thu.2","references":""}}
