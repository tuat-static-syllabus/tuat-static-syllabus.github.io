Especially, you will be able to calculate the electric field and potential, and understand the fundamental principle of steady electric field.\n\nSee the curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1st.: Background of Electromagnetism, and introduction.\n2nd: Review of vector analysis. Unit and Coulomb’s law on point charges.\n3rd: Practices on electric field and the calculation method.\n4-5th: Gauss’ law and divergence. Calculation method of electric field by Gauss’ law.\n6th: Electric field inside and the surface of conductors\n7-8th: Relationship between the electric field and potential. Calculation method of electric potential.\n9th: Electric dipole and the electric field. Lecture of electric field in conductors with holes and shielding.\n10th: Electrostatic energy.\n11th: Dielectric materials and polarization. Gauss’ law and boundary conditions for the case including dielectric materials.\n12th: Practices on the calculation of electric field in dielectric materials.\n13th: Capacitance and the calculation method.\n14th: Fundamental principle in steady electric field.
