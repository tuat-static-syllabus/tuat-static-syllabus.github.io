Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.>>\n\nQuantum chemistry is a field of physical chemistry that examines various properties of molecules theoretically and experimentally based on quantum mechanics which is completely different from classical mechanics. In this lecture, you will learn the basic principle of quantum mechanics as well as the fundamental about the quantum theory of translation, vibration, and rotation of molecules. Then you can understand the nature of quantum chemistry and spectroscopic principles of atoms and molecules. Therefore, this lecture is the basis of the contents of \"Quantum chemistry II\" and \"Structural chemistry\".\n\nGoogle Classroom code: b4623li","expected_learning":"(1) Understanding the difference of physical description in classical mechanics and quantum mechanics.\n(2) Understanding of the wavefunction, Hamilton operator, and Schroedinger equation.\n(3) Calculating the Schroedinger equation in simple cases and finding the corresponding wavefunction and energy level.\n(4) Understanding of the quantization of the translational, vibrational and rotational energies.\n\nDiploma Policy Perspective of the Department: Please refer to the curriculum map of the course guide.","course_schedule":"1.
