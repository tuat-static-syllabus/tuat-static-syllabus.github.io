Once the employment is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.>>\n\nIn the first part, learn the Gauss' theorem and Poisson's equation to understand electrostatic phenomena. Give an understanding on the relationship between electric charge, electric field, and electrical potential. In the second part, learn the relationship between electrical current and magnetic field. Understand that the electric current generates magnetic field, and then magnetic field generates electromotive force.\n\nThis course is a part of physics courses classified as specialized basic subjects in the Department of Applied Chemistry.","expected_learning":"1.
