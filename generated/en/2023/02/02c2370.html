Understanding unique properties of each element based on the periodic table and the electron configurations can lead to development of new materials and finding of novel physical properties. Voluntary efforts to survey literatures on elements and compounds that interest you are desired for further understanding.","course_keywords":"Periodic law of elements, Periodic table, Main group elements","office_hours":"Prof. Kazuyuki Maeda (Building 1: N413) Anytime","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/9/2023 2:51:53 PM","name":{"id":326,"ja":"ECO-TOPインターンシップⅡ","en":"Internship for ECO-TOP Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":303,"ja":"劉 念麟","en":""},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"undefined.4","references":"Basic Inorganic Chemistry, 3rd Edition (Cotton/Wilkinson/Gauss)\n"}}
