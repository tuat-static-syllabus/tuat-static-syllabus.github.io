In this lecture, we will study about X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and spectroscopic analysis.","expected_learning":"(1) Systematically understand the principles of X-ray generation, crystal structure identification by thin-film X-ray diffraction and powder X-ray diffraction.\n(2) Understanding the surface analysis, elemental analysis, and emission analysis using electron microscopes and scanning probe microscopes.\n(3) Understanding of the interaction between electromagnetic waves and substances in spectroscopic analysis. Systematically understanding of all analytical methods using light.\n\nPlease refer to the curriculum map in the course guide for the curriculum policy of this course.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"#1 Introduction\n#2 X-ray diffraction 1: Generation and properties of X-ray\n#3 X-ray diffraction 2: Periodicity of crystal and prinples of X-ray diffraction\n#4 X-ray diffraction 3: Thin film XRD and powder XRD\n#5 Electron microscopy 1: Various methods of surface analysis using various probe\n#6 Electron microscopy 2: Principles and construction of scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy\n#7 Electron microscopy 3: Various analysis using electron microscopy\n#8 Scanning probe microscopy: AFM, STM, SNOM\n#9 Exercise 1\n#10 Spectroscopic analysis 1: Interaction between electromagnetic wave and materials\n#11 Spectroscopic analysis 2: Lambert-Beer's law, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and absorption measurement\n#12 Spectroscopic analysis 3: Calculation and analysis using Lambert-Beer's law and Additive property of Absorbance\n#13 Spectroscopic analysis 4: Photoluminescence, Chathodoluminescence, Photo absorption, Ellipsometry and so on\n#14 Spectroscopic analysis 5: Recent progress in the intrumental analysis\n#15 Exercise 2\nTerm-end exam","prerequisites":"The course will proceed assuming that students understand the contents of the lectures on physical chemistry and inorganic chemistry that were opened by the fourth semester of the second grade.\n\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for\nand review the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and\nusing the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Materials will be distributed as needed. In addition, PowerPoint files used in the lecture will be released from the Moodle system.
