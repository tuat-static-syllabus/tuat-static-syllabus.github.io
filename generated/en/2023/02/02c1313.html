Organic Chemistry II is a part of Organic Chemistry course which consists of Organic Chemistry I - IV. Organic Chemistry course aims at understanding of fundamentals of organic chemistry. This lecture plays a significantly important role in attainment of diploma policy B.\n\n【Outline】In this lecture, the structures, properties, and reactivity of alkenes, alkynes, alkyl halides, conjugated dienes, and aromatic compounds are discussed. Some of the fundamental concepts in organic chemistry such as “nucleophilic substitution”, “？-elimination”, “kinetic control and thermodynamic control”, “resonance”, and “aromaticity” are also expounded.\nClasscode：avqkpbk","expected_learning":"To understand the structures, properties, and reactivity of alkenes, alkynes, alkyl halides, conjugated dienes, and aromatic compounds and the important concepts related to the chemistry of these compounds.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.
