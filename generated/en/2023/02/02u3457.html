At the same time outlines of ecology and geochemical cycles of major elements will be explained. We will learn how to control air, water and soil pollution and how to reduce release of greenhouse gas based on such basic knowledge.\nClasscode: qj2buyy","expected_learning":"Environmental engineering includes environmental fate, treatment and environmental protection, environmental impact assessment, environmental analysis, environmental planning, and environmental ethics.\n- To understand the concept of mass balance and material cycle and the approach ways with specific and necessary ideas toward a sustainable society.\n- To learn the ways to perform risk assessment and management based on the concept of environmental risk of chemicals for human health.\n","course_schedule":"Generally what environmental engineering is addressed are environmental fate analysis, environmental impact assessment, environmental analysis, environmental planning, environmental control techniques such as air, water and soil pollution. what environmental engineering is addressed, is an environmental ethics, etc..\n\n1) Overview of the causes and solutions of global environmental issues global warming and ozone layer depletion.\n\n2) The history of environmental pollution in Japan. In particular Minamata disease caused by organic mercury and the Itai-Itai disease by cadmium. After the video of Minamata disease, the report may be imposed for pollution case from a view point of environmental ethics as engineers.\n\n3) Energy balance and material balance such as nitrogen and phosphorus from the flask-scale microcosm ecosystem to space ship ecosystem with reference to the \"Finite Ecology\" by Kurihara. Report on the energy metabolism of the microorganism is imposed.\n\n4) Toxicity of dioxin, mechanisms of dioxin generation, countermeasures of dioxin from viewpoint of regulations and control techniques\n\n5) Assessment of environmental risk caused by chemicals and risk management. Concept of environmental standards based on environmental risk and specific evaluation methods. Exercise of risk assessment will be solved.\n\n6) How to handle the experimental data? Learning of zero-order reaction, first-order reaction and non-linear reaction like saturation-type reaction as basic knowledge for environmental engineering.\n\n7) Deriving the oxygen balance model of the river and to solve the differential equations.\n\n8) Drinking water treatment process (Disinfection and precipitation as typical unit process).\n\n9) Wastewater treatment process (Activated sludge processes as biological treatment and membrane separation as physico-chemical treatmet)\n\n10) Countermeasure technologies and regulations relating to air pollution like sulfur, nitrogen oxides and PM2.5\n\n11) Clean-up technologies including biological and physico-chemical process against soil pollution\n\nFinal exam and midterm exam will be performed.\n","prerequisites":"N/A\n","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Basically performance in mid-term exam and the final exam will be evaluated taking into account of reports and exercises.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"Classcode: qj2buyy","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/19/2023 6:59:54 PM","name":{"id":434,"ja":"歴史学","en":"History"},"instructor":{"id":427,"ja":"福島 康博","en":"FUKUSHIMA Yasuhiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Scleroprotein and Leather Research Institute","office":"","day_period":"Thu.6","references":"Following book is highly recommended as references: Iwanami Shoten \"Ecology Finite\" Yasushi Kurihara.
