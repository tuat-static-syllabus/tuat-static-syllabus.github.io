Cell regenerative technology is an applied subject of the special field of biotechnology, and it is a specialized subject of life science. The purpose of this lecture is to understand the latest research content concerning various transplantation.\nWe learn about the basis of cell regeneration and latest research contents related to various transplantation. Students are encouraged to study using data provided in the class to build a systematic understanding on the cell regenerative technology.\n\nBiomedical cell engineering\nIn the field of biomedical cell engineering, we introduce examples of restoring cellular functions by targeting mitochondria and implementing modifications and transplants (mitochondrial engineering). Mitochondria are cellular organelles associated with many diseases, and various techniques used in bioengineering are utilized for their application. From the perspective of bioengineering, we will explain how to utilize mitochondria.Mitochondria have been implicated in a wide range of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, oxidative stress, ischemia-reperfusion injury (damage that occurs after blood flow is restored following organ transplantation or myocardial infarction), immunity, and inflammation. We will present examples that focus on mitochondria to understand how to suppress cellular abnormalities observed in these diseases. In addition, we will consider the novel approach of organelle transplantation.\n\nclass code : m3ujfj6","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand the contents and problems of latest research on cell regenerative technology.\nThis subject is associated with the corresponding criteria B, C in the Diploma Policy.","course_schedule":"1.
