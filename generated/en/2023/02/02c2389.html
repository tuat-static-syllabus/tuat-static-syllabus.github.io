In these sessions, you will conduct the experiments about fundamental molecular transformations of organic compounds and the measurements of polymer properties. Students have to write a report after each session. The lab sessions introduce students to the basic techniques used in organic chemistry laboratories and the basic experiments for investigation about polymer structure and properties. The lectures will cover the knowledge about the chemical properties of poisonous and deleterious substances. Moreover, you will learn how to manage hazardous materials, and the relevant laws to develop an understanding of safe experiments and legal compliance.\n\nGoogle Classroom code: o6chxg7","expected_learning":"A large number of organic substances are essential for our daily life. Although some of them can be available from nature, these are largely synthesized by chemical reactions.\nUpon completion of this course, students should engage in safe laboratory practices by handling laboratory glassware, equipment, chemical reagents, and products appropriately through the lab sessions.\nIn the organic chemistry lab sessions, students will also acquire basic synthetic methods for organic compounds and searching skills for chemical and physical properties of reagents, starting materials, and products.\nIn the polymer chemistry lab sessions, students will understand the properties of polymers, which are the indispensable materials of life.
