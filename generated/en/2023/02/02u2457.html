An overview of the acidity of organic compounds and organic reactions.\nPart 2: Nucleophilic addition to carbonyl groups. Explain the nucleophilic addition reaction of aldehyde ketones.\nPart 3: Nucleophilic Substitution of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives. The structure of a carboxylic acid derivative is shown and typical reactions are described.\nPart 4: Hydride reduction of carbonyl compounds and the Grignard reaction\nPart 5: Stereochemistry and Nucleophilic Substitution of Haloalkanes. SN1 and SN2 mechanisms are explained, and many reaction examples are taken up.\nPart 6: Elimination of haloalkanes. The E1 and E2 mechanisms are explained.\nPart 7 and Part 8: Alcohol chemistry, Explain the structure and reactivity of alcohols.\nPart 9: Chemistry of ether epoxides. The reaction of ethers, especially epoxides, is explained.\nPart 10: Reviewing electrophilic additions to alkenes. We review the outline of the addition reactions to alkenes that we learned in organic chemistry.\nPart 11: Electrophilic aromatic substitution. An example of electrophilic aromatic substitution is shown, and aromatic compounds are compared with alkenes in terms of reaction.\nPart 12: Enolate ions and their reactions. The chemistry of enolates is reviewed as a new reaction of carbonyl compounds.\nPart 13: Nucleophilic Reactions of Electrophilic Alkenes. Describe the conjugate addition reaction of enolates (equivalent).\nPart 14: Summarize the contents of the lecture and make up for any lack of explanation.\nPart 15: End-of-term studies","prerequisites":"It is desirable to take the class of \"Basic courses in organic chemistry\".","texts_and_materials":"『有機化学 改訂第2版』奥山格，石井昭彦，箕浦真生（丸善出版）","assessment":"The evaluation is mainly based on the final examination and tasks. In addition, quizzes to confirm each student's level of understanding will be conducted as appropriate, but will not be reflected in grades. Mid-term examinations may be conducted depending on the level of understanding of the participants.","message_from_instructor":"The molecular structures and reactions we learn in organic chemistry can be enormous and daunting. However, if you understand some basic concepts, you can organize and understand various structures and reactions. Writing structures and mechanisms yourself is a shortcut to gaining these basic concepts.","course_keywords":"Aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, alkyl halides, alcohols, aromatic compounds","office_hours":"Because I am a part-time lecturer, please ask questions immediately after the lecture.
