We are going to study current, magnetic field / vector magnetic potential by current including their relationship, and steady magnetic field. Then we are going to study time-varying field (electromagnetic induction and displacement current), and electromagnetic waves. Finally, Maxwell’s equations are derived. Practices are included for better understanding.\nclassroom code：fhyfav4","expected_learning":"You will be able to understand steady magnetic field in Electromagnetism.
