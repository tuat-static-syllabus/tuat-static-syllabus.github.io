The purpose of this lecture is to acquire comprehensive knowledge of scientific measurement methods for humans, including the basics of human anatomy and physiology, measurement principles of human morphology, physiology, and motion, and interpretation and utilization of data obtained from measurements.\nIn this lecture, the following three measurement techniques are mainly lectured.\n1. Methods of measurement of human form, structure, and motor function.\n2. Measurements of human bio-electrics (electromyography, electrocardiography, electroencephalography)\n3. Measurement of human central nervous system, autonomic nervous system, and mental functions.","expected_learning":"The objectives of the course are twofold.\n1) To understand the basics of human anatomy and physiology.\n2) To understand the principles of measurement of human science.\nPlease refer to the curriculum map in the course guide.","course_schedule":"Section I.
