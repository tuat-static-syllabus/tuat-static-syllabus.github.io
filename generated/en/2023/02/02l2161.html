It is divided into catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism is the set of metabolic pathways that breaks down molecules into smaller units that are either oxidized to release energy or used in other anabolic reactions. Anabolism is the set of metabolic pathways that construct molecules from smaller units. In this lecture, you will manly study anabolism.\n\nClass code: 3d2qc3j","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1 Apr 11 Introduction\n2 Apr 18 Recent advances in life science 1\n3 Apr 25 The Calvin Cycle\n4 May 2 Recent advances in life science 2 (On Line)\n5 May 9 The Pentose Phosphate Pathway\n6 May 16 Glycogen Metabolism\n7 May 23 Fatty Acid Metabolism\n8 May 30 Protein Turnover 1\n9 June 6 Protein Turnover 2\n10 June 13 Amino Acid Catabolism\n11 June 20 Biosynthesis of Amino Acids\n12 June 27 Recent advances in life science 3\n13 July 4 Biosynthesis of nucleotides\n14 July 11Biosynthesis of Membrane Lipids and Steroids\n15 July 18 Summary","prerequisites":"\"Basic physics\", \"Basic chemistry\", \"Basic biology\" and \"Biochemistry I\" are prerequisites.","texts_and_materials":"Biochemistry (Stryker)","assessment":"End of term exam: 70%.
