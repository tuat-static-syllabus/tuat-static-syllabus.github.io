In this course, we will first introduce basic concepts and terms of statistics such as means, variances, probability distributions, etc. Then, observing the connection between statistical properties of samples and those of the population, we will learn methods of interval estimation and hypothesis testing.\n\nThis course is taught by a part-time lecturer. Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is to be capable of\n(1) understanding standard terms and notations of mathematical statistics,\n(2) calculating the mean and standard deviation of a given set of numbers,\n(3) applying normal distribution or Student's t-distribution to estimation of the mean of the population,\n(4) testing a statistical hypothesis by using normal distribution.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"Google Classroom will be used for quizzes and assignments.\n\n1. Means and variances, standard deviations (pp.6-7, pp.10-14, pp.18-21)\n2. Random variables, distribution functions (pp.34-40)\n3. Joint random variables (pp.42-43, p.47)\n4. Covariances and correlation coefficients (pp.22-25, pp.48-49)\n5. Means and variances of the sum of random variables, independence (pp.44-52)\n6. Binomial distribution and normal distribution (pp.54-58)\n7. Applications of normal distribution, Poisson distribution (pp.59-63)\n8. Sampling distributions, the central limit theorem (pp.74-81)\n9. Interval estimations I, unbiased variance (pp.82-87)\n10. Student's t-distribution, interval estimations II (p.67, pp.84-90)\n11-12. Hypothesis tests (pp.92-102, pp.109-110)\n13. Equal mean hypothesis (pp.102-105)\n14. Chi-square tests and independence tests (pp.112-119)\n15.
