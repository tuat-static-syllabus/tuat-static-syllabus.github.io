Therefore, it is an indispensable subject for those who study chemistry, and it is one of the subjects classified into the basic specialized subjects of the Department of Applied Chemistry. The goal of this course is to learn how to apply the theory of thermodynamics, which students should have learned through Physical chemistry I, into actual chemical phenomena (material characteristics, chemical reactions etc…). Students will especially learn the concept of equilibrium through this course. Much emphasis will be put on the improvements of student's English skills as well. For example, vocabulary tests will be conducted at the beginning of each lecture. Additionally, several workshops are scheduled to deepen understandings of the concept of each chapter through the exercises in the textbook.\nGoogle classcode: lti6ege","expected_learning":"You can understand a basic theory of equilibrium thermodynamics such as phase equilibrium with one- and multi-component systems with/without chemical changes and the basis of the electrochemical equilibrium.","course_schedule":"Course schedule\nWeek 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Lecture (chapter 4), Physical Transformation of Pure Substances I\nWeek 3: Lecture (chapter 4), Physical Transformation of Pure Substances II\nWeek 4: Exercises (chapter 4)\nWeek 5: Summary (chapter 4)\nExamines (chapter 4)\nWeek 6: Lecture (chapter 5), Simple Mixture I\nWeek 7: Lecture (chapter 5), Simple Mixture II\nWeek 8: Lecture (chapter 5), Simple Mixture III\nWeek 9: Exercises (chapter 5-1)\nWeek 10: Exercises (chapter 5-2)\nWeek 11: Summary (chapter 5)\nExamines (chapter 5)\nWeek 12: Lecture (chapter 6), Chemical Equilibrium I\nWeek 13: Lecture (chapter 6), Chemical Equilibrium II\nWeek 14: Exercises (chapter 6)\nWeek 15: Summary (chapter 6)\nExamines (chapter 6)","prerequisites":"Students are strongly recommended to take Physical Chemistry I in advance.","texts_and_materials":"Atkins' Physical Chemistry\nOxford University Press","assessment":"The grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates mini examinations, reports, and tests. Standard study time set by our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows: normal score 10% (evaluate mainly on English word test and mini exam efforts and correct answer rate in each class), exercise 20% (evaluate mainly on approach to exercises and answers, correct answer rate), comprehensive evaluation of grades is based on a test score of 70% (evaluating mainly on the basics of thermodynamic equilibrium theory, application of knowledge, and understanding of specific cases). Grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.","message_from_instructor":"Attendance at every lecture, preparations, and reviews are recommended.","course_keywords":"Thermodynamics, chemical equilibrium,","office_hours":"After finishing lecture ~ 17:00","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/28/2023 12:53:16 PM","name":{"id":323,"ja":"地域生態システム学Ⅲ","en":"Ecoregion Science III"},"instructor":{"id":295,"ja":"川端 良子","en":"KAWABATA Yoshiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Institute of Global Innovation Research","office":"","day_period":"Tue.3","references":""}}
