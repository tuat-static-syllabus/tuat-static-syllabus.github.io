Then students make parts of the stirling engine operating a machine tool by themselves under guidance of teacher and teaching assistant, and assemble them and set the stirling engine in motion.\n(2) Students should be able to understand the working theory of the stirling engine properly based on the thermodynamics.\n(3) Students should be able to understand the knowledge about the safety of varieties of machine tool properly, and process parts safely.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n\n","course_schedule":"1. Principle and motion of the stirling engine\n\n2. Production practice using varieties of machine tool\n2.1 　Lath, CNC Multitasking Machine\n2.2 　Milling machine, Machining Center, CNC Multitasking Machine\n2.3 　Wire electric discharge machine, Fine cutter\n2.4 　Injection Molding Machine・Die and mold\n2.5 　Drilling machine\n\n3. Assembling and adjustment\nStudents assemble machined parts and adjust them to work their stirling engine actually.\n","prerequisites":"　The textbook used in this production practice will be used as a teaching material in a CAD exercise of upper-class. Keep it carefully until its using.","texts_and_materials":"　The textbook can be bought in a cooperative store of a university. Materials of work are distributed freely.","assessment":"　Performance is evaluated at the degree of perfection and production state of stirling engine produced according to schedule, the contents of report and deadline for submission and the attitude in practice, etc.","message_from_instructor":"　The newest machine tools have been installed. Please enjoy “Mono-zukuri” by touching, looking at, listening to and smelling them.\n　If you would be late for lesson or be absent from that, you would not complete your stirling engine owing to the lack of parts.\n　The power of concentration is needed because the practice involves danger works. Come to the practice in perfect physical condition and pay attentions to the safety carefully.\n　The experience of “Mono-zukuri” will become your very important background when you will learn the design, drawing, and major subject (theory) in the future.\n　There is hardly any factory fully equipped like our factory in other universities. And we think that such a full-scale practice making object by hand and machine like our practice is very rare. We hope you will find this lessons worthy and useful!\n\n","course_keywords":"“Mono-zukuri”, Craftsmanship, Processing, Working, Machine tool, Assembling, Stirling engine, Safety","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"　The safety has the highest priority in the job site of making object by hand and machine . Great attention to the safety of work should be paid. Listen to attentions from a leader attentively, and work safely. Using sandals is strictly prohibited. Don’t hang your shirttail out. Wear goggles for safety.","remarks_2":"　If you would be late for lesson or be absent from it, you would not complete your stirling engine owing to the lack of parts. Take care of the health care, try enough not to be absent and not to be late.","related_url":"https://classroom.google.com/c/NTk5OTA4NDMwNzE2?cjc=tz4oqxu","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/20/2023 10:14:10 AM","name":{"id":385,"ja":"地域環境社会学","en":"Environmental Sociology"},"instructor":{"id":339,"ja":"梶 光一","en":"KAJI Koichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Mon.3～5,Thu.3～5","references":"　Refer to many reference books published about machine work mechanics, machine production, production processing."}}
