The properties of materials are based on the properties of constituting atoms and their reactions, i.e. bonding. In this lecture, the structure and periodical characteristics of atoms, several chemical bonding between atoms, and reaction and properties of several inorganic materials are explained.\nThis course is a part of inorganic and analytical chemistry courses classified as specialized basic subjects in the Department of Applied Chemistry.\n\nClass code:","expected_learning":"Understand the structures of atoms and molecules, and the structure and reactions of liquids and solids from the view point of inorganic chemistry.\n\nFor the curriculum policy perspective of this course, please refer to the curriculum map in the Faculty of Engineering Course Guide.","course_schedule":"(1) Introduction: What is inorganic chemistry\n(2)-(4) \"Text Chapter 2\"\nAtomic structure: Bohr model, quantization, wave function\nPeriodic law: Electron configuration and properties of atoms / ions\n(5)-(7) \"Text Chapter 3\"\nMolecular structure: localized binding approximation and basis of molecular orbital theory\n(8) Summary of atomic structures and molecular structures\nIntermediate Exam\n(9)&(10) \"Text Chapter 4\" and \"Appendix 1\"\nIonic solids: crystal lattice and lattice energy\nSymmetry of molecules and crystals: symmetry operations and symmetry elements\n(11)-(13) \"Text Chapters 5 to 7\"\nPolyatomic anions: structure and chemistry\nFundamentals of coordination chemistry: structure, reactivity and stability\nSolvents: Classification Properties\nAcid/Base: Classification and Strength\n(14) \"Text Chapter 8\" and others\nPolyatomic molecules and solids: structures and properties\nApplication of inorganic chemistry: inorganic substances as industrial materials\n(15) Final Exam","prerequisites":"It is indispensable contents of lessons to be taken for 2nd year inorganic chemistry II and III.\nIn addition to 30 hours you spend in the class, you are expected to prepare for and review the classes as above, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Text \"Shriver / Atkins: Inorganic Chemistry 6th Edition”\nIn addition handouts are given in the lecture.","assessment":"Standard study time set by our university is required to get the grade.
