Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.\n\n\n\nStudents who have studied mechanical engineering at universities can work as engineers for research and development, design, manufacturing, quality assurance, etc. What is commonly required in such fields is 'the ability to create all the information needed to realize a certain function'. That is the ability to design in the broad sense.\nThe purpose of this lecture is to learn the design procedures through design calculations and statistical methods (concept of variation, correlation, normalization, design of experiments, overview of \"big data\"), and knowledge of drafting with regard to the information as a means of creating technical information about the object and conveying them to others, that is, design policy and design shape.\nIn the first half of this course, students will learn the basic rules for design (drafting instructions, shape determination methods, etc.) and outline of machine elements through lectures based on the textbook and accompanying materials. In the second half, students will practice design calculations, use of statistical methods, procedures of creating reports, and preparation of design calculations based on actual examples experienced by the lecturer.\n\n<Precautions for choosing course>\nThere are several courses named \"Mechanical Systems Design and Drawing\" other than this course. In principle, students will be assigned their classes based on their course (M1 or M2).\nIt is possible to change the class if there is a special reason, such as a time conflict with the class you are planning to take.\nPlease refer to Remark 1 for how to refer to the assignment list.\n","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand how to read and draw mechanical drawings, and to be able to design machines based on their own ideas.","course_schedule":"1. Introduction of lecture and fundamentals of drawing\n\n2. Writing of dimension and surface roughness and drawing training\n\n3.

Drawing of bearing, seal and gear, and calculation practice and drawing training\n\n6. Drawing method of pipe, spring, and calculation practice and drawing training\n\n7. Material notation, processing method, multi-variable analytical theory (correlation, normalization, performance approximation, etc.)\n\n8. Introduction to Design of Experiments, Strength design(1) e.g. Bolt tightening\n\n9.
