The goal of this course is to introduce basic wave physics and its applications for both physics and non-physics students. The main topics to be covered in the lectures include: wave phenomena, electromagnetics, optics and basic quantum physics.\nWe will approach the topics of physics using existing tangible examples that illustrate the relevance of physics to your lives such as wifi, smarphones and cameras, and you will learn how wave physics is used in product designs. We will not spend so much time on studying how to solve complicated equations; instead, we will focus on learning some important simplified models and mathematical concepts to understand a variety of physical phenomena. This course includes interactive group work sessions and opportunities for presentations in English.","expected_learning":"Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:\n- Identify the key physical phenomena in electronic devices around you, and explain how they work.\n- Use simple equations, appropriate diagrams and graphs to describe wave phenomena.\n- Recognize the relations between physics and other disciplines (biology, chemistry, medicine etc.).\n- Gain communication and presentation skills in English, and more importantly, in your own words.\n","course_schedule":"1. Understanding how electronic devices work (display, wifi, camera, sound devices)\n2. Oscillators and waves\n3. Physical quantities in electromagnetics\n4. Electromagnetic spectra (radio waves, light, x-ray)\n5. Electromagnetism (Maxwell’s equations)\n6. How to analyze waves: the concept of Fourier transform\n7. Optics: refraction, interference and diffraction\n8. Optical instruments for biomedical sciences (spectroscopy and microscopy)\n9. Presentation I (mid-term report)\n10. Momentum and energy of electromagnetic waves\n11. Introduction to quantum physics: wave-particle duality\n12. Photons and electrons\n13. Light and matters: absorption and emission spectra\n14. Presentation II (final exam)\n15. Recap\n","prerequisites":"I recommend that you read the reference textbook prior to lecture, but you are not expected to memorize the details.","texts_and_materials":"Reference textbook: OpenStax's University Physics (Volume 1-3)\nDownload for free at \"https://openstax.org/details/books/university-physics-volume-1\"\nLecture handouts and materials will be prepared for each class.\n","assessment":"The final grades for this course will be given based on:\n- final exam (50%)\n- Participation during the lectures: including working in groups, answering questions and quizzes (50%)\n","message_from_instructor":"Through this course, I hope you will become familiar with many exciting topics of physics that drive many innovative electronics products and real-world industrial applications. This multi-disciplinary course offers group work activities with students from other universities. If you have already taken some physics classes, this course will be a great opportunity for you to check your understanding, and explain the physics in your own words. Of course, we also welcome students from other majors. I encourage you to ask any simple questions to me and other students during the class or in office hours. Your simple questions will stimulate the classroom and will make other students realize that what they thought they understood was actually what they didn't.\nI hope you will enjoy the interactions between the three universities!\n","course_keywords":"wave phenomena, electronics, electromagnetics, geometric and wave optics, basic quantum physics","office_hours":"If you have any questions, please contact via email (teru-ito at cc.tuat.ac.jp)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/28/2023 3:43:51 PM","name":{"id":428,"ja":"文学・芸術学","en":"Art and Literature"},"instructor":{"id":394,"ja":"加藤 直樹","en":"KATO Naoki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"general education courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
