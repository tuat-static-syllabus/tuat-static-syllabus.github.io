Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.>>\n\nLearn the concepts and basics of human health risk assessment and ecological risk assessment of chemical substances, and introduce case studies and practice calculations. Not only one-way “lectures” but also opportunities for students to present and discuss with their own heads. In addition, 2 to 3 external speakers will be invited to provide related topics.\nThis lecture will be held by a part-time lecturer Yuichi Iwasaki. Dr. Iwasaki has been involved in ecological impact assessments in metal-contaminated rivers receiving mine discharge, more broadly, studied ecological risk assessment and management for chemicals.\n\nGoogle classroom code: unready","expected_learning":"(1) Understand the human health and ecological risk assessment and management practices of chemical substances\n(2) To acquire a trial and error method to understand daily risks\n\nDiploma Policy Perspective of the Department: Please refer to the curriculum map of the course guide.","course_schedule":"1.
