It allows us to be able to answer a basic question, e.g. what constituents builds up a living organism; how a living organism maintain its activity; and so on. Currently, it contributes to medical and industrial applications with its degree increasing. Throughout this course, a students will be equipped with not only basic contents but also applied contents beneficial as an engineer.","expected_learning":"-Constituents of macromolecules\n-Functions and structures of proteins, nucleic acids, sugars and lipids\n-Essence of metabolisms\n-Enzyme functions and kinetics\n\n","course_schedule":"This course consists of 13 lectures and 2 exams, which will be held in Japanese.
