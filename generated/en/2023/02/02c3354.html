This syllabus is subject to change by the faculty member due to lectures.\n\nComputational chemistry based on the molecular orbital theory is one of the effective methods to investigate properties and reactions of wide variety of molecules. This course provides the basics of molecular orbital method to students familiar with elementary topics of quantum chemistry such as Schroedinger equation and wave function. After carrying out some reviews on matrix calculation and variation method, an introduction will be given to Hartree-Fock equation which is the basics of molecular orbital theory. Students will be able to learn more through some simple analyses with molecular orbital calculation software.\n\nGoogle Classroom code: p2d6qo2\n","expected_learning":"Learners who complete this course will be able to:\n(1) Recognize the basic idea(hypotheses, approximations) of Hartree-Fock method and the outline of the molecular orbital calculation process.\n(2) Understand the basic operation of molecular orbital calculation software for atomic/molecular simulations\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.
