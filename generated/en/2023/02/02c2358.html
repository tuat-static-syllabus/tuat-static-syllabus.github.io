In order to understand the role of such plastic films in LCD TVs, a basic knowledge of optics is necessary. Also, in the glasses-free 3D TVs developed in recent years, the lens sheet plays an important role in displaying stereoscopic images. In this lecture, the principles of optics necessary for the design of optical materials will be explained in an easy-to-understand manner for chemistry students. Students will learn the fundamentals of optics that lead to material and device design mainly for optical fibers, optical waveguides, optical filters, optical diffraction gratings and lenses, and liquid crystal displays.\nGoogle Classroom Code tvh2xbx\n","expected_learning":"1.
