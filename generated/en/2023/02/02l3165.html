Various know-how is necessary to scale up laboratory experiments and to establish production technology at the industrial level. It is the main objective of this lecture to give basic knowledge on bioengineering as the foundation. The content of the lecture ranges from microbial characteristics to fluid dynamics, but by explaining examples, explain so that the actual industrial linkage can be understood.\n\nClass code: uvsatep\n","expected_learning":"1. Learn the basics of biochemical engineering (quantity theory, kinetics, immobilized enzyme, bioreactor).\n2. Build the foundation to know and understand the cutting-edge information on bioprocesses.\n3. Build the foundation to know and understand the cutting-edge information on BioMEMS.\nThis subject is associated with perspective B of the diploma policy.","course_schedule":"1 Apr 10 Introduction (Kawano)\n2 Apr 17 MicroTAS and application for biotechnology (Kawano)\n3 Apr 24 Basics of BioMEMS and MEMS (Kawano)\n4 May 1 Basics of Microfluidic (Kawano)\n5 May 8 Application of BioMEMS 1 (Kawano)\n6 May 15 Application of BioMEMS 2 (Kawano)\n7 May 22 Application of BioMEMS 3 (Kawano)\n8 May 29 Practical bioprocess engineering (Yohda)\n9 June 5 Mass and energy balance (Yohda)\n10 June 12 Mass and heat transfer (Yohda)\n11 June 19 Reaction kinetics of cell (Yohda)\n12 June 26 Bioreactor (Yohda)\n13 July 3 Immobilized biocatalyst (Yohda)\n14 July 10 Bioseparation (Yohda)\n15 July 17 Summary (Yohda)","prerequisites":"Biochemistry 1 and Molecular Biology 1","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Report and Examination","message_from_instructor":"We will give lecture on a wide range of fields from basic to applied.
