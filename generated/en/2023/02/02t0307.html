As a direction for future research, the perspective of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs; Sustainable Development Goals), which consist of 17 goals and 169 targets to realize a sustainable world, is essential. In addition, collaboration with corporations is essential to realize a sustainable society. In order to create a future society together with companies, it is important to promote research that sets goals with a clear focus on targets (exits) with economic and social impact, based on future social and industrial needs.\nIn this lecture, lecturers from Suntory Ltd. in the food industry field will be invited to teach the following topics to begin students in order to deepen their understanding of the concept of creating bio-related innovation through classroom lectures, case studies, and group exercises, and to comprehensively learn about the flow of returning research results to society.\n1. industry-academia collaboration and social implementation\n3. Innovation to create a future society\n5. Open innovation as an innovation creation activity\n6. Summary\nThis course is offered as a Liberal Arts Global Development Course and is taught by faculty members with practical experience. In the class, lectures and exercises will be given on the differences from basic research at universities, the importance of research activities in companies and their commercialization process, and the role of industry-academia collaboration.\n\nLecture starts: 8/25 3-5, 8/26 1-5\n\nClassroom class code: njre5ee","expected_learning":"1) Understand the concept of the SDGs and their role in society, and be able to propose measures to implement initiatives through basic research and industry-academia collaboration with an image of future society.\n2) To be able to think, speak, and discuss independently and autonomously in groups to draw effective conclusions.\nMain objectives: independence/autonomy ◎, leadership/coordination skills ◎, communication ◎, written expression ◎, presentation ◎, problem exploration, problem solving","course_schedule":"Day 1\nPart 1: Guidance, Research in the company: What Suntory values as a business.\nAn explanation of how to proceed with the lecture as a whole and evaluation methods will be given. The lecture will then explain the positioning and importance of industry-academia collaboration between basic research at universities and companies that aim to utilize the results of such research and implement them in society.\n\nSession 2: What is the challenge of in-house R&D departments in companies?\nA researcher from JST will be invited as a guest lecturer to present issues related to science and technology and the SDGs, including terminology, trends in domestic and international initiatives, social implementation through industry-academia collaboration, and ripple effects from the return of results to society.\n\nDay 2\nSession 3: Case Study 1: From material discovery to commercialization\nThe polyphenol business commercialized by Suntory has not only created a health food business category as a new business domain, but has also been commercialized by other food industry companies and established as a new category in the health food domain. Through the case study of the commercialization process from the discovery of the polyphenol material to how it was commercialized, participants will learn and understand specifically what to consider once the material is discovered, including group discussions of about 5 or 6 participants.\n\nSession 4: Case Study 2: Commercialization of a basic research project by converting it from science to engineering\nThis is a case study of Suntory's efforts to find and create a new fundamental technology, and to develop it into the current beer and coffee business, leading to commercialization. How did the company overcome the reality that it is not possible to commercialize the fundamental research capabilities of a company with technology alone, and how did they achieve commercialization? Participants will learn and understand the methods and approaches in concrete terms through group discussions of about 5 or 6 participants.\n\nSession 5: Case Study 3: Case Study of Commercialization of Data Analysis\n　Participants will learn and understand specifically the difficulties of \"information commercialization\" through group discussions of about 5 to 6 participants, with case studies of new DX business creation based on data analysis.\n\nDay 3\nPart 6: Commercialization and Intellectual Property Strategy\n　Research and development based on a company's business strategy/company-wide management strategy creates new products and businesses, and at the same time, intellectual property are created as a result of research activities. Such corporate research is not limited to the company's own independent research, but is conducted in collaboration with domestic and foreign companies, universities, and research institutions. The lecture will explain, with specific examples, what kind of intellectual property is useful from the viewpoint of business management as an intellectual property strategy linked to commercialization, and how to utilize intellectual property to strengthen and expand business.\n\nSession 7: Open Innovation\n　There are various forms of open innovation such as industry-academia, industry-government-academia, and industry-industry, but the purpose is to create business. From the viewpoint of business creation, the lecture will explain from what perspective open innovation activities should be promoted, what methods should be used, and the importance of management skills as well as technology, given the reality that simply conducting joint research between industry and academia does not lead to commercialization.\n\nPart 8: Human Resource Development\n　Explanation of the future of science-based human resources, using Suntory's human resources development as an example. The lecture will explain that engineers who don't only have solid technical knowledge, but also understand the management of research promotion, and those who are ambidextrous in both research and management will be needed, and that they will have a wider range of opportunities to play an active role in the future.","prerequisites":"In addition to the 12 hours of class time, students are required to prepare and review for the course according to the University's standard number of hours using the materials distributed in class.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"(1)　Grading will be based on class participation (class participation), assignment reports, etc., and credits will be awarded when the standardized learning effectiveness set by the university is recognized.\n　Grades will be based on 40% regular points, 30% group presentations, and 30% assignment reports.\nGrading is based on a 5-point system: S: 90 points or above, A: 80 points or above and less than 90 points, B: 70 points or above and less than 80 points,\nC: 60 points or above and less than 70 points, D: Less than 60%\nGrades will not be given to students whose attendance rate is less than 70%, but attendance alone is not considered class participation.\n\nReport Due date: 9/15 till 13:00\nS: ≧90%, >90% A ≧80%, 80> B ≧70%, >70% C ≧60%, 60% > D","message_from_instructor":"esearch integrating agricultural science and engineering is a characteristic of TUAT. The results are implemented in society through industry-academia collaboration. The importance of basic research in this process and the concept of SDGs, which are set goals for social return, will be studied. Furthermore, they will visualize a future society that has achieved these goals and understand cutting-edge efforts to set and solve scientific and technological issues to realize such a society. It is hoped that this lecture will provide knowledge and experience that will be useful for future study in your field of specialization, for setting research themes, and for your future as a member of society.","course_keywords":"SDGs, Innovation, [Industry-Academia Collaboration","office_hours":"If there are any questions or concerns, they will be answered in detention after each class.
