Introduction: how electromagnetism can help us in biomedical engineering\n2. How to describe physical quantities (electric field, magnetic field, charge and current density)\n3. Flux and circulation of vector fields\n4. Maxwell's equations (Gauss', Faraday's and Ampere's laws in integral forms)\n5. Derivatives of a vector field (gradient, divergence and rotation)\n6. Integrals of a vector field (Gauss' theorem and Stokes' theorem)\n7. Maxwell's equations (in differential forms)\n8. Coulomb's law and superposition principle\n9. Electric field and electrostatic potential\n10. Poisson's equation: 2nd derivative of a vector field\n11. Some examples of electric field and potential (point charge, line charge, surface charge, capacitor and cell membrane)\n12. Practicum: report writing and interactive review\n13. Electrostatic energy\n14. Dielectric polarization\n15. Recap and final exam","prerequisites":"You are expected to have the basic understanding of electromagnetism you learned in high-school physics and some fundamental calculus you learned in \"Fundamental Mathematics for Engineering\" held in the spring term.\nIn addition to the course hours, you are strongly encouraged to prepare and review for each lecture.","texts_and_materials":"Susumu Komiyama and Atsushi Takekawa \"Electromagnetics\" Shokabo, Tokyo (in Japanese).","assessment":"The final grades for this course will be given based on:\n- Final exam (60%)\n- Participation during the lectures: including working in groups, answering questions and quizzes, (40%)","message_from_instructor":"As you study biomedical engineering, you will find that many biomedical devices and instruments, and sciences behind life phenomena are related to electromagnetism. Electromagnetism is based on a very beautiful theory described by a set of four fundamental equations, known as Maxwell's equations. Therefore, whenever you encounter any complex electromagnetic problems, you can get back to a simple model with the fundamental equations. Conversely, to really understand what the equations mean, you need to have some mathematical skills such as vector calculus and to capture a clear image for the physics. I hope you will learn the fundamentals in this course and gain the ability to analyze bio-physical phenomena, and apply your knowledge for solving future practical problems in biomedical engineering.","course_keywords":"Maxwell's equations, vector calculus, static electromagnetism","office_hours":"Tuesday 3pm - 5pm Room 513, Bldg. 4, Koganei Campus","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/13/2023 5:23:18 PM","name":{"id":304,"ja":"線形代数学Ⅰ","en":"Linear Algebra Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":277,"ja":"古谷 哲也","en":"FURUYA Tetsuya"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":null,"office":"","day_period":"Thu.3～4","references":""}}
