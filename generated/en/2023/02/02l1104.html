As “a science and liberal arts course” of “the global liberal arts group”, this lecture aims to acquire the basic law of thermodynamics, to be able to understand life phenomena and living things from thermodynamic point of view.\n\n<Outline> Lectures are conducted based on a textbook from \"unit\" which is the foundation of science, to the first and second laws of thermodynamics, finally Gibbs energy. In each lesson, I will conduct an exercise to deepen the understanding of the lesson content of that class, so I would like you to use it for review. I am specifying an English textbook, so I would like you to prepare and take classes and learn technical terms in both English and Japanese.","expected_learning":"Students who successfully complete this course will able to:\n1) Understand the concepts such as heat, work, internal energy, and enthalpy and the first law of thermodynamics correctly.\n2) Explain the energy conversion in life using thermodynamics.\n3) Understand the concepts such as entropy and Gibbs energy and assess the spontaneity of a biological process.\n\nThis subject corresponds to the viewpoint A of the diploma policy.\n","course_schedule":"Week 1: Fundamental 1 of physical chemistry (Fundamentals in the text book)\nUnderstanding units, state, force, energy, and pressure\nWeek 2: Fundamental 2 of physical chemistry (Fundamentals in the text book)\nUnderstanding temperature, equations of state, and the Maxwell distribution\nof speeds\nWeek 3: The first law of thermodynamics 1 (Chapter 1)\nUnderstanding the energy conversion and the concepts of thermodynamics such\nas systems, surroundings, work, and heat\nWeek 4: The first law of thermodynamics 2 (Chapter 1)\nUnderstanding the energy conversion in living organisms, reversible\nprocesses, and expansion work\nWeek 5: The first law of thermodynamics 3 (Chapter 1)\nUnderstanding heat capacity and internal energy and learning the first law of\nthermodynamics\nWeek 6: The first law of thermodynamics 4 (Chapter 1)\nUnderstanding enthalpy and the enthalpy change of phase transition\nWeek 7: The first law of thermodynamics 5 (Chapter 1)\nUnderstanding the bond enthalpy, thermodynamical properties of fuels, and\nstandard enthalpies of formation\nWeek 8: Measurement of heat (Chapter 1 and supplementary materials)\nUnderstanding differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), isothermal titration\n　　　　calorimetry (ITC), protein interaction\nWeek 9: Summary of the first law of thermodynamics\nMidterm examination\nWeek 10: The second law of thermodynamics 1 (Chapter 2)\nUnderstanding entropy, entropy change, and absolute entropies\nWeek 11: The second law of thermodynamics 2 (Chapter 2)\nUnderstanding standard reaction entropy and spontaneity of chemical\nreactions\nWeek 12: The second law of thermodynamics 3 (Chapter 2)\nUnderstanding Gibbs energy and relation between Gibbs energy and\nspontaneity\nWeek 13: The second law of thermodynamics 4 (Chapter 2)\nUnderstanding the Gibbs energy of assembly of proteins and biological\nmembranes\nWeek 14: The second law of thermodynamics 5 (Chapter 2)\nUnderstanding the relationship between nonexpansion work and Gibbs free energy\nWeek 15: Summary of the second law of thermodynamics and Gibbs energy\n　　　　 Final examination\n","prerequisites":"Students entering this class are assumed to have had “Basic physics” and “Basic chemistry”.
