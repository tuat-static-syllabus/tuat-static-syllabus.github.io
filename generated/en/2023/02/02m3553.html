This is because all particles have characteristics also as waves. In this class, I will show that this character as a wave.\n\nClass code: wjemz7u","expected_learning":"The minimum target is to understand that all particles have characteristic also as waves.\nIt is required to explain that particles localized in a small area can only discrete energies.\n","course_schedule":"1. Is the light particle or wave?\n2. Double characteristic of light (wave and particle) blackbody radiation photoelectron effects\n3. Discovery of electron mass and charge\n4. Atomic energy structure (time for calculation by students)\n5. Idea of matter wave electron interferometry\n6. Derivation of Schroedinger equation\n7. Solution of Schroedinger equation with the well type potential (time for calculation by students)\n8. Uncertainty principle\n9. Eigen function of angular momentum and the energy state of an electron in a hydrogen atom\n10. Electron spin and Dirac equation\n11. Quantum effect in the heat capacity (why heat capacity depends on the material?)\n12. Atomic clock given by quantum effects\n13. Extreme quantum effect Bose condensation + Fermi degeneracy\n14. Mysteries in modern physics\n15. Summaries\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specialized by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Print is distributed at the lecture\nPower Point files are also distributed.","assessment":"Online exams 100 %\nNo additional point is given based on attendance alone.","message_from_instructor":"I know that quantum mechanics is not familiar for human life, and difficult to understand at first.
