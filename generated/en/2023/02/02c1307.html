This course mainly covers classical wet analysis based on chemical reactions. Although modern analysis is dependent mainly on physicochemical instruments, the basis of the analysis is supported by the classical chemical analysis. First, students will learn how to quantitatively treat with various chemical equilibria in aqueous solutions, and subsequently their applications to volumetric and gravimetric analysis, followed by introductory lectures on separation methods used in chemical analysis such as ion exchange and solvent extraction. This analytical chemistry course provides students with the chemical foundation toward more specialized chemistry courses such as inorganic chemistry and physical chemistry. As for instrumental analysis, students will learn in the courses, Instrumental Analysis I and Instrumental Analysis II.\n\nFundamentally this lecture proceeds according to the textbook in Japanese shown below, excluding Chpts. 7 - 9 concerning instrumental analysis. Problems for self-study as well as English terms on elements and chemical compounds will be distributed as handouts, and the answers are checked on the blackboard as exercises in the beginning of several lectures. The questions in the exams will be given partly in English but in Japanese for the rest.\n\nClass code: 253xs2h","expected_learning":"The standard of the course is to understand chemical equilibria in solution and basis of chemical analysis based on the chemical equilibria.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"The course schedule will be as follows:\n\nWeek 1: Introduction, What is analytical chemistry, Notation of concentration\nWeek 2: Measurements and errors, Significant figure, Volumetric analysis (concept of acid/base)\nWeek 3: Volumetric analysis (acid-base dissociation, chemical equilibria in solution)\nWeek 4: Volumetric analysis (acid-base titration)\nWeek 5: Volumetric analysis (redox reaction, Nernst equation)\nWeek 6: Volumetric analysis (redox titration)\nWeek 7: Volumetric analysis (coordination compound, chelate reaction)\nWeek 8: Midterm summary\nWeek 9: Volumetric analysis (precipitation titration)\nWeek 10: Gravimetric analysis (precipitate formation)\nWeek 11: Gravimetric analysis (thermogravimetry, operation in gravimetric analysis)\nWeek 12: Separation, Solvent extraction\nWeek 13: Solid-phase extraction, Ion-exchange separation\nWeek 14: Basic chromatography\nWeek 15: Term-end summary\nTerm-end exam","prerequisites":"Students entering this class are assumed to have learned Chemistry in Japanese high school curriculum or its equivalent. Otherwise, there will be difficulty in understanding part of the contents in this course. In this case it is strongly recommended to study the relevant field by yourself, especially chemical and ionization equilibria, until May.\n\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and review the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the textbook, the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"K.

But, more quantitative treatments are required to understand the chemistry behind the analytical chemistry, and you might find more difficulty. Reviews and exercises are important for this lecture.","course_keywords":"chemical analysis, quantitative analysis, volumetric analysis, gravimetric analysis, separation","office_hours":"Prof. Kenji OGINO (BASE building: 323) Anytime","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/4/2023 1:37:17 PM","name":{"id":124,"ja":"分析科学","en":"Analytical Science"},"instructor":{"id":303,"ja":"劉 念麟","en":""},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Institute of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Thu.2","references":"Any textbooks or exercise books concerning analytical chemistry for university courses will be useful, but those mainly concerning instrumental analysis should be avoided."}}
