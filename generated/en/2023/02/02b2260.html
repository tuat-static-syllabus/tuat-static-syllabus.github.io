In addition, you can learn about the latest biology and related topics and findings.\n","expected_learning":"Biology is a fundamental and indispensable science for engineers and researchers in various fields. The aim of this series is that students in non-biological courses will become able to feel familiar with biology and to imagine the real biological systems by overviewing bio-science.","course_schedule":"1st class.

Substantial participation to the class is highly welcomed.","texts_and_materials":"Not specified.","assessment":"(1) Examination at the end of semester, (2) a few reports, and (3) short quizzes for every classes. The weight of evaluation of (1)/(2)/(3) is approximately 2/1/1.","message_from_instructor":"Biology is an essential subject for understanding complex life phenomena.Some people imagine that the significance of the life has already be known, so that artificial lives using cloning technologies combined with AI technologies are ready for real. However, I am sure that human wisdom to the life still remains at the surface into its significance of wonderful and elaborate mechanisms.\nThe methods of pioneering works of forerunners in biology have increasingly been too subdivided in recent years, and we are missing the whole body nature. New trial understanding of the life as a dissipating but cooperative systems is on the way. I wish that you shall be the one to open the new horizon of paradigms in the bio- and life-science.","course_keywords":"Genetics, Genomes, Respiration, Photo-synthesis, Molecular biology, Systems biology, Quantum life science.","office_hours":"Make appointment by Email. tabata-bsr[at]go.tuat.ac.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/28/2023 3:05:12 PM","name":{"id":323,"ja":"地域生態システム学Ⅲ","en":"Ecoregion Science III"},"instructor":{"id":289,"ja":"仲井 まどか","en":"NAKAI Madoka"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":null,"office":"","day_period":"Wed.2","references":"Not specified.
