These characteristics are Voltage, Current, Impedance, Frequency and Equiliberium conditions of the circuit.\n1. Transformation (including Ideal Transformer)\n2. Loop Equation (Loop Current method), Node Equation (Node Voltage method)\n3. Basic theorem in circuit analysis such as, Inverse Theorem, Equiliberium Power Sources, Maximum Power Transmission Theorem\n4. 2-Ports parameters, Cascading connction, Parallel connection, different operation of 2-Ports circuits","expected_learning":"In this lecture, the students will be able to learn about many Alternative Circuits theory and application. Also, the students will have the ability of calculating and analyzing many AC circuits. In order to have these kinds of ability, the students should solve many problems related to the subject of this course, not only during the lecture but also outside the lecture.","course_schedule":"The followings are the contents of the course (these contents might be changed based on the flow of the classes).\n\n1st Class: guidance of the entire course\n\n\nChapter 7: Transformer\n　In this chapter we will study about the basic equation, the characteristics and the features of the transformer. Transformers with single, two or more coils, such as a tight coupling transformer and an ideal transformer, are used for a circuit. We also study about understanding the meaning of mutual-inductance, M, as well.\n\n2nd Class: 2-winding transformer, control source\n3rd Class: Auto-transformer, ideal transformer\n4th Class: Multi-transformer\n\nChapter 8: Circuit Equation\nIn this chapter we study about the foundations of how to form equations for calculating voltage and current in a circuit. For this sake we use the application of Kirchhoff's law, a loop circuit current method, and a node voltage method.\nAs circuits have R, C, L, and M, then we should understand well that voltage and current are governed by them.\n\n5th Class: Loop Equation\n6th Class: Nodal Equation\n7th Class: Solution of simultaneous linear equations\n\n* Mid-term test will be held after finishing the Chapters 7 and 8.\n\nChapter 9: Theorem and Characteristics for Deeply Understanding of Circuits\nIn this chapter, for deeply understanding the circuits, we study about many theorem such as a Reverse Theorem, Thevenin's Theorem, Norton's Theorem, Compensation Theorem, and the Law of Maximum Power Transmission, etc.\n\n8th Class: Reverse Theorem, Duality, Reverse Circuit\n9th Class: Equivalent Power Supply and Compensation Theorem\n10th Class: Maximum Power Transmission Theorem\n\nChapter 10: 2-Ports Network Parameters\nIn this chapter we learn about how to express the relation of voltage and current of 2-ports networks by 6 different matrices such as Z, Y, g, h, F, Fi. These 2-Port Networks are widely used in circuit analysis.\nAlso, we study about Input/Output impedance, transmission quantity, repetitive parameter, etc. Moreover, we study about the fundamental characteristic which is needed when using this kind of network.\n\n11th Class: Six different parameters of 2-Ports network.\n\n12th Class: Mutual conversion of parameters in 2-Ports network.\n13th Class: Cascade connection and parallel connection of 2-Ports networks.\n14th Class: Operations of 2-Ports network\n15th Class: Final examination","prerequisites":"Condition for taking this course\nUnderstanding of Fundamental Circuit Theory is required for understanding this course.","texts_and_materials":"Textbook\nFundamental of Circuit Theory, IEEJ Textbook for University Courses, Published by IEEJ, 1999 (17 Edition), Aurthur: Ken Yanagisawa\nIn this course we study from Chapter 7 to Chapter 10.","assessment":"【Important, Due to Corona Virus Situation】　In case we had the entire classes of this course as ONLINE Lecture】\nThe grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, report, and online tests. Standard study time set by our university is required to get the grade.\n\nThe rate of evaluation is as follows:\n\nquizzes and assignment test（3 times): 30 points\nIntermediate online test: 30 points\nFinal online test: 40 points\nTotal points: 100 points\nPassing Score: 60 points and above\nGrade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.","message_from_instructor":"Circuit Theory is one of the fundamental course and is important though necessary for electrical and electronic students.
