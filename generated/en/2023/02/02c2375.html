It is essential to solve the problems by yourself for deep understanding of inorganic and analytical chemistries. In this course, therefore, you will be required to answer the questions. Exams will be given every week according to the course schedule announced in the course guidance. What each exam covers will also be given in the schedule. The questions in the exam will be assigned from the text for each chapter and/or will be similar to those found in the text. The course formats consist of 1) exams for the corresponding chapters, and 2) explanation of how to solve the problems.","expected_learning":"The objective of this course is to gain a solid understanding of basic inorganic and analytical chemistries by solving problems. You will be able to explain various phenomena regarding inorganic and analytical chemistries based on your acquired knowledge.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1 Course Guidance\nWeek 2 Analytical Chemistry: Solution concentration, equilibrium in solution\nWeek 3 Analytical Chemistry: Acid-base titration\nWeek 4 Analytical Chemistry: Redox titration, chelate reaction, precipitation titration\nWeek 5 Analytical Chemistry: Gravimetric analysis, separation\nWeek 6 Review of Analytical Chemistry\nMidterm examination\nWeek 7 Inorganic Chemistry I: Atomic structure (Bohr model, quantization, wave function)\nWeek 8 Inorganic Chemistry I: Molecular structure (localized binding approximation and basis of molecular orbital theory)\nWeek 9 Inorganic Chemistry I: Ionic solids (crystal lattice and lattice energy), symmetry of molecules and crystals\nWeek 10 Inorganic Chemistry II: Acids and bases, oxidation and reduction, redox\nWeek 11 Inorganic Chemistry II: Periodic properties of the elements, main group elements\nWeek 12 Inorganic Chemistry III: Coordination compounds (nomenclature)\nWeek 13 Inorganic Chemistry III: Coordination compounds (isomer, stepwise and overall formation constants)\nWeek 14 Inorganic Chemistry III: d orbital splitting, crystal field stabilization energy, spin state, magnetism\nWeek 15 Review of Inorganic Chemistry I, II and III\nTerm-end examination","prerequisites":"In the exercise, what each exam covers will be given in the schedule. For that reason, it is necessary to read the corresponding part of the text and to prepare such as solving the chapter problem (12 hours).\nAfter completion of the class, each person checks the answer, the wrong part is reconfirmed against the text, the corresponding answers, and the commentary on the lecture etc. (3 hours).\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to perform the above task using the textbook and the references specified below.\nIn completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the university.","texts_and_materials":"Original textbook ed. by instructors","assessment":"Your grade will be determined largely by a total score of exam points in principle(100%). A degree of participation in class may be considered.\nYou are expected to attend the course guidance and all exam sessions to pass the course.\n\nPast grade distribution\n2021 S(18%), A(23%), B(39%), C(9%), D(11%)","message_from_instructor":"The scope of each exam will be announced in the course guidance. The students should prepare for the exams. It is essential for understanding inorganic and analytical chemistries to think for yourself.","course_keywords":"Inorganic Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis","office_hours":"Respond as needed.
