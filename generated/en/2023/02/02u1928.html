In this course, we will learn about differentiation and integration of multivariable functions, such as partial differentiations, criteria of local maxima and minima, double and triple integrations, volumes of solids, line integrations and series. Various computations will be practiced with drawing diagrams.\n\nThis course is taught by a part-time lecturer. Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiation and integration of two, or multivariable functions, and\n(2) to be capable of performing practical computations.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"week1: Functions of two variables\nweek2: Partial derivatives, Total derivatives\nweek3: Differentiation of composite functions\nweek4: Taylor's theorem\nweek5: Local maxima and minima of functions of two variables\nweek6: Implicit functions\nweek7: Midterm examination\nweek8: Double integrals\nweek9: Changes of variables, Triple integrals\nweek10: Volumes, Surface areas\nweek11: Gamma function, Beta function\nweek12: Line integrals, Green's theorem\nweek13: Series\nweek14: Power series\nweek15: Final examination","prerequisites":"It is categorized into technology speciality courses. 　\nKnowledge of the course of Calculus I and Exercise will be used in the lecture.\nIn addition to 60 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the university and using the lecture notes.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Exercises (20％), Midterm examination (40％)，Final examination (40％)，","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Multivariable function, Partial derivative, Double integral, Power series","office_hours":"The time before or after lectures","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/25/2023 3:36:14 PM","name":{"id":268,"ja":"住環境構造学","en":"Housing Structure"},"instructor":{"id":411,"ja":"新井 克彦, 渡辺 元","en":"ARAI Katsuhiko, WATANABE Gen"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Scleroprotein and Leather Research Institute","office":"","day_period":"undefined.6","references":"Miyake, Toshitsune, “Nyumon Bibunsekibun”, Baifukan"}}
