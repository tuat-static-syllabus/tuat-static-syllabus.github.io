We who live in the modern world are unconsciously bound to the past and live under its restrictions. Itis only by learning about the past and relativizing the current reality, the current environment, and the current system that we will be able to think freely about the future. In this class, with \"relativization\" as the keyword, we would like to think together with you about the perspectives, awareness, and perceptions that relativize the present through the process of looking on the history.\n　\nThe theme of this class is \"Jinja”,Shinto shrines. There is a deep-rooted belief in general society that shrines have always conveyed the ancient layers of Japan since ancient times, and many people have an image of \"Japan\" based on this belief. I would like to look as concretely as possible at the Japanese society we live in and its history, which can be seen when we relativize this assumption.","expected_learning":"(1) To understand how to look at history as a liberal arts discipline and how to think about it\n(2) To understand the historical and traditional elements of Japanese society and how they were formed.\n(3) To understand the historical characteristics and diversity of shrines in Japanese society\n\nCompentency Development:\nAutonomy, Intercultural Understanding, Global Awareness, Ability to Explore Knowledge, Academic Ethics","course_schedule":"01.
