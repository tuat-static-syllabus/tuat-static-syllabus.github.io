The objective of this lecture is to acquire basic knowledge and skills in programming using C language which is one of the most widely used programming languages.\n\n[Outline] In this lecture, we aim to acquire attitudes to write good programs and explanation that are easy to understand for readers, easy to modify and extend based on familiar themes. Topics to cover include I/O, assignment, repetition, condition , array, function, pointer, numerical calculation, data structure, etc. Students are expected to understand these topics but also to obtain similar results more efficiently or more accurately in order to acquire knowledge and skills necessary to learn other subjects. This lecture does not explain exhaustively the C language grammar.\n\nThis class is offered by a lecturer who has a practical experience in industry regarding software development and shows examples in a company.","expected_learning":"1. Understand the basic idea of ??programming in C language for a given task.\n2. Learn features necessary for programming such as control structures, arrays, functions, pointers, struct.\n3. Learn variable scope and the difference of function arguments between passed by value and passed by pointer.\n4. Learn basic file operations.\n5. Learn the basic idea for accurate numerical calculation.\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"1. Introduction\nTopics: introduction to computer and programming\n2.

Maze solving\nTopics: recurrence relation and recursive programs\nRelated C features: recursive functions","prerequisites":"It is a required subject, and related closely to \"Computer programming I: exercises,\" \"Computer programming II,\" and \"Computer programming II: exercises.\" Because this subject does not include exercises, students should fully work on exercises in \"Computer programming I: exercises\" held in the same period. In addition to 30 hours of this course, prepare and review for the same hours using the exercises indicated at the end of each chapter of the textbook.","texts_and_materials":"The textbook \"Computer programming I\" (written in Japanese) is used.","assessment":"The mid-term and the final examinations 100%","message_from_instructor":"Students should always try creating programs as concise as possible and easy to understand. Even if one solution or program is found, always consider that further improvement is possible. In addition, consider computational complexity so that created programs have sufficient performance for larger size of data.\n","course_keywords":"programming, program, C language","office_hours":"Usually answer questions after the class.
