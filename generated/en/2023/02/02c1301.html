In addition, the opportunity to experience cutting-edge research conducted in the laboratories of the Department of Applied Chemistry and to imagine oneself as a researcher in the future will motivate students to study in this department. For this reason, we will incorporate laboratory visits in small groups that incorporate elements of active learning.\n\n[Summary] This course consists of an explanation of the collection of information necessary for self-study and specialized study, an introduction to the research content of each laboratory in the Department of Applied Chemistry, and a laboratory tour conducted in small groups. The introduction to the research content is given in rotation by the faculty members who lead the laboratories, and together with the opportunity to visit the laboratories, this course serves as an introduction to applied chemistry.\n\nClass code (for guidance): shnh3in","expected_learning":"General Discussion: Students will be able to acquire a foundation for self-study and professional learning at the university, such as information collection.\n\nIntroduction to Laboratory Research: Students will be able to understand the latest research being conducted in each laboratory and be able to discuss future developments, possibilities, and applications of the research. Understand the relationship between research content and courses within the department.\n\nLaboratory tours: Students are interested in the research environment in which the research they heard about in the research introduction is conducted, and can understand it through the tours.\n\nDiploma Policy Perspective of the Department: Please refer to the curriculum map in the course guide.","course_schedule":"1st to 6th classes: Guidance and general discussion of applied chemistry. In addition to information collection-related explanations necessary for self-study and professional study, a general discussion will be held on the basis of the study.\n\n7th to 9th, 12th and 13th classes: Introduction of laboratory research: Four faculty members per session will introduce the latest research being conducted in their laboratories. The content of these studies will be explained and how they relate to the courses offered by the department.\n\n10th, 11th, 14th and 15th classes: Laboratory tours. Students visit the laboratory to learn how the research they heard about in the research introduction is conducted and in what kind of research environment. Students will be divided into 10 groups, and the program will be conducted in small groups. Students will be divided into 10 groups, and the program will be conducted in a small number of students.\n","prerequisites":"It is classified as a basic subject subject and is a required subject.\nIn addition to the lesson time, refer to the instructed materials, etc., and conduct preparations, reviews and surveys in accordance with the standard time of the University.","texts_and_materials":"Texts and materials will be announced by each instructor.","assessment":"The evaluation will be made comprehensively based on the grades given in the lectures and laboratory visits.
