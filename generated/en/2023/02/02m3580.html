Among them, focusing on the assembly process, we learn about the latest trends regarding the mechanism as hardware for efficient production, automation, computer assistance using IT and IoT.\n\nIn general manufacturing industries such as automobile industry and aircraft industry, work is proceeding in the process of product development, production preparation, manufacturing. In this lecture, the production process and mechanism of basic industrial products, automation in production process and IT utilization will be presented. Next, CAD / CAM, which is the key to automation / IT utilization will be introduced. The history and the future of Japanese industrial companies in the manufacturing system will be talked, and also international trends will be touched.","expected_learning":"Students need to be able to explain the flow and mechanism of work related to manufacturing process as a mechanical engineer. Automation and efficiency improvement by computer aid. Students also can understand the outline of internal processing of CAD / CAM system and can utilize it for actual operation.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"1. Production system adding value to goods\nAfter discussing what added value is, the mechanism and type of various production systems will be overviewed.\n2. Manufacturing processes of the products around us\nStudents will present the contents that each studied about the process of making real products such as LCD panel, wrist watch, pet bottle, bolt, mobile phone etc.\n3. Various types of manufacturing system 1\nExplain about assembly type and process type. multi-product small volume production, small variety large quantity production, flow shop type production and job shop type production.\n4. Various types of manufacturing system 2\nLine production and cell production, push type and pull type, “Kanban” will be explained.\n5. Automation and IT Utilization 1\nExplain QCD (quality, cost, delivery), management in manufacturing, and describe the information processing system (production control, CAD / CAM / CAE / CAT, FMS).\n6.
