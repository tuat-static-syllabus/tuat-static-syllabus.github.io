However, even if the development method changes, the requirements for design procedures and drawings do not change. Rather, as engineers play an active role globally, the demand for information contained in drawings is becoming stricter.\nThe purpose of this course is to learn the basics of design through practical training such as handwritten drafting and design procedures, and to understand \"manufacturing\". The flow of the lecture is to learn the basics of drafting based on textbooks and materials created by the instructor, and then practice from design specification determination to drawing creation.","expected_learning":"You will be able to understand the information required for drawings and be able to perform basic development according to the theme.","course_schedule":"1st　Necessity of drafting, Basics of drawing (~ auxiliary drawing), Exercises drawing\n2nd　Drawing basics (dimensions ~ normal tolerances), Exercises drawing\n3rd　Drawing basics (surface texture ~ surface treatment), Exercises drawing\n4th　Development flow, Spring design, Seal design, Exercise (spring design, seal design)\n5th　Shaft design, Bearing design, Exercises drawing\n6th　Gear design, Exercise (gear design)\n7th　Exercises (Steering wheel, Gears, 3D view → Plan view, Plan view → 3D view)\n8th　Explanation of Drawing exercises\nReducer design challenges, (concept design, create design specification)\n9th　Reducer design challenges (concept drawing, calculate gear specification, calculate bearing selection and life)\n10th Reducer design challenges (concept drawing, calculate gear specification, calculate bearing selection and life)\n11th　Reducer design challenges (plan drawing)\n12th　Reducer design challenges (plan drawing)\n13th　Reducer design challenges (plan drawing and parts drawing)\n14th　Reducer design challenges (parts drawing)\n15th　Summary of design challenges (design specification, concept drawing, plan drawing, parts drawing)","prerequisites":"・You must have a desk, etc. that can draw A3 size drawings in an environment other than the university drafting room (home, etc.).\n・You must have internet facilities that allow you to take classes online.\n","texts_and_materials":"・ Text: \"Useful Mechanical Drafting\" edited by Hirotsugu Hayashi (Asakura Shoten, in Japanese)\n(林洋次編著　『役に立つ機械製図』　（朝倉書店）)\n・ Handouts created by the instructor\n・ Drafting tools(pencil H & HB, set square, compass, drafting tape, etc.), writing utensils, notebooks, laptop or tablet for viewing (smartphone is acceptable), calculators (6th and later)\n","assessment":"・Exercises and design assignments will be evaluated by submitting them.\n・However, if you draw a drawing without using a drafting tool, you will be deducted.\n・Attendance of 4/5 or more is a prerequisite. (Basically all lectures attended)\n・If you are absent due to poor physical condition, please submit the prescribed documents.","message_from_instructor":"I will explain the practical design procedure and drawing while introducing the development work that I have practiced in the company.
