In particular, we will learn about basic properties and computation of a basis and the dimension of a vector space, the image and kernel of a linear map. We also learn about the concepts and methods of eigen values and eigen spaces, diagonalization, and metric spaces, aiming at better understanding of linear algebra.\n\nThis course is taught by a part-time lecturer. Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is:\n1) to understand basic notions of vector spaces, linear maps, linear independence and bases\n2) capable to calculate (bases of) the image and kernel of a linear map given by a matrix\n3) capable to calculate the representation matrix of a linear map with respect to given bases\n4) capable to calculate the eigen values and eigen spaces of a square matrix and determine whether it is diagonalizable\n5) capable to ortho-normalize a given basis of a metric space\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps\n","course_schedule":"1.
