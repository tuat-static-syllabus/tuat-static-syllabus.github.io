Class-code will be shown prior to opening of 3rd semester.\nStudents should bring in the lecture room L0035 with their own personal notebook PC.\n\nThe details of the lectures are shown in the GoogleClassroom.\nThrough the Classroom, the reference materials will be provided. Submission of the requested reports are also to be made through it as well.\n\nThe outline of the lectures is as follows.\nEngineers graduated from the department of Biomedical Engineering shall commit, based on their academic background of physical engineering, electronics and electric engineering, and mechanical engineering, to develop frontier medical and diagnosis technologies, where the theoretical foundation of the physics of microscopic particles and materials, namely Quantum Mechanics, is indispensable. It is because the technologies in this field are based on the understanding of the chemical, dynamic, and electronic transition-behaviors of microscopic matters, such as bio-molecules and cells.\nQuantum Mechanics is one of the theories in physics. Based on the particle/wave duality and uncertainty lying beneath the material properties, the Quantum Mechanics explains microscopic physical phenomena, which are difficult to understand in the framework of the classical theories.\nThe present series of lecture aims you to become able to understand the above mentioned behaviors through solving the fundamental equation in quantum mechanics, i.e., the Schrodinger equation, for typical and simple cases of microscopic problems in one- through three-dimensional systems.","expected_learning":"Students are expected\n1) to became able to describe the basics of quantum mechanics, such as the meaning of a wave function.\n2) to become able to solve simple one-dimensional problems of the Schrodinger equation and then explain the basic properties of quantum mechanics.\nand\n3) to become able to solve simple three-dimensional problems of the Schrodinger equation and then explain the basic properties of quantum mechanics.\nCorresponding criteria are shown in the Diploma Policy of the department of Biomedical Engineering. See also the corresponding Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Weeks 1,2\nThe Schrodinger equation:\nwave functions, Born's interpretation, expectation values, operators, Ehrenfest's theorem\n\nWeeks 3-6\nOne-dimensional problems; Reflection and transmission:\nPotential barrier, potential step, tunnel effect\nHarmonic oscillator\n\nWeek 7\nMid-term test\n\nWeeks 8, 9\nOne-dimensional problems; Bound states:\nSquare-well potential, harmonic oscillator\n\nWeeks 10-14\nExpansion of the idea of mechanical system into the three dimension\nThe method to derive the spherical harmonics and their physical meaning\nThe method to derive the radial wave functions and their physical meaning\nConclusions\n\nWeek 15\nTerm-end examination","prerequisites":"Since the Quantum Mechanics is the mechanical theory for microscopic particle having duality property, which stands by itself. However, is desirable that students have studied the series lectures the Classical Mechanics, the Electromagnetism, and the Physics of Wave (not necessary to have completed the credits of those courses).\nStudents are recommended to prepare for and revise the lecture, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below. For those self-organized studies, text and built-in homework are prepared as much as possible.","texts_and_materials":"Not specified.\nEvery typical textbook of quantum mechanics describes the theory in this course of lecture.","assessment":"Examinations, term-end exam. 50%, Homework 50%.","message_from_instructor":"The behaviors of bio-molecules and bio-cells are the dynamics of microscopic systems, so that, for example, it is completely difficult to analyze the biological functions of, say, “ion channels” without the help of Quantum Mechanics. The medical and diagnosis technologies, such as laser and ion-beam therapies, CT radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are based on the advanced detection for the dynamics and state-transition of microscopic particles. So the engineers shall be asked to have theoretical basis how the microscopic properties are expressed. As in the cases of other theories, the appearance of Quantum Mechanics is mathematical and difficult. However, unlike scientific fictions or paranormal phenomena, the behaviors of microscopic particles and materials are physically understandable, surprisingly, so that you are sure to come to the goal. I promise the theoretical basis of Quantum Mechanics shall expand your engineer’s field significantly.","course_keywords":"Wave functions, Schrodinger equation, well-like potentials, harmonic oscillator, tunneling effect, operators, hydrogenic atoms, angular momenta, spin","office_hours":"Please contact by email beforehand.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/5/2023 4:31:13 PM","name":{"id":289,"ja":"中国語ステップアップ","en":"Intermediate Chinese"},"instructor":{"id":288,"ja":"笠原 博幸","en":"KASAHARA Hiroyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Institute of Global Innovation Research","office":"","day_period":"Thu.2","references":"0) B.
