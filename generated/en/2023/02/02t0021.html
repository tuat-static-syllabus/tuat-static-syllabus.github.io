On the other hand, declining birthrate and aging working population would undoubtedly make productivity and potential growth less vitalized but also bring about a crucial impact on the sustainability of the social security system. It is not that easy to predict where our socio-economic system goes from here.\n\nThis course aims to provide opportunities to learn basic economic theory for students who are interested in revealing how economics contributes to the real world. Economics will help us describe hypothetical scenarios regarding our socio-economy in the future. Also reading classical works by giants in the history, we will try to find out social matters which might seem to be resolved by economics.","expected_learning":"(1) Distinguish microeconomy from macroeconomy based on causalities of economic events.\n(2) Apply basic analytical tools of economics to actual issues for generally acceptable resolutions.\n(3) Discover effective causation upon which our socio-economic system would depend in the future.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Orientation --- (i) Mission in the Class, (ii) Explanation of Grading\nWeek 2: Elementary Approach to Economics --- (i) Philosophy, (ii) Target\nWeek 3: Learning from Classics (1) --- Fundamental Issues of the Socio-Economic System\nWeek 4: Basic Method for Analysis (1) --- (i) Microeconomics, (ii) Macroeconomics\nWeek 5: Basic Method for Analysis (2) --- (i) Consumer Theory, (ii) National Income Theory\nWeek 6: Basic Method for Analysis (3) --- (i) Producer Theory, (ii) Multiplier Theory\nWeek 7: Recitation of Week 1 to 6 (Assignment 1)\nWeek 8: Advanced Method for Analysis (1) --- Market Equilibrium Theory\nWeek 9: Advanced Method for Analysis (2) --- Aggregate Demand - Aggregate Supply Theory\nWeek 10: Advanced Method for Analysis (3) --- Input-Output Analysis\nWeek 11: Learning from Classics (2) --- Public Goods\nWeek 12: Future Perspective (1) --- Impact of Advanced Science and Technology\nWeek 13: Future Perspective (2) --- Globalization and Risk Management\nWeek 14: Recitation of Week 8 to 13 (Assignment 2)\nWeek 15: Wrap-up","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours in classes and time required for completing assignments, students are recommended to prepare for and review the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University [TUAT] and using the lecture handouts as well as the references.","texts_and_materials":"Joseph E.
