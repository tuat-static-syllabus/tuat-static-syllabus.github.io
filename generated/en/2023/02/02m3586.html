Furthermore, its machining or assembly can be planned and evaluated on the basis of 3D model. Therefore, it is indispensable to use 3D CAD (Computer Aided Design) through design and production of modern mechanical systems. In this exercises, the goal is to acquire the operation method of 3D model. In the first half, students create and assemble 3D model of parts of stirling engine and realize the motion simulation on computer. In the latter half, students address free drawing of mechanical system.\nGoogle Classroom : dajnqdx","expected_learning":"(1) Modeling and assembly of 3D mechanical parts, and motion simulation of mechanical system\n(2) Understanding of representation method and data structure of 3D CAD, and modification of given 3D model\n(3) 3D model creation and drawing from 2D drawing\n(4) Acquisition of basic operation method of 3D CAD, usage of online help for unclear operation by oneself\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1 : Guidance and online tutorials\nWeek 2-3 : Online tutorials and install CAD on applicant’s laptop\nWeek 4-6 : Modeling of parts of stirling engine\nWeek 7-8 : Assembly and motion simulation of stirling engine\nWeek 9 : Review of lessons and Midterm examination\nWeek 10-14 : Free drawing\nWeek 15 : Presentation of free drawing\nStudents should take online tutorials and assignments by 3D CAD.","prerequisites":"It is expected that students have already acquired a fundamental knowledge of “Mechanical drawing” and ”Mechanical systems”.\nStudents are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Prints are distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"Everytime quiz : 30%, ，Midterm exam : 30%, Free drawing : 40%","message_from_instructor":"It is generally desirable to practice software such as 3D CAD by oneself.
