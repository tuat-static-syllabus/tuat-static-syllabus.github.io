Objective\nIn this lecture, we aim to acquire the ability to understand the electrical properties (electronic properties) of metals, insulators and semiconductors that make up electric / electronic circuits. Furthermore, based on these basic electrical properties, we can acquire the basis for creating new electronic devices etc. in the future graduation research etc.\n\nb. Overview\nElectronic devices supporting IT technologies such as IC and LSI operate by mainly using semiconductors and using the electrical characteristics of metals and insulators. Therefore, in this lecture, we explain that these electrical properties and properties related to light can be explained unified by electron arrangement, distribution and behavior in solid.\n","expected_learning":"(1) I understand electron energy compared with mechanical energy.\n(2) Explain the electric conduction mechanism in the solid.\n(3) I understand the meaning that brings about the difference in electrical conductivity between metals, semiconductors and insulators.\n(4) I understand the mechanism of electric conduction of various semiconductors.\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1st Introduction: visualization of electricity that imagines electricity\n2nd Understanding of electron movement\n3rd Comparison of potential energy and mechanical potential energy for electrons (1)\n4th Comparison of potential energy and mechanical potential energy for electrons (2)\n5th Electric conduction in solid ~ formation of energy band ~\n6th Why semiconductors are \"semi-conductors\"?\n7th Concept of carrier generation in semiconductors ~ Free electron and hole ~\n8th What is impurity in semiconductor?\n9th Concept of carrier generation for intrinsic, n-type and p-type semiconductors\n10th Formula of Carrier Conduction in Solid Crystal\n11th Teaching of electromagnetism Poisson equation\n12th PN junction diode and its electrical characteristics\n13th Metal-semiconductor contact\n14th Bipolar transistor and its electrical characteristics\n15th Final exams","prerequisites":"Students are expected to have the standard amount of time to prepare for and review the lecture as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Instructed in the first lecture.\n","assessment":"Evaluating by Final exams.\n","message_from_instructor":"As this lecture starts from the basic contents learned from high school physics, it becomes suddenly difficult when it is done several times, so be sure to ask questions and ask them to understand each time a little.\n","course_keywords":"Metal, semiconductor, insulator, electrical properties, crystal structures","office_hours":"Office Hour: Every Monday 13:00-15:00 Place: 5-201","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"6/7/2023 1:32:17 PM","name":{"id":267,"ja":"紙パルプ科学","en":"Pulp and Paper Science and Technology"},"instructor":{"id":247,"ja":"増田 耕一","en":"MASUDA Kohichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Thu.2","references":"Ohba et al .: The Institute of Electrical Engineers, University Lecture \"Basic of Electronic Physics\" edited by the Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan, (in JAPANESE)\nSato and Koshida: \"Applied Electronic Physical Properties Engineering\" Listen to the explanation of the first class, such as Corona Inc.
