In this course, we will learn the differentiations and the integrations of various functions of one variable and their properties. We will practice advanced computations in this course rather than in high schools.\n\nThis course is taught by a part-time lecturer. Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiations and the integrations of various functions, such as polynomials, rational and irrational functions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions,\n(2) to understand how to calculate extreme maximal and minimum values of functions, and\n(3) to be capable of performing practical computations on determining areas of figures and lengths of curves.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1. Real numbers\n2. Continuous functions\n3. Elementary functions\n4. Limit\n5. Differentiations of functions\n6. The mean-value theorem\n7. Higher order derivatives\n8. Taylor's theorem\n9.
