Next, using perturbation theory a time-dependent Schroedinger equation will be solved approximately to obtain formulae, which serve as a foundation for the interpretation of various spectra arising from rotational, vibrational or electronic transitions. Then the principles of experimentally investigating the detailed structures of molecules (e.g. symmetry, bond length, orbital energy, bonding nature) will be introduced individually.","expected_learning":"　Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to\n(1) classify molecules according to the symmetries and, hence,\n　(a) promptly decide if an important integral must be zero upon examining orbital interaction or spectroscopic transition;\n　(b) construct the MOs of polyatomic molecules using symmetry adopted linear combinations;\n　(c) identify the symmetry species of a normal mode, and decide which modes are infrared or Raman active;\n(2) grasp the concept of perturbation theory and the process of formulating transition moments;\n(3) understand the theoretical backgrounds of various spectroscopies and obtain information on the geometric and electronic structures of molecules from the spectra.\n　As for corresponding criteria in the diploma policy, refer to the curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Part 1 Group Theory (Chapter 11)\n\nWeek 1\nSignificance of group theory in chemistry; Symmetry operation; Symmetry element; Point group; Symmetry classification of molecules (1).\n\nWeek 2\nSymmetry classification of molecules (2).\nLearners are encouraged to use all the knowledge they have so far acquired to determine the point groups of various molecules.\n\nWeek 3\nGroup properties; Mathematical definition of a group; Representative of operation; Matrix representation; Representation of group multiplication; Trace; Characters and classes.\n\nWeek 4\nBlock-diagonal form; Irreducible and reducible representation; Character table; Symmetry species; Symmetry properties of functions and rotations; Transformation of p AOs; reduction of a representation to the direct sum of irreducible representations.\n\nWeek 5\nCriteria for vanishing integrals; Decomposition of a direct product; Allowed or forbidden electric dipole transition of an electron in an MO to another MO; Projection operator; Symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALC).\n\nWeek 6\nConstruction of MOs for various XYn type molecules.
