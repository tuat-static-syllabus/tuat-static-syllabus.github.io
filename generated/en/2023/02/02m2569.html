The hydrodynamics has been developed in order to understand fluid dynamics, which is seemingly quite complicated, with a few basic equations. In this lecture, mathematical models for the conservation laws (for mass, momentum, and energy) and forces acting on fluids (pressure, viscous force, gravity force) will be explained in detail. As a concrete example, the students will learn some practical relations and properties for the pipe flow.\nThis course belongs to basic courses in our department curriculum.\nClasscode of Google Classroom is \"lak5uav\".","expected_learning":"At university, the students will encounter \"Hydrodynamics\" for the first time. The priority of this lecture is thus to understand the characters of fluid and its dynamics. This lecture will aim for the students to (1) understand perfectly the equation of continuity (mass conservation law), Bernoulli's equation (mechanical energy conservation law; the equation represents the relation between the pressure and the velocity), Reynolds number, and laminar/turbulent flows, (2) derive properly the mathematical models to describe typical flows, and (3) conduct practical calculations accurately.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1. General guidance: Introduction to fluid dynamics and tutorial for this lecture.\n2. What is \"fluid\"?: Introduction for important quantities describing flow motions such as density, viscosity, temperature, pressure, and velocity.\n3. Conservation law for mass (1): The concept of \"control volume\" will be explained in detail for deriving the conservation law for mass.\n4. Conservation law for mass (2): General formula of the conservation law for mass will be given in both integral and differential formulas. The students will learn the concept of \"(volume) flow rate\" and the conservation law for the flow rate.\n5. Forces acting on fluids: The students will learn the body force (gravity force), the surface force (pressure, viscous force), and the viscous nature of fluids.\n6. Fluid statics: The \"static pressure\", pressure acting on a quiescent fluid, will be formulated based on the balance between the gravity and the pressure. The students will learn the principle of manometer and the mechanism for the buoyancy force (Archimedes principle).\n7. Conservation law for momentum: General form of the conservation law for momentum will be provided. The students will exercise the way of calculating forces acting on an object in the \"steady flow\", in which the flow velocity at any position is time-independent.\n8. Summary of the course 1-7: Mid-term exam\n9. Conservation law for energy: Conservation of energy for an open system is expressed based on the idea of control volume, where mechanical work done againt the surroundings and heat transfer through the surface of control volume are taken into account. Some examples of practical design for fluid machinery will be provided.\n10. Bernoulli's equation (1): The Bernoull's equation, a special form of conservation law for mechanical energy along a streamline, will be derived.\n11. Bernoulli's equation (2): Derivation of pressure and velocity using the Bernoulli's equation in a Pitot tube (velocity meter), a Venturi tube (flow rate meter), or a water-filled tank with an open hole (Torricelli's theorem).\n12. Bernoulli's equation (3): Exercise\n13. Pipe flow and pressure loss (1): The students will formulate the pressure loss due to flow separation and friction at the wall. Furthermore, the students will learn \"laminar flow\", \"turbulent flow\", and Reynolds number that relates flows with different length scales.\n14. Pipe flow and pressure loss: (2): The lecture provides theory and practical formulas for the pressure loss in a laminar flow or a turbulent flow. The mechanism for pressure loss due to flow contraction/expansion will be explained.\n15.

The students scoring 60 total points will pass this lecture. The grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, and online tests. Standard study time set by the our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows: Normal score and assignment test: 70%, and final test: 30%. Grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Continuum equaiton, Static pressure, Bernoulli's equation, Pressure loss, Reynolds number","office_hours":"Lunch break (12:00-13:00), Questions can be asked within the office hours.","remarks_1":"Grade distribution for three years:\n(2022) Total number of students: 112，S:9， A:35， B:34， C:23， D:11\n(2021) Total number of students: 121，S:28, A:39, B: 33, C:17, D: 4\n(2020) Total number of students: 103, S: 25, A: 36, B: 27, C: 11, D: 4\n(2019) Total number of students: 123, S: 20, A: 31, B: 39, C: 20, D: 13\n(2018) Total number of students: 139, S: 18, A: 32, B: 41, C: 32, D: 16","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/9/2023 4:36:32 PM","name":{"id":366,"ja":"比較心理学","en":"Comparative Psychology"},"instructor":{"id":353,"ja":"渡邊 司","en":"WATANABE Tsukasa"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"undefined.1","references":"Sugiyama, H. et al., Fluid Dynamics, Morikita, Tokyo, 1995; Fujikawa, H., Fluid Dynamics, Baifu-kan, Tokyo, 2005; Tatsumi, T., Fluid Mechanics, Baifu-kan, Tokyo, 1982.
