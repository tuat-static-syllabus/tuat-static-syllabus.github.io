Submission of the requested reports are also to be made through it as well.\n\nThe outline of the lectures is as follows.\nApplications of ionizing radiation effects gave rise to a tremendous success in various fields of industrial and medical technologies, due to which the ionizing radiations are regarded as an indispensable tool in analytical, diagnostic, synthetic, and therapeutic engineering. A simple picture of ionizing radiation to the matter is a gigantically energetic, but extremely tiny bullet, so that ionizing radiation is penetrative and can provide large amount of energy inside materials. One can also control the size of bullet, so that can control the penetration depth by using the physical properties of matter. However, one should recognize that the use of ionizing radiation without proper understanding can cause considerable damage onto life and material with the gigantic energy.\nWe thus study fundamental properties of ionizing radiation and obtain the concept of radiation effects as the basic ground for engineers of synthesis and fabrication of materials and for those of bio-medical engineering.\nThe present series of Radiation Chemistry stand as the comprehensive development of the knowledges of physical and related subjects given in earlier lectures from a special monographic view point.","expected_learning":"(1) To become able to understand and to explain what radiation is, which involves the radiation effects characteristic to radiation energies and radiation qualities.\n(2) To become able to explain qualitatively the radiation effects to the gas, the condensed materials, and the bio-matters.\n(3) To become able to explain the basics and characteristics of the methods of investigations onto radiation chemistry.\n(4) To became aware of the applications of radiation chemistry.\nCorresponding criteria are shown in the Diploma Policy of the department of Biomedical Engineering.\nSee also the corresponding Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.
