In this course, we will learn about differentiation and integration of multivariable functions, such as partial differentiations, criteria of local maxima and minima, double and triple integrations, volumes of solids, line integrations and series. Various computations will be practiced with drawing diagrams.\n","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiation and integration of two, or multivariable functions, and\n(2) to be capable of performing practical computations.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"1. Functions of several variables\n2. Ttotal differentiations and differenciations of composite functions\n3. Higher order partial differentiations, and Taylor's theorem\n4.
