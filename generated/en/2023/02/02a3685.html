Outline: In this lecture we will understand the concept of waveform, the response of the circuit, the operation of the pulse generation circuit, etc. through the equivalent circuit and model for the electronic circuit for generating or processing the digital signal and the non-sinusoidal signal. In the first half of the lecture, you will learn how to saturate bipolar transistors and how to analyze the qualitative behavior of circuits by turning on / off diodes, and in the second half we will learn about the principle of operation and advantages and disadvantages of various construction methods of logic circuits. Especially for CMOS logic circuits used in most modern digital electronic devices, we aim to be able not only to analyze but also simple design.\n\nb. Target: Understand the concept of waveform, circuit response, operation of the pulse generation circuit, etc. through electronic circuits for generating or processing non-sinusoidal signals and digital signals through equivalent circuits and models. Furthermore, for a simple circuit, it is possible to synthesize a circuit for calculating the circuit response on its own and also for obtaining a required output.","expected_learning":"・ Circuit analysis can be performed using diodes and transistors as non-linear elements.\n・ Understand and analyze waveform generation circuits that operate non-linearly.\n・ Understand and analyze how to construct logic circuits using analog elements.\n・ Understand the operation of logic circuits using MOS transistors, and be able to analyze and design them.\n","course_schedule":"1.
