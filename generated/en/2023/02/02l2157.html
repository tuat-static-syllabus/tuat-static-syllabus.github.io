Since the characters of functional groups in organic compound are closely related to the reactivity of the organic compounds, then you will understand the variety of reactions occurring in vivo throughout the course, which is categorized as a basic subject of life science.\n<Outline> In this course, properties and reactivity of alcohols, ethers and carboxylic acids are addressed. In addition, you will learn stability and reactivity of aromatic compounds from the viewpoint of aromaticity. In each lecture, quiz-type home work is assigned which is related to the contents of the lecture. Through this course, you will learn about the electron arrows to understand the reaction.\n","expected_learning":"1) Understand the properties of alcohols, ethers, carboxylic acids and explain their reactivity using electron arrows.\n2) Aromaticity and its reactivity can be explained by using electron arrows.\n\nThis subject corresponds to the viewpoint A of the diploma policy.\n","course_schedule":"1.
