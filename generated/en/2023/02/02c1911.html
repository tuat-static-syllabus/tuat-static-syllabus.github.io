Continuity of real numbers and series\n2. Limits of functions\n3. Continuity of functions, and inverse functions\n4. Differentiations of functions with one variable\n5. The mean-value theorem and l'Hopital's rule\n6. Parametric descriptions of curves, and differentiations in high order\n7. Taylor's theorem\n8. Review\n9. Definite integrations, and indefinite integrations\n10. Exercises on integrations I\n11. Exercises on integrations II\n12. Improper integrations\n13. Applications of definite integrations I\n14. Applications of definite integrations II\n15. Review","prerequisites":"Mathematics in high schools will be used in the lecture.\nIn addition to 60 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"It will be announced in Google Classroom of this course.","message_from_instructor":"You should try to find your own suitable textbooks, and practice various problems in your private study hours.","course_keywords":"Limit, Differentiation, Inverse function, Taylor's theorem, Indefinite integration, Definite integration, Area, Length","office_hours":"Please contact me by e-mail, if necessary.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://www.tuat.ac.jp/~hataken/top.html","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/19/2023 3:17:39 PM","name":{"id":309,"ja":"物理学","en":"Physics"},"instructor":{"id":283,"ja":"吉田 敏則","en":"YOSHIDA Toshinori"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"specialized courses/ major subjects","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Fri.3～5","references":"Miyake Toshitsune, \"Nyuumon-Bibun-Sekibun\", Baifu-kan (in Japanese)"}}
