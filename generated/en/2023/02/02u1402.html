In this lecture, we start with movement of a certain mass point, proceed to vibration of several mass points linked to each other, and finally learn wave like a string. In oscillation, we can see various unique characteristics of waves: beat of two oscillations, standing wave, interference, and diffraction. The most important concept to explain these phenomena is the principle of wave superposition. Therefore, we focus on 'coupled oscillator' and 'wave superposition principle' in this lecture.","expected_learning":"?
