The leading concepts in the lecture are the entropy, the temperature, the Boltzmann factor, the chemical potential, the Gibbs factor, and the distribution function.\nEnergy: various thermodynamic potentials are also defined, such as internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, Gibbs free energy\nStatistics: there are classical and quantum statistics. In the classical statistics (the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution), particles can be distinguished. On the other hand, in the quantum statistics (Fermi-Dirac distribution or Bose-Einstein distribution), particles cannot be distinguished.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding the relationship between thermodynamics, which deals with macroscopic systems and discusses without being aware of microscopic systems, and statistical mechanics, which constitutes macroscopic systems, and the idea of statistical mechanics.\nTo be able to have multi-system energetic discussions based on. Also, be able to solve questions based on the content on your own at a certain level.","course_schedule":"Chapter 0.\"Review of themodynamics\" (wek1)\nChapter 1 \"States of a model system\" (week 2,3)\nChapter 2 \"Entropy and temperature\" (week 4,5)\nChapter 3 \"Boltzmann distribution and Helmholtz free energy\" (week 6~8)\nChapter 4 \"Thermal radiation and Planck distribution\" (week 9~10)\nmidterm exam\nChapter 5 \"Chemical potential and Gibbs distribution\" (week 10,11)\nChapter 6 \"Ideal gas\" (week 12,13)\nChapter 7 \"Fermi gas and Bose gas (week 13,14)\nChapter 8 \"Heat and work\" (week14)\nChapter9 \"Gibbs free energy and chemical reaction\" (week15)\nfinal exam","prerequisites":"Students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lecture, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Charles Kittel, “Thermal Physics” (W.
