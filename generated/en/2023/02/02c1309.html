The properties of materials are based on the properties of constituting atoms and their reactions, i.e. bonding. In this lecture, the structure and periodical characteristics of atoms, several chemical bonding between atoms, and reaction and properties of several inorganic materials are explained.","expected_learning":"Understand the structures of atoms and molecules, and the structure and reactions of liquids and solids from the view point of inorganic chemistry.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"(1) Introduction: What is inorganic chemistry\n(2)-(6) \"Text Chapter 1 and 2”\nAtomic structure: Bohr model, quantization, wave function\nPeriodic law: Electron configuration and properties of atoms / ions\nMolecular structure: localized binding approximation and basis of molecular orbital theory\n(7) Summary of atomic structures and molecular structures\nIntermediate Exam\n(8)&(9) \"Text Chapter 3 and 6”\nIonic solids: crystal lattice and lattice energy\nSymmetry of molecules and crystals: symmetry operations and symmetry elements\n(10)-(13) \"Text Chapter 4, 5 and 7”\nAcid/Base: Classification and Strength\nSolvents: Classification and Properties\nRedox: Potential and Stability\nFundamentals of coordination chemistry: structure, reactivity and stability\n(14) Application of inorganic chemistry: inorganic substances as industrial materials\n(15) Summary of ionic solids, symmetry, coordination chemistry and acid/base etc.\nFinal Exam","prerequisites":"It is indispensable contents of lessons to be taken for 2nd year inorganic chemistry II and III.\nIn addition to 30 hours you spend in the class, you are expected to prepare for and review the classes as above, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Text \"Shriver / Atkins: Inorganic Chemistry 6th Edition”\nIn addition handouts are given in the lecture.","assessment":"Exercise/homework: 20%, midterm exam: 40%, and final exam: 40%","message_from_instructor":"Chemistry is not \"Memorization\", but is structured and systematized area with quantum theory as a background.
