Quantum mechanics was once mostly of interest to physicists, chemists and other basic scientists. Now the concepts and techniques of quantum mechanics are essential in many areas of engineering and science such as materials science, nanotechnology, electronic devices, and photonics. This course is a substantial introduction to quantum mechanics and how to use it. It is specifically designed to be accessible not only to physicists but also to students and technical professionals over a wide range of science and engineering backgrounds.\n\nGoogle Classroom Code: lqpznvg","expected_learning":"After completing this course the students should be able to explain the following topics:\nphotoelectric effect, Compton scattering, photons, Franck-Hertz experiment, the Bohr atom, electron diffraction, de Broglie waves, and the wave-particle duality of matter and light.\nIntroduction to wave mechanics: Schrodinger's equation, wave functions, wave packets, probability amplitudes, stationary states, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and zero-point energies.\nSolutions to Schrodinger's equation in one dimension: transmission and reflection at a barrier, barrier penetration, potential wells, the simple harmonic oscillator.\nSchrodinger's equation in three dimensions: central potentials and introduction to hydrogenic systems.","course_schedule":"Topic 1:\nThe basic phenomena of the quantum physics and experimental background, particles and atomic models. Black-body radiation, line spectra, the photon, photoelectric effect, Compton-dispersion. Bohr's atomic model.\n\nTopic 2:\nOne-dimensional systems: The eigenvalue problem, stationary states, expectation values, operators. Particle in a box, the harmonic oscillator, transmission and reflection. Heisenberg's uncertainty relations.\n\nTopic 3:\nThree-dimensional systems. Orbital angular momentum and central motion.\nOne-electron atoms: The Schrodinger equation, energy eigenvalues wave functions, energy level diagram. Optical spectroscopy on the hydrogen atom.\nBasic perturbation theory, variational theory.\n\nTopic 4:\nMany-electron atoms: Spin. Addition of angular moments. Identical particles. The Pauli exclusion principle, The central field approximation. Zeeman effect, electron configurations, periodic system, spin-orbit coupling, terms, fine structure levels. Spectroscopies.\nFermions and bosons.\n\nTopic 5:\nApplications of quantum physics in nature, technical developments and society, for example the quantum mechanical origin of the earth's temperature, tunnel diodes and atomic magnetism.\n\nTopic 6:\nInterpretations of the state-of-the-art quantum physics. Quantum computers as a tool in the future.","prerequisites":"Basic Physics, Calculus","texts_and_materials":"物理学スーパーラーニングシリーズ 量子力学、佐川弘幸・清水克多郎 著、シュプリンガー・フェアラーク東京 (in Japanese)","assessment":"Final Exam: 80%\nHomework: 20%\nRemarks/comments/statements are considered.\n\n\nThe grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, report, and online tests. Standard study time set by our university is required to get the grade. The grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation; S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Heisenberg's Uncertainty Relations, Schrodinger Equation, Spin, Tunneling, Wavefunction","office_hours":"16:30-18:00 (Fri)","remarks_1":"Google Classroom Code: lqpznvg","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://web.tuat.ac.jp/~nanotech/index.htm","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/17/2023 10:05:17 PM","name":{"id":777,"ja":"量子力学概論","en":"Quantum Mechanics"},"instructor":{"id":548,"ja":"白樫 淳一","en":"SHIRAKASHI Junichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Thu.2","references":""}}
