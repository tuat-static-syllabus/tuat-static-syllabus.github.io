This subject is classified into Specialized Course I, which is a specialized subject of the Department of Applied Chemistry. In this lecture, we will learn the basics of polymer physics from both chemical and physical perspectives. The contents are mainly mechanical properties, thermal properties, and electrical properties, which are especially important among polymer physical properties. The goal is to acquire the basic ability to deeply understand these physical properties from a microscopic point of view, and the applied ability to link the practicality of polymers from a macroscopic point of view. Furthermore, it is important to acquire a wide range of specialized knowledge by introducing advanced research on polymer materials and observing actual samples.\nGoogle Class code: oqizwsm","expected_learning":"You can understand mechanical (stress and strain, viscoelastic), thermal (glass transition, relaxation phenomena) and electrical (dielectric, piezoelectric, conducting, ion-conductive) properties of polymeric materials.","course_schedule":"1: Class guidance and mini test (check for related lectures)\n\nMechanical properties of polymer\n2: Strain and stress of the polymers\n3: Elasticity and viscosity of polymers, viscoelastic properties\n4: Natural rubber, elasticity of rubber\n5: Dynamic viscoelastic properties, non-linear phenomenon of viscoelastic materials\n6: Molecular interpretation, time-temperature superposition principle, etc.\n\nThermal properties of polymer\n7: Measurement of thermal properties of polymers\n8: Transitions of polymer (melting and crystallization)\n9: Transitions of polymer (glass transition and enthalpy relaxation)\n10: Liquid crystalline polymers\n\nElectrical properties of polymer\n11: Dielectric properties of polymers\n12: Piezoelectric properties of polymers\n13: Electron-conducting polymers\n14: Ion-conductive polymers\n15: Applications of ion-conductive polymers\n","prerequisites":"Polymer Chemistry I and II, Polymer Physics I","texts_and_materials":"Fundamentals of Polymer Sciences (SPSJ)","assessment":"The grade evaluation method comprehensively evaluates motivation for learning using interactivity, mini-tests and report assignments, etc., and credits are given when the learning effect equivalent to the standard study time set by the university is recognized.
