In the first half of the lecture, students will learn about and deepen their understanding of movement phenomenology (momentum, heat, and mass transfer phenomena), which is the core of chemical engineering, in addition to studying it through undergraduate lectures. In the second half, the students are trained to conduct literature research on advanced research related to master's thesis research and to present oral responses. At the same time, they also acquire enough English skills to earn a master's degree.","expected_learning":"Understand the \"similarity\" of heat, mass, and momentum transfers","course_schedule":"1) First-semester (by: Lenggoro, Fushimi, Ritani)\nConduct in the form of a lecture.
