In addition, students will learn how to properly organize and communicate the results of their research and investigations, and engage in specialized discussions. In addition, students will conduct a literature review on their own research topic, and summarize the contents of the report, which is equivalent to the introduction of a master's thesis, based on the background and purpose of the research.","expected_learning":"The student is required to be able to formulate a research agenda and implementation plan for the Master's course, logically consider the results obtained, and report, present, and discuss them. In addition, the student should be able to conduct a literature survey on the research topic and related fields, and summarize the results in a report.\n\nPerspectives on the diploma policy of this course: Refer to the curriculum map in the course guide.","course_schedule":"In seminars and other events held throughout the year in each laboratory, students will make presentations and engage in discussions, such as reporting on the status of research in the Master's Program and introducing literature in the field of applied chemistry and materials. Students are encouraged to hone their research presentation skills and to engage in thorough discussions about their research with others. It is important for students to promote their research autonomously by taking advantage of guidance, advice, and criticism from their supervisors and other laboratory members. The seminar schedule varies from laboratory to laboratory.\n\nIn seminars and other events held throughout the year in each laboratory, students will make presentations and engage in discussions, such as reporting on the status of research in the Master's Program and introducing literature in the field of applied chemistry and materials.

The seminar schedule varies from laboratory to laboratory.\n\nIn addition to conducting a thorough literature survey on their own research topic and related fields, students are required to compile the contents equivalent to the introductory part of their master's thesis and submit it to the department as an applied chemistry seminar report. In the process of writing this report, it is important to reflect and brush up on the comments of the supervising professor. Through this process, students develop logical and creative thinking and contribute to the writing of a master's thesis with a high degree of completion in the second year.","prerequisites":"This course is classified as a common course and is required; it is recommended that it be taken in the first year.\nThe content of the course must be at least equivalent to the standard number of hours at the University and should be taken under the direction of an academic advisor.","texts_and_materials":"None.","assessment":"Comprehensive evaluation will be made based on the content of presentations in the seminar, participation in discussions, and the contents of the seminar report on applied chemistry.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Laboratory, seminar, literature survey","office_hours":"It depends on your advisor, so please check with your advisor.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/8/2023 7:40:02 PM","name":{"id":588,"ja":"生命化学Ⅱ","en":"Biochemistry Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":313,"ja":"下田 政博, 松本 武, 吉川 正人, 中島 正裕, 小池 伸介","en":"SHIMODA Masahiro, MATSUMOTO Takeshi, YOSHIKAWA Masato, NAKAJIMA Masahiro, KOIKE Shinsuke"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":null,"course_type":null,"facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"None."}}
