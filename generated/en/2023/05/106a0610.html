We will examine popular machine learning techniques with some practice problems for understanding of these topics. Hence, prepare your laptop for every class.\n\nThis course is designed to give an overview of various basic machine learning methods for understanding multimedia information. The course will give students an overall understanding of these fields and would make them realize that machine learning plays important roles in information technologies. The course will be based on lectures, discussions, and doing small projects (active learning style).","expected_learning":"Learners who complete this course will be able to understand:\n- multimedia information,\n- applications for multimedia,\n- techniques for machine learning.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps (Department of Computer and Information Sciences, diploma policy type A).","course_schedule":"1.
