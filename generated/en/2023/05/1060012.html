The field challenges us to consider the many ways in which people’s lives are shaped by social relations, cultural images, and historical forces. The course will familiarize students with ethnographic fieldwork methods and will question the universality of cultural categories and the breadth of differences amongst human societies, by introducing students to the primary domains of cultural anthropology: kinship and social organization; religion, belief and rituals; gender and sexuality; language in culture; economic and social exchanges. The course will also introduce students to key historical figures in 20th century anthropology and to the development of key concepts and theories, as it seeks to understand, interpret, and represent the lived world of people abroad and at home.","expected_learning":"By the end of the course, students should be able to do the following:\n1.
