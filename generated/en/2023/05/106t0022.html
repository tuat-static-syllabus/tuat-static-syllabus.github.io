This molecular shape produces unique characteristics in physical properties. We overview the statistical mechanics of the conformation of the polymer, experimental observation methods such as light scattering, the characteristic dynamics called viscoelasticity, and the relaxation phenomenon. The goal of this class is to understand the basics of polymer physical properties so that even beginners can understand, suitable for the package courses.","expected_learning":"You will be able to explain the conformation of polymer chains.\nYou will be able to explain the characteristics of physical properties unique to polymer string-like molecules.\nYou will be able to explain the the characteristics of viscoelasticity in term of dynamics.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.Guidance\n2.Statistical treatment of polymer conformation\n3.Statistical treatment of molecular weight\n4.Solvent effect and measurement methods\n5.Thermodynamics of polymer solution\n6.Semi-dilute solution system/ concentrated system\n7.Entropic elasticity\n8.Linear viscoelasticity and mechanical relaxation\n9.General theory of linear response\n10.Relaxation and resonance phenomena\n11.Viscoelasticity of amorphous polymers\n12.Mechanical Properties of Glassy Polymers\n13.Discussion and Presentation I\n14.Discussion and Presentation II\n15.Summary\n\n","prerequisites":"It is desirable to attend \"Physics of Polymers and Textiles\".
