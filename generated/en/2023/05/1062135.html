Therefore, the progress of research in the master's program is announced in front of teachers other than the supervisor, and opinions are exchanged. In addition, by exchanging opinions, the aim is to find out information that cannot be obtained through literature surveys, etc., and to find new perspectives that were not noticed by oneself, and to make use of them for their own research.\n[Outline] An interim presentation will be held in early May every year, and the progress of research in the master's program will be announced through short presentations and poster presentations. Answer questions from other students and teachers, and present questions after listening to other students' announcements.\n","expected_learning":"The progress of research in the master's program at the interim presentation will be announced, and appropriate exchange of opinions with faculty members other than supervisors will be possible.\n\nDiploma policy perspective of this course: Refer to the curriculum map in the course guide.\n","course_schedule":"Although this subject is classified as a common subject and is not treated as a required subject, participation in an interim presentation is required to complete the master's program, and it is strongly recommended to take it.\nSelf-study equivalent to at least the university's standard hours is required for taking the course, and follow the instructions of the supervisor.\n","prerequisites":"In this course, short presentations and posters will be presented at the mid-term presentation, and discussions with faculty members other than the supervisor will be held. The contents of the questions raised during the discussion will be compiled into a report and reflected in future research. Also, listen to others' presentations, hold discussions, and submit questionnaires.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Evaluate by attendance / presentation / report. Do not add attendance alone.\n\n","message_from_instructor":"The interim presentation is a milestone for summarizing the master's thesis, and is a valuable opportunity to receive advice from different perspectives from teachers and students from various fields.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/5/2023 3:19:06 PM","name":{"id":570,"ja":"数学基礎","en":"Basic Mathematics"},"instructor":{"id":313,"ja":"下田 政博, 松本 武, 吉川 正人, 中島 正裕, 小池 伸介","en":"SHIMODA Masahiro, MATSUMOTO Takeshi, YOSHIKAWA Masato, NAKAJIMA Masahiro, KOIKE Shinsuke"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":null,"course_type":null,"facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
