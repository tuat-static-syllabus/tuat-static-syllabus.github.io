The first part of each lecture is used to acquire knowledge of the devices and communication protocols that make up information and communication networks, from the basics to the latest technologies. The second part uses the second half of each lecture and includes exercises to consolidate the knowledge learned. The exercises will include group discussions and presentations as necessary to provide students with opportunities to share the knowledge they have acquired.\n\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Assessment is carried out using assignments presented in class.\n","message_from_instructor":"In this lecture, in addition to learning about information and communication networks, the lecturers will share their own experiences of being involved in research and development as research engineers in companies.
