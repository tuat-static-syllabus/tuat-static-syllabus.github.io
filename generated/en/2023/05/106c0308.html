Therefore, it is very important for researchers and engineers who do not specialize in organometallic chemistry to acquire knowledge and skills in organometallic chemistry in the future. The purpose of this lecture is to enable students to understand and acquire the latest organometallic chemistry and catalytic chemistry necessary for future front-line researchers and engineers in synthetic organic chemistry.\n\nIn this lecture, we will discuss the basics of organometallic chemistry and safety in handling organometallic compounds, how to handle organometallic reagents such as alkyllithium and Grignard reagents, and how to devise new methods in reactions, as well as catalytic reactions using transition metal compounds and the latest research results and innovations.\n\n　By taking this course, students will be able to acquire the knowledge of the properties and handling methods of organometallic compounds and the knowledge and innovations in reactions that are necessary for front-line researchers and engineers in synthetic organic chemistry. By understanding all of the lectures, you will acquire the highest level of knowledge in the world.","expected_learning":"Students should be able to understand the properties and handling methods of organometallic reactants and catalysts. In addition, students should be able to apply this knowledge to synthetic organic chemistry.\n\nFor the curriculum policy of this course, please refer to the curriculum map in the course guide.","course_schedule":"【Lesson 1】Definition of organometallic compounds and their ligands\n【Lesson 2】18-electron rule and electronic and formal oxidation states of complexes\n【Lesson 3】Structures and Ligands of Organometallic Compounds\n【Lesson 4】Elementary reactions in catalytic reactions\n【Lesson 5】How to handle organometallic compounds - For safe handling\nHow to Handle Organometallic Compounds - For Safe Handling -\n【Lesson 6】 Organometallic Reagents (Organolithium)\n【Lesson 7】Organometallic reagents (organomagnesium)\n【Lesson 8】Summary\n　　　　　Mid-term examination\n【Lesson 9】Catalytic hydrogenation\n【Lesson 10】C-H Bond Activation Reactions\n【Lesson 11】C-O and C-C bond activation\n【Lesson 12】Cross Coupling\n【Lesson 13】Tsuji-Trost reaction\n【Lesson 14】Oxidative Coupling and Chain Dimerization\n【Lesson 15】Summary\n　　　　　Periodic examination","prerequisites":"This lecture is an advanced course of the undergraduate course \"Transition Metal Chemistry\". Students should have taken Organic Chemistry I, II, III, Inorganic Chemistry I, II, III, and Transition Metal Chemistry in the undergraduate course. Students who have not taken these courses are also allowed to take this course, but the lecture will be given on the assumption that they know the contents of these courses. Therefore, it is important to reflect on these lectures, and four hours of study is required each week, including preparation, lectures, homework, assignment reports, and review.\n","texts_and_materials":"PowerPoint files for the lecture will be distributed in advance. However, due to copyright issues, the files are to be used only for your own study and may not be copied, distributed, or otherwise made available to any unspecified person. Anyone who violates this rule will be asked to withdraw from the course. Assignments and homework will be given through Google Classroom. The class code is as follow: oumo6dj\n\n","assessment":"Students will be graded on a total of 10 points for homework and reports, 40 points for the mid-term exam, 40 points for the final exam, and 10% for other points, with 90 points or more being an S, 80 points or more but less than 90 points being an A, 70 points or more but less than 80 points being a B, 60 points or more but less than 70 points being a C, and 60 points or more but less than 60 points being a D or E. and less than 60 points as D or E.\n\nThese are subject to change in response to new coronavirus infections.","message_from_instructor":"This course will be useful not only for students who specialize in organometallic chemistry, but also for those who specialize in synthetic organic chemistry. It will not only provide students with knowledge and skills that will be useful for their own thesis research in these fields, but will also be useful when they become involved in research and development in these fields in the future. In the early stages of the course, we have designed the course so that students with no basic knowledge of organometallic chemistry can take it easily. Please be sure to submit all assignments. Please note that this is a graduate school class, so if you have not reached a certain level, you will not be evaluated.\n\n","course_keywords":"Organometallic Chemistry, Molecular Catalysis","office_hours":"Monday, 12 AM-13 PM.
