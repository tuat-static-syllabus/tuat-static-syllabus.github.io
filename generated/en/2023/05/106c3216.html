The purpose of this course is to provide students with the opportunity to present the progress of their research in the Master's Course in front of faculty members other than their supervisors, to exchange opinions, and to discover information and new perspectives that cannot be obtained through literature survey and other means.\nStudents are expected to take this course in their first year of the Master's program, and to present the progress of their research in the Master's program at the midterm presentation scheduled in December. Students will answer questions from other students and faculty members, as well as present questions after listening to other students' presentations.","expected_learning":"Briefly explain her/his own research in the Master's course.

In addition, during the time outside of their own presentation time, they are expected to attend other research presentations and ask questions. The questions raised during these discussions will be summarized in a report. In particular, advice from faculty members who are not only close to the research field but also from faculty members who specialize in different fields may bring different methods and ways of thinking from information obtained at academic conferences, etc., and is expected to be reflected in the development of future research.","prerequisites":"This course is classified as a common subject and is required.
