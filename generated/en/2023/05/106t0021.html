Therefore, it is a clue leading to the development of novel useful materials to learn the chemical properties of the known heterocycles. In this course, the reactivities and synthetic methods of representative heterocycles were explained.\nclass code: v7maahc\nIn this course, lectures are given using Microsoft PowerPoint. In each lecture, handouts are distributed.","expected_learning":"1. To understand concepts, systematic classifications, names and structures of various heterocycles.\n2. To understand chemical functions, reactivities and synthetic methods of electron-rich and electron-poor heterocycles.\n3.
