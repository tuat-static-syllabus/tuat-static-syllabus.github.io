Students will acquire up-to-date knowledge of a wide range of applied chemistry and related fields, from basic to cutting-edge, and experience the frontlines of applied chemistry research through laboratory visits. The course also aims to provide students with a multifaceted view of various research fields and issues related to applied chemistry outside their own field of specialization, to understand the differences from their own field of specialization, and to reflect on the possibilities of reflecting the findings of these different fields and of collaboration with them.\n\n[Summary] The faculty members of the Department of Applied Chemistry take turns to give one lecture per session, covering fundamentals and topics in their respective fields of expertise, as well as their own research results, in an easy-to-understand manner to students in various fields of research. In addition, a tour of the laboratories of the Department of Applied Chemistry will be conducted at the same time. In principle, lectures will be given in English.\n\nClass code: to be determined\n","expected_learning":"Students will be able to grasp the overall picture of various research fields related to applied chemistry. In addition, they will be able to consider the differences from their own field of specialization and the possibilities for collaboration. For Japanese students, they will be able to understand these in English.\n\nPerspectives on the diploma policy of this course: Please refer to the curriculum map in the course guide.","course_schedule":"Each lecture will be given by a faculty member of the Department of Applied Chemistry in an omnibus format. The lectures will cover basic, applied, and cutting-edge topics in a wide range of fields of applied chemistry, and will be given in English, and laboratory tours will also be conducted. The lecturers in charge of each lecture will change from year to year, and the lecture content and schedule will differ accordingly.\n\n1st Class Guidance\n2nd-15th Lectures and laboratory visits by faculty members of the Department of Applied Chemistry","prerequisites":"In addition to the class time, students should refer to the distributed materials, etc., and prepare and review according to the standard number of hours at the University.","texts_and_materials":"none in particular","assessment":"Students will submit reports on the assignments for each lecture.
