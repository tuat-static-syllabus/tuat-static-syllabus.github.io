Topics are relevant to environmental engineering, environmental biotechnology, microbial ecology, and so on. Throughout this course, a student will discuss and understand what a research question of his/her master thesis is all about.","expected_learning":"A student will learn how to rationally explain the border between findings and unknown things and how to convince an audience of the novelty and originality of his/her master thesis. Throughout the discussion, a student will be equipped with the way to raise a research question and to design his/her experiment to answer the question.","course_schedule":"Students will give presentations on literature reviews on the state-of-the-art findings and technologies to which their research topics are relevant. They are required to make sure of why their research is important and what impact it brings. In addition, they are asked to come up with questions for each presenter. Hence, active participation in a Q&A session is demanded.","prerequisites":"Not specifically.","texts_and_materials":"Not specifically.","assessment":"The evaluation will be depending on how profound students perform a literature review, how much they understand the originality and novelty, and how active they participate in the discussion.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"wastewater treatment, microbiology, water, global warming, environmental pollution","office_hours":"Please send email to make an appointment: akte@cc.tuat.ac.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/4/2023 9:28:18 AM","name":{"id":609,"ja":"熱統計力学","en":"Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics"},"instructor":{"id":408,"ja":"古市 達哉（岩）, 木﨑 景一郎（岩）, 石原 加奈子, 福島 隆治, 渡辺 元","en":"FURUICHI Tatsuya, KIZAKI Keiichirou, ISHIHARA Kanako, FUKUSHIMA Ryuji, WATANABE Gen"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":null,"course_type":null,"facility_affiliation":"Scleroprotein and Leather Research Institute","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Will give relevant references occasionally."}}
