We will formally analyze the words we normally use without much thought in order to think about \"language\" from a new perspective.\n\nSemantics and Pragmatics are two sub-disciplines of linguistics that explore the meaning conveyed by words. Semantics analyze the \"literal meaning\" easily captured in logical formulae, whereas pragmatics analyze the meaning that arises when words are used in discourse. As the latter is hard to formalize, \"formal pragmatics\", the topic of this course, are a relatively new discipline with a lots open research questions.\n\nPragmatic meaning as defined above is crucial for the understanding of meaning conveyed by words as they are actually used, and thinking about it is indispensable for understanding human communication. To attain a deeper understanding of pragmatic meaning, we will use basic methodology from mathematical logic to analyze various aspects of non-literal meaning and learn to look and understand the meaning of words holistically.\n\nPlease register to class fsvopzc in Google classroom.","expected_learning":"Get to know natural language phenomena that are in the scope of pragmatics and understand its basic concepts. Be able to independently analyze concrete phenomena with the tools of formal pragmatics. By accomplishing this, becoming able to look at language from a more objective perspective and use language more efficiently.","course_schedule":"1. Overview of Pragmatics, Basic Concepts\n2.

Academic progress deemed equivalent to the standard study time set by our university is required for credit. The ability of participants to capture language as a phenomenon from a pragmatic perspective, and to apply the formal pragmatic methods acquired in the course to the analysis of concrete linguistic phenomena will be assessed. The evaluation is weighted as follows: class participation: 30%, regular assignments: 30%, term paper: 40%.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Linguistiscs, Pragmatics, Formal Logic","office_hours":"Appointments can be requested by email.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/1/2023 7:43:25 PM","name":{"id":599,"ja":"メディシナルケミストリー","en":"Medicinal Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":391,"ja":"石原 加奈子, 大森 啓太郎, 彦野 弘一（岩）, 佐藤 洋（岩)","en":"ISHIHARA Kanako, OHMORI Keitaro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Fri.4","references":"Betty J.
