From the phonological, morphological, semantic, syntactic, and typological perspectives, students will examine various topics like spatial cognition, conceptual metaphor, frame, animal communication, and Pokemon. This course seeks to develop the knowledge to answer the question of “what is linguistics?” and “what is language?”. Moreover, through group work, students will acquire communication skills to convey their ideas accurately by sharing knowledge and actively discussing with their peers.\nThis class will be conducted face-to-face.","expected_learning":"Course goals:\n1) To acquire basic knowledge of Cognitive Linguistics.\n2) To learn how to use tools (corpus, linguistic databases, etc.) for linguistic analysis and to be able to analyze familiar language phenomena logically.","course_schedule":"Week 1 Introduction / What is language?\nWeek 2 Corpus Linguistics / The tools for linguistic analysis\nWeek 3 Semantics I / Prototype: Why a robin is more “bird-like” than a penguin?\nWeek 4 Semantics II / Frame Semantics I: What is the difference between “shore” and “coast”?\nWeek 5 Semantics III / Frame Semantics II: What is the meaning of \"naku\"?\nWeek 6 Semantics IV / Frame Semantics III: Let's explore FrameNet\nWeek 7 Semantics V / Metaphor and Metonymy: IDEAS ARE FOOD, ANGER IS FIRE, and LOVE IS WAR\nWeek 8 Semantics VI / Metaphor and Politics\nWeek 9 Phonetics / Sound symbolism: Considering the link between sound and meaning from Gojira and Pokemon\nWeek 10 Pragmatics / The theory of “Politeness Principle”and the principle of cooperation: Ironic language\nWeek 11 Syntax / Construction Grammar: Why does \"Mary baked me a cake\" has a meaning of giving?\nWeek 12 Morphology / Construction Morphology: How were \"tapiru\", \"emoi\" and \"wakarimi\" made?\nWeek 13 Typology / Space Cognition and Motion Expression: What if there are no words for left and right\nWeek 14 Animal Communication / Bird’s singing, whale song, and honey bee dance: Do animals have languages?\nWeek 15 Discussion and Summary","prerequisites":"Students are recommended to prepare for, and review, the classes using the textbook and the reference books, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the university for each class. Students must attend at least 2/3 of a course in order to receive credit for that course.
