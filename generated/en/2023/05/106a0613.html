In this lecture, we will learn about various problems handled in \"Layout design\" which is the final stage of the lecture, how they are modeled, and what kind of efficient algorithms are solved. With this knowledge gained knowledge of the automatic design procedure of the VLSI layout and it is expected that when it becomes necessary to solve some problem, we can learn the procedure to formulate the problem and solve it efficiently.","expected_learning":"・ Understand how to model practical problems and formulate them into combinatorial optimization problems.\n・ Understand the efficient solutions and limits of various combinatorial optimization problems.\n","course_schedule":"After every lecture we will do exercises as much as possible and we will proceed to understand the content of the lecture on that day on the spot. As for specific contents, the following problems are planned.\n・ Basics of VLSI design, foundation of graph theory\n・ Diffusion sharing problem of MOS transistors\n・ Module inversion problem\n・ Slice structure floor plan search problem\n・ Area minimization problem due to module rotation\n・ Grid wiring problem\n・ Channel wiring problem\n・ Minimizing the number of vias\n・ K type paste problem\n・ General structure packing problem","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"none","assessment":"By reports.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Integrated circuit, layout design, combination problem, algorithm, computational complexity, graph theory","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/27/2023 3:58:18 PM","name":{"id":2743,"ja":"計算機システム特論Ⅰ","en":"Advanced Computer system I"},"instructor":{"id":656,"ja":"藤吉 邦洋","en":"FUJIYOSHI Kunihiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Wed.2","references":"Books on VLSI design and books on discrete algorithms\nSadiq M.
