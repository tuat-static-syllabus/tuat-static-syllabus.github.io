Advances in genome analysis are supported by various technological developments, and those developing new technologies are leading the way. In the first half of this lecture, we introduce the history and current state of genome analysis, and explain in detail the progress and current situation of analysis technology. In addition, we introduce mass spectrometry and genetic modification technology used for identification of expressed proteins and analysis of post-translational modifications, as a technique using genomic information.\n\nClasscode: l6kzzbf","expected_learning":"Learn the basic knowledge on genome analysis and understand the technology that becomes the basis. In addition, we will master the fundamentals of mass spectrometry technology and genetic modification technology.\n","course_schedule":"Dr.Yohda\nHistory of Human Genome Analysis: We will explain the history and background of human genome analysis.\nAdvances in genome analysis technology: Explain the progress of technologies realizing genome analysis.\nCurrent status of genome analysis: We introduce the current state of genome analysis and discuss future direction.\nAdvances in DNA sequencing technology: Explain the development of automatic sequencer and capillary array DNA sequencer. In case\nUltrafast DNA sequencing technology: technology of next generation DNA sequencer We will explain the third generation DNA sequencer.\nFuture of DNA sequencing: We introduce trend of development of 3rd generation DNA sequencer such as 1 molecule sequencer.\n\nDr. Sinohara\n[1] Gene targeting by homologous recombination [2] We introduce knockout mouse production technology and transgenic mouse production technology by recently developed genome editing technology such as ZINC FINGER, TALEN, Crisper-Cas, etc. This will acquire the historical background of the development of development engineering and basic knowledge on the latest technology.\n\nDr. Noguchi\nLecture on mass spectrometry method used for identification of proteins expressed based on genomic information and analysis of posttranslational modification. The first half describes the principle of ionization and mass separation of proteins and peptides, and the latter part introduces the protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting etc.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Report 100%\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Monday 10:30 - 12:00","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/17/2023 10:26:43 AM","name":{"id":471,"ja":"環境衛生学","en":"Environmental Hygienics"},"instructor":{"id":501,"ja":"渡邊 敏行, 富永 洋一","en":"WATANABE Toshiyuki, TOMINAGA Yoichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
