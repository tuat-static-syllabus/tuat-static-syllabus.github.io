The ultimate goal is to train students to write reports based on their own research work and to communicate with other researchers and scientists in English. To achieve this goal, students will be required to read and discuss sample publications.\nIn addition to the topics below, there will also be discussions on global issues to broaden the knowledge of students interested in working in an international organization. There will also be discussions on the search for sustainable ways of utilizing global resources to satisfy our 5F (Food, Fiber, Feed, Fuel, and Fertilizer) needs.\n\n","expected_learning":"At the end of the lecture, students should be able to acquire enough oral communication skills to enable them to:\n(1) Present their research work orally in English.\n(2) Participate in seminars, workshops, discussions, ask questions and express their opinions in English.\n(3) Write reports based on their own research findings, and share them with other researchers in English.\n\n","course_schedule":"Week 1: Orientation: Explanation of the course content and grading criteria\nWeek 2: Communicating in multi-cultural societies\nWeek 3: Scientific journals and impact factors\nWeek 4: Making research titles attractive\nWeek 5: A brief explanation of the main components of a scientific paper (Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results and Discussion, Conclusions, References, Acknowledgement)\nWeek 6: Sentence and paragraph connectors frequently used by native English writers in articles\nWeek 7: Identifying and correcting errors in scientific reports\nWeek 8: Writing reports based on “model experiments” ?
