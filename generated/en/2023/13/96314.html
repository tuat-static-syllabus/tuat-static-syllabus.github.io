However, extensive burning of fossil fuels has increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases well beyond historical levels. Such changes have accompanied increased global temperatures, suggesting a substantively altered world climate. Moreover, they are depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, acid rain or long-range trans-boundary air pollution, and so on.\nThe negative impacts of global environment changes on the forest ecosystem, such as rising temperatures, increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, methane and ozone, and an increase in natural disasters, are much more noticeable in many parts on the world. This lecture focuses primarily on the effects of global environmental changes on the forest ecosystem.\n","expected_learning":"Understand the following items\n・Explain the mechanism of environmental change on a global scale.\n・Explain the effects of microclimate changes on trees.\n・Explain the functions and roles of forest ecosystems.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.
