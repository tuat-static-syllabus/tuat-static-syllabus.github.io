Due to materials which are produced from trees, wood properties are affected by growth condition of trees. Relationships between tree growth and wood quality should be clarified to effectively obtain wood resources. The present lecture will introduce recent research results in the relationships between tree growth and wood quality.\n\n","expected_learning":"【Saito】\nTo enable students to understand the development and reality of agricultural production technology from the angle of bio-environmental regulation.\nTo understand the basic reactions between plants and the environment, and to understand the current state-of-the-art agricultural technologies (plant factories and smart agriculture).\nTo acquire a high level of expertise as an independent researcher and creative engineer in the field of agricultural environmental engineering by learning the state-of-the-art knowledge and technology in the specialized field of agricultural science.
