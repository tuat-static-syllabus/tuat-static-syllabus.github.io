This lecture will provide advanced knowledge and skills in the field of applied life sciences.\nLiving organisms produce energies and biomaterials in cells, to maintain their life. The production activities absolutely depend on reactions catalyzed by enzymes. However, some enzymes can not complete the reactions by themselves and require substances called \"coenzymes\" for the reactions. In this lecture, I will talk about species, functions, and biosynthesis of coenzymes, especially acyl-carrier, CoA, providing the most up-to-date information.\n","expected_learning":"・ Ability to explain the relationship between coenzymes and vitamins.\n・ Ability to explain the role of coenzymes.\n・ Ability to explain the in vivo kinetics of coenzymes.\n・ Ability to discuss the application of the coenzyme biosynthetic pathways as a drug target.\nPlease refer to the curriculum map of the course guide for the correspondence between the contents of this lecture and the diploma policy of this course.\n","course_schedule":"1. Species, structures, and functions of coenzymes (ATP, NAD(P)H, CoA, etc).\n2. Biosynthetic pathways of coenzymes (relationship of vitamins and coenzymes).\n3. CoA biosynthetic pathway, its regulation mechanisms, and changes of intracellular CoA and its thioesters (bacteria, archaea, and eukarya)\n4. Application of coenzyme biosynthetic pathways to drag targets.\n","prerequisites":"In addition to the 7.5 hours of class time and the time required to create reports, etc., refer to the distributed lecture materials and reference books, and prepare and review according to the standard number of hours of the university.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided in the class.","assessment":"Class participation attitude: 30%\nReport: 70%\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"coenzyme, vitamin, metabolism, enzyme","office_hours":"Questions will be accepted at the end of lecture and through e-mail after the lecture. shigeru.chohnan.agr[at]vc.ibaraki.ac.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/2/2023 3:56:11 PM","name":{"id":869,"ja":"先端応用化学演習","en":"Frontier Chemistry Seminar"},"instructor":{"id":688,"ja":"岩井 伯隆","en":"IWAI Noritaka"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"United Graduate School Agricultural Science","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"To be announced in the lecture."}}
