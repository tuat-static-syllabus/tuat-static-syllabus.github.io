Autonomic functions are the most basic functions of living organisms, such as circulation, respiration, digestion, metabolism, secretion, thermoregulation, excretion, and reproduction. The autonomic nervous system works to maintain the homeostasis of the body by coordinating various autonomic functions. In this lecture, we will outline the basics of the autonomic nervous system and the central control of autonomic functions, including the latest findings. In addition, we will introduce diseases causing autonomic dysfunction.\nThis course is designed for students to acquire advanced specialized skills in the field of applied life sciences by learning cutting-edge knowledge and technologies in agricultural sciences.","expected_learning":"1) Understand the basics of the autonomic nervous system.\n2) Understand the central regulation of autonomic functions.\n3) Obtain knowledge about diseases causing autonomic dysfunction.\n","course_schedule":"1.
