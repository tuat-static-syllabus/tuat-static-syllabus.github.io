In this lecture, the metabolic regulatory functions of proteins and amino acids and their mechanisms will be reviewed.\n　1. Metabolic regulatory function of amino acids\nAmino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins, also exist in free form in cells and plasma, and it has become clear that these free amino acids play a variety of roles in the body. In the first half of this lecture, we will focus on branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), which are the amino acids whose metabolic regulatory functions have been most extensively analyzed, and review their functions in regulating body protein metabolism, glucose metabolism, and body temperature.\n　２. Metabolic regulatory function of protein\nProtein deprivation induces fatty liver and the enhancement of energy expenditure as well as growth retardation and the decreased muscle mass. These metabolic changes are mediated by a variety of hormones. In the latter half, we will focus on insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21, and review how they regulate metabolisms under protein deprivation.\n\n","expected_learning":"●Understand that amino acids are not just components of proteins, but also function as biological regulators that regulate metabolism in their free form, and be able to explain their functions.\n●Understand the molecular biology of insulin, IGF-1, and FGF21, and be able to explain how they exert their physiological function.\n","course_schedule":"●Metabolic regulatory function of amino acids\n1.

BCAAs are truly a nutrient to watch as a next-generation biological regulator. I believe it will change the way you look at amino acids. (Yoshizawa)\n●The 20th century is the golden age for endocrinology, but the research interests tend to be on decline. The molecular mechanisms by which the hormones regulate metabolisms in response to the nutritional states are hot issues to be determined even now. As an agricultural researcher, we should cherish the “normal” metabolism of “normal” animals and think these issues.
