But if you explain the reason of the certain animal behavior only from one side of the research field, your interpretation may be not enough. Animal morphology, that understand the structure of the body of animals, must be one of the essential academic fields to understand the nature of animals. This lecture gives some examples that the morphological study helped the interpretation of animal behaviors or abilities.\n√　This class will be held to acquire advanced professional ability of animal management by learning the basal and latest knowledge and skills in the field of animal sciences.\n","expected_learning":"√　Understanding the general body structures of animals and special body structures of managed animals.\n√　Understanding the importance of understanding animal morphology to achieve the suitable animal management..\n","course_schedule":"1) What is Animal Morphology?\nFirstly, we must learn about the animal morphology. In the first lecture, the history, research fields, and significance of animal morphology will be explained.\n2) Animal Morphology and Animal Behavior / Animal Physiology\nBased The origin of the word “Animal” is the “Anima”, that means “Movement”. In many cases, morphology observe the animal bodies that do not move anymore, but this study field is essential to explain the movement of animals. The second lecture explain the significance of morphology for the animal science.\n3) Animal morphology for livestock\nFor the suitable management of livestock, it is necessary to understand the nature of managed animals. In the third lecture, the examples of using the knowledge of morphology to manage the farm animals.\n4) Animal morphology for research animals and zoo animals\nIn the last lecture, the examples of using the knowledge of morphology to manage the research and zoo animals.\n","prerequisites":"Only one prerequisite is to understand you are also one of the animals.","texts_and_materials":"●Handouts will be provided in class.","assessment":"●I'll take attendance in the beginning of the lecture and evaluate attitude during class.\n●The student must submit the report about Animal Morphology.","message_from_instructor":"If you are interested in the deftly of abilities of animals (or other organisms), it is enough to attend this lecture. .","course_keywords":"Animal，Morphology, Behavior, Physiology, Animal Management","office_hours":"Monday 12:00〜13:00　Please contact via e-mail 　aoyamam@cc.utsunomiya-u.ac.jp　","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/2/2023 12:31:41 PM","name":{"id":853,"ja":"計算機ネットワーク","en":"Computer Networks"},"instructor":{"id":682,"ja":"宮浦 千里, 稲田 全規","en":"MIYAURA Chisato, INADA Masaki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":null,"office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"\n"}}
