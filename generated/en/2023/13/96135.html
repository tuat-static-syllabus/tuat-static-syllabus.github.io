Biological phenomena are controlled by the involvement of various low-molecular-weight physiologically active substances. Chemical synthesis of physiologically active substances and their probes are required. Basic methodologies, novel methodologies, and recent advances in chemical biology in the chemical synthesis of target compounds are explained.\n","expected_learning":"By studying this lecture, you will be able to understand the overview of basic methodologies, new methodologies, and recent advances in chemical biology in the chemical synthesis of small-molecule bioactive substances, and be able to understand the basic reaction of probing. Appropriate introduction of functional groups to target low-molecular-weight physiologically active substances can be planned.","course_schedule":"1. Basic methodologies, novel methodologies and chemical biology in chemical synthesis\n2. Synthesis of coronatine and jasmonate signaling probes\n3. Synthesis of probes for biosynthetic studies of diterpene-related compounds\n4. Synthesis of flower bud inducer KODA derivative and its probe\n","prerequisites":"In addition to the 7.5 hours of class time and the time required to write reports, etc., refer to the distributed lecture materials and reference books, and prepare and review according to the standard number of hours at the university. A review of organic chemistry and natural products chemistry is required to understand this lecture.","texts_and_materials":"・Reference materials will be distributed during class.\n・Study general textbooks on organic chemistry and natural product chemistry.\n","assessment":"・Class participation attitude 30% (questions and answers and presentations in class)\n・Report 70% (choose a paper related to the class and submit the summary in a report)\n","message_from_instructor":"I hope you will understand the importance of chemical synthesis of biologically active substances in the study of biological phenomena.\n","course_keywords":"bioactive substances, chemical biology, chemical synthesis, total synthesis, chemical probes","office_hours":"Questions, etc. will be accepted at the end of the lecture or by e-mail. hiroaki.toshima.spb540@vc.ibaraki.ac.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/6/2023 10:59:24 AM","name":{"id":863,"ja":"生体機能工学演習Ⅱ","en":"Seminar for Bio-Functional Engineering Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":685,"ja":"中澤 靖元, 中村 史","en":"NAKAZAWA Yasumoto, NAKAMURA Chikashi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"・Study general textbooks on organic chemistry and natural product chemistry."}}
