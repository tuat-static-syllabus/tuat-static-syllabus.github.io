Based on this information, specific examples of environmental pollution by heavy metals and the \"adaptation\" of organisms will be presented to provide hints for considering how to deal with heavy metals in the future.","expected_learning":"Understanding the nature of heavy metals as pollutants and their use by humans as a cause of pollution.\nUnderstanding of aspects of heavy metals as essential elements.\nUnderstanding the ecological pollution caused by heavy metals and the current state of \"adaptation\" of wildlife.\nBased on the above understanding, begin to consider sustainable options for solving heavy metal pollution and conserving wildlife.","course_schedule":"The following topics will be lectured on\n1. Aspects of heavy metals as pollutants and the history and current status of their use by mankind\n2. Aspects of heavy metals as essential elements and the case for their adaptation by wildlife\n3. The actual contamination of wildlife by heavy metals and the actual \"adaptation\" that is occurring\n4.
