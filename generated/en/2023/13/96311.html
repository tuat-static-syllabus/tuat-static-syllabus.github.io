In Asia region highest rate of primary rain forest area loss (22 million ha and 1.2%) is documented, and logging as major causes of deforestation is highlighted (2.1 million ha and 0.7%) (FAO Logging Statistics, 1981-1990). In some area logging preceded total deforestation for agriculture by extensive shifting cultivation. And drought due to El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also has been found to have a strong influence on forest ecosystems, especially in tropical rain forest. On the process various spatial scales of remnant forests are appearing. There are some difficulties of natural regeneration and ecosystem rehabilitation of the degraded and fragmented forests after logging and shifting cultivation. However, there are little information of fragmentation effects on the resilience of remnant forests, and life history and habitat preference of the component species in the fragmented forests. To clarify the processes and future trajectories of the forest dynamics, long term demographic records with large population size for the component species and also the effects by human intervention are indispensable to solve the problems.\nThis course will teach the scientific principles of forest fragmentation and techniques of restoring degraded tropical forests. Examples are from humid tropics, seasonal tropics and sub-tropics in South East and East Asia. Also ecological and socio-economic problems affecting specific forest stands are discussed.\n","expected_learning":"1)Understanding the present status of forest degradation in Tropical and Sub-tropical Asia, 2) Understanding the change of tree community structure, the effects of anthropogenic disturbance and the resilience of forest stand structure through processes of forest degradation. 3) Participation of lively interactive discussion by participants on the basis of their individual experiences.","course_schedule":"Contents of topics:\n1) Outlines and present status of fragmentation and restoration of Tropical forests in South East and East Asia\n2) Case studies 1: Fragmentation effects of Mixed Dipterocarp Forests on the resilience and tree floristic richness in north western Borneo: A comparison of 52ha forest dynamics plot in Lambir National Park and the adjacent remnant forests.\n3) Case studies 2: Succession processes and the management of secondary forests after shifting cultivation in montane forests, northern Thailand.\n4) Case studies 3: Effects of landuse changes on the vegetation succession, soil and restoration passways in degraded sub-tropical karst area in southern China.\n5) Discussion and Conclusion\n","prerequisites":"Check the following key words before classroom attendance: Tropical rain forest, Tropical seasonal forest, Sub-tropical forest, Tropical montane forest, Borneo, Shifting cultivation, Tropical karst, Rock desertification, Vegetation restoration.\nAfter checking key words and before attending the classroom, as to case studies you forest restoration and/or natural resource management issues and the projects to solve the issues relating to local/global environmental conservation (Forestry and others) in an area/a country where you are interested in, or you are already involving. And you prepare the answers/idea of the following questions.\nWhat was the background of the issues behind?\nWhat was the project about?\nLesson learned from the project?\nWhat were the strengths of the project?\nWhat were the weakness of the project?\nWhat were the things you would do differently?\nWhat were the things you can do at home?\n","texts_and_materials":"To be announced in the LMS and in the lectures.","assessment":"Class participation 20%: Attendance and contribution to group activities (surveys and presentations) will be evaluated.
