Exercise course in observation\"\n〇Lecturer：Professor Friedrich Weltzien（University of Hanover）\n　　　 Ms Vanessa Karre（Illustrator）\n○Date and time？May 13(Sat), 2023. 10:30〜14:30　\n○Place ？Leading Seminar Room, 2nd floor of BASE bldg. Koganei-campus\n〇Contents：The ability to see is not a passive reception. It is an activity on physiological, neurological and imaginative levels. To carefully observe therefor can be trained. This training will help to analyse structures or materials for instance to identify potential flaws or mistakes. It also opens ways for innovative thinking as it stimulates imagination and spark new ideas. This training helps to think outside the box, find unconventional answers or solve wicked problems. The course will be divided into two steps. First there will be a theoretical introduction (Friedrich Weltzien) and secondly a practical exercise (Vanessa Karre). The exercise will consist of making ink blots and interpreting them. The challenge will be to translate these images made by chance into some mechanical device. As a result the students learned to practice observation skills, they will be able to develop their own creative strategy, they will find a deeper understanding of creativity as a tool of problem solving ? plus they might find a way to understand and use Art in relation to their own professional interests. The students are kindly asked to bring some paper (not to small, different qualities, e.g. printing paper, newspaper, tissue, sketch block…), ink (or any other colouring liquid like soy sauce, ketchup, coffee…), scissors and glue.\n\n　　　\n■Class 2“美術と社会〜画家フィンセント・ファン・ゴッホを事例に〜”\n\"Art and Society - An example of the Painter Vincent van Gogh\"\n○ Lecturer: Natsuko Ohashi(Curator, Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum)\n○ Date & Time: 10:30 - 16:15 (Sat or Sun during May to June, Adjust due to student's schedule)\n○ Leading Seminar Room, 2nd floor of BASE bldg.
