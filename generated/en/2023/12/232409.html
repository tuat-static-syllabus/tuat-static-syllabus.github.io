In this lecture, we study how to describe phenomena in a mathematical form. Especially, we focus on a phenomenon that is included in your Ph. D thesis and try to construct a reasonable mathematical model. On the basis of results in Advanced Designing of Functional Materials I, we further your researches using mathematical modeling.","expected_learning":"Understanding a basics of mathematical modeling\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps for BASE.\n","course_schedule":"This course is in a face-to-face discussion style.\n\nWe pick up some of phenomena that students are studying and try to construct a mathematical model.\nThe content depends on students but the following is an example.\n\n1st - 3rd\nMathematical modelling based on your own original idea.\n\n4th - 6th\nValidity, usability and generality of the model.\n\n7th - 8th\nrevision of the model and application to your research.\n","prerequisites":"Students should understand fundamental methods to solve diffrential equations.\n\nIn addition to 15 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"discussion (100%).
