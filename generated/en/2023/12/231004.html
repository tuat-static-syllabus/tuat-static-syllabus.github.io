Above all, secondary lithium batteries based on polymer electrolytes have the capabilities of outstanding performance in terms of easy processibility, mechanical stability, reliability and safety (non flammability and leakage).\nSolid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are new electrolyte materials which consist of salt (ion source) and polar polymer such as polyether. In this lecture, you review the basics of polymer materials science learned in the undergraduate lectures. The lecture focuses on SPEs and proceeds fundamentals of history, structures/species, industrial needs and applications. You learn the mechanism of dissociation of salts, diffusion phenomenon, measurement techniques and recent research on SPEs.","expected_learning":"You can understand the basis of SPEs, especially material types, configurations for the energy storage device such as a lithium ion secondary battery and the principle of operation.","course_schedule":"Part 0: Class guidance\nPart 1: The historical background, type and structure of SPEs\nPart 2: What is electrolyte? ~to understand why salts are soluble in water~\nPart 3: Ionic dissociation and ion transport mechanism in polymer (in polyether)\nPart 4: Phase diagram and crystallization of SPEs\nPart 5: Measurement techniques of ionic conductivity, ion-conductive characteristics\nPart 6: Application of SPEs 1\nPart 7: Application of SPEs 2","prerequisites":"Physical Chemistry, Polymer Science","texts_and_materials":"Printed papers are distributed in the class and unnecessary to buy textbooks","assessment":"The grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, reports, and online tests. Standard study time set by our university is required to get the grade. Grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.","message_from_instructor":"The SPEs have already used for batteries of laptop computers as in the gel state. From the viewpoint of electrical properties of polymer, there are unexpectedly many products applying piezoelectric and conductive polymers. Please try to learn hard to understand electric properties of polymer.","course_keywords":"Polymer electrolyte, Ionic conductivity, Dissociation, Mobility, Polyether, Li-ion secondary battery","office_hours":"Anytime in the first floor of Room 121 of Building No. 4","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/27/2023 2:42:13 PM","name":{"id":769,"ja":"反応工学および演習","en":"Reaction Engineering and Exercises"},"instructor":{"id":312,"ja":"加用 千裕","en":"KAYO Chihiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":17,"min":4,"max":5},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","category":"interdisciplinary exchange courses","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Institute of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Thu.2","references":"Refer to the books on polymers (such as Fiona M.
