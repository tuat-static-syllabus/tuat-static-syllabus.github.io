Based on their environmental responses, sustainable technologies for plant production will be discussed. In addition, this course introduces phenotypic plasticity produced by the interaction of genes and environments, and potential technologies controlling the plasticity for sustainable management of pest organisms.\n\nThe first lecture will be conducted online with Zoom. If the number of participants is less than the examination capacity (39) in the classroom (BASE Lecture Room I), the second and subsequent lectures will be conducted in a hybrid style (face-to-face + Zoom). On the other hand, if the number of participants is larger than the examination capacity, the second and subsequent sessions will also be conducted online with Zoom. However, these schedules are subject to change depending on the situation of COVID, and the Zoom address, etc. will be announced via Google Classroom (code: xu6eeci).","expected_learning":"To understand physiological functions of plants and physical environments for plant production.\nTo understand fundamental molecular mechanisms in environmental responses of animals.","course_schedule":"1) Guidance\n2) The hierarchy of life\n3) Physical quantities\n4) Plant responses to light\n5) Plant responses to CO2\n6) Plant responses to humidity\n7) Insect physiology\n8) Summary\nExam","prerequisites":"In addition to 15 hours in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and review the classes by referring to handouts and reference books in accordance with the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided for each class.","assessment":"Exam or report, 100%","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"environments, vertical farming, eco-evo-devo","office_hours":"weekdays 9am to 5pm","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/3/2023 12:26:28 PM","name":{"id":788,"ja":"構造材料評価法","en":"Structural Materials Evaluation"},"instructor":{"id":664,"ja":"上野 智雄, 涌井 伸二","en":"UENO Tomo, WAKUI Shinji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":2,"min":1,"max":2},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","category":"interdisciplinary exchange courses","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Institute of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Thu.2","references":"Gilbert S.F. and Epel D.
