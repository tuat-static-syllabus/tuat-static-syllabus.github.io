Learn the knowledge and research methods in the area of expertise that you are aiming for, and set a theme that will open up the era. With the aim of solving the problem, the knowledge and research techniques to be learned are further discussed. Through trial and error in these areas, the aim is to arrive at the most appropriate theme and approach to it, and to reach the stage where it can be presented at academic conferences.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Evaluate comprehensively the amount of trial and error, the amount of knowledge and skills acquired, and the results of academic presentations and journal submissions.","message_from_instructor":"In the first two years, research guidance A tends to be delayed in comparison with the research of other majors because there are research guidance B and C, and also because various training courses are taken.
