The objective of this course is to learn fundamental concepts of forest soils and their relationships to forest communities and forest ecosystems. And then this is to develop an understanding of the biogeochemical and physical properties of forest soils in relation to forest environment and forest management practices.\nStudents will learn forest soil forming process and classification, physicochemical and biological properties of soil, and their research methods. And then you will learn organic matter decomposition, stream water quality, and nutrients uptake of trees.","expected_learning":"Students need to gain knowledge of forest soil properties and research methods. And you need to gain ability to assess forest soil and site quality.","course_schedule":"1. Introduction: forest environment and soil\n2. Forest soil formation 1: influence of environments on soil forming\n3. Forest soil formation 2: topography and forest soil\n4. Forest soil formation 3: climatic index and zonal soil\n5. Soil classification 1: soil groups and soil type of Japan\n6. Soil classification 2: soil profile and research methods\n7. Report discussion: characteristics of forest soil in Japan\n8. Forest soil physiology 1: three phases of soil, soil particle etc.\n9. Forest soil physiology 2: soil water, soil gus etc.\n10. Forest soil chemistry 1: soil acidity, soil colloid etc.\n11. Forest soil chemistry 2: soil water quality, site environment etc.\n12. Soil organism: soil fauna, soil microbe, mycorrhiza, root nodule etc.\n13. Nutrients uptake: relationships to forest communities and soil\n14. Organic matter decomposition: relationships to nutrients dynamics in forest soil\n15. Stream water quality: biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling","prerequisites":"Associated classes: Forest Ecology, Silviculture, Practice on Silviculture, Experiments and Practice on Forest Soil\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below. I assign preparations for lessons every class to develop an understanding of topics of our course. The quizzes will be given in each class.
