Perform the visit of laboratories, the facilities of each education research field.","expected_learning":"You can learn the technique to use light microscopy, basic experiment about the biology including the dissection safely and exactly. You can learn how to wright scientific reports, a method of the sketching, basics of analyzing the experimental data.\n\norresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1. The first guidance, how to write report, how manage the data\nLearn about how to write reports, understand the characteristic of data to handle in a veterinary medicine.\n\n2. The expression method of the data\nLearn about basic statistics: Using real data, experience the basics of data expression with figures and the tables.\n\n3. Learn about the form of the cranial bones of the wild animal, the nature and distinction of the age, growth. Perform cranial bones sketching, the measurement of the lower jaw and age assessment using the cranial bones of the wild boar.\n\n4. Learn about quail embryo. Cut the quail egg of the age open in every day and observe a blastogenic state and sketch it.\n\n5. Learn about the outside form of the surf fish, a back place reaction, the change of the chromatophore. Observe the difference in the form of the chromatophore of the scale by the difference in color in background and sketch it. Observe the change of the melanophore by dropping adrenalin and sketch it.\n\n6. The dissection of the vertebrate (fish). Learn about the internal form of the surf fish, the structure of the body. Dissect a surf fish and observe an internal form and sketch it. Observe it about the parasitic worm (when exist).\n\n7. The dissection of the invertebrate (crawfish). Learn about difference between vertebrate and structure of the body of the invertebrate. Observe the outside form of the crawfish and sketch it. Perform dissection and observe internal forms and sketch them.\n\n8. Tracking wild animals: install a trap camera and chase the action of the wild animal.\n\n9. The eating habit analysis: Clarify the eating habit of the wild animal by feces analysis.\n10. The basic statistical analysis: examine data provided.\n\n11-14. Vising laboratories\nVisiting laboratories of the department of veterinary medicine including related facilities (five groups visit 5 laboratory. 30 minutes per group a day).\n\n15. Summary\nReview reports submitted so far and discuss refinements. Explain what kind of training you experienced and will give a guidance in future.","prerequisites":"In completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Download manuals and documents from　Google Classroom.","assessment":"evaluate the completeness of eports.","message_from_instructor":"As a university student, to be full of curiosity and to acquire a manner to learn by oneself.
