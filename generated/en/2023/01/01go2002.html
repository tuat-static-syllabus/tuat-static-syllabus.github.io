The environment in each of earth subsystems such as atmosphere, pedosphere (geosphere) and hydrosphere are lectured, including their formation, functions and histories. Students learn basic topics of agricultural and environmental sciences from the views of chemistry and physics and agriculture.\n\nThis course, \"Environmental Geoscience\", give lectures on current environment of each of earth subsystems including geochemical cycles, while the other course \"Geoscience\" addresses broad spatial scales such as inner earth and the universe in broad time scales such as the evolution of the universe and the earth.","expected_learning":"Students who successfully completed the course of this lecture will be able to explain and consider the followings in the earth subsystems giving concrete examples together with abstract and comprehensive concepts.\n1) components\n2) structure\n3) function\n4) history\n5) future\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1) \"Guidance, composition of the global environment, water cycle and surface water\" (by Shiraki)\nI) Global water cycle, II) Distribution of global precipitation, III) Precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil water storage, IV) Water balance in catchment area, V) Hydrograph, VI) Groundwater: Recharge, runoff, groundwater use and water level\n\n2) “Meteorology and Global Climate (Heat Balance / Atmospheric Circulation)” (by Shiraki)\nI) high pressure, low pressure, front, II) adiabatic expansion, adiabatic compression, cloud formation, condensation nucleus, III) typhoon, torrential rain, tornado, lightning, IV) Radiation equilibrium temperature, albedo, sensible heat, latent heat, V) Greenhouse effect, Earth energy balance, VI) Climate zone, monsoon\n\n3) \"Topography and erosion, renewal of surface material, disaster\" (by Shiraki)\nI) Landform, II) Erosion and sedimentation, III) World rivers, IV) Water and wind erosion, Loess, V) Flood, VI) Denudation, Renewal of surface materials, VII) Landslide landform generation and natural disasters\n\n4) Soil and soil forming processes (by Hashimoto)\nI）Elemental cycle in soils，II）Soil formation and reactions, III）Soils and sediments\n\n5): Soil -
