The important things in surgery is to determine whether the disease is amenable to surgery and to select the best surgical method for the disease. Therefore, this lecture focuses on the understanding of the pathogenesis of each disease, the determination of surgical indications, the selection of surgical procedures, and postoperative management. Surgical procedures require knowledge and skills in a wide range of disciplines. This course aims to provide students with knowledge and skills in surgery that encompass all of these areas.\n\nThis course, together with the Practical Small Animal Surgery Basic Course, conforms to the \"Practical Small Animal Surgery\" of the Model Core Curriculum for Veterinary Education established by the Japanese Association of Establishments Veterinary Education (JAEVE). In addition, this course is taught by faculty members with practical experience. The faculty members in charge of this course are directly involved in veterinary clinical practice at the Veterinary Medical Center(TUAT-AMC) attached to the Faculty of Agriculture of this university. By giving lectures with examples of clinical cases in TUAT-AMC as necessary, students can gain knowledge about actual clinical situations and responses.","expected_learning":"Perform basic surgical techniques such as incision, hemostasis, ligation, and suturing.\nPerform anesthesia and perioperative management of animals.\nDescribe surgical techniques for various diseases of the body surface, digestive system and abdominal cavity, respiratory system and thoracic cavity, nervous system, locomotor system, and genitourinary system.\nDescribe the advantages and disadvantages of each of the above surgical procedures.","course_schedule":"Since this course is conducted in conjunction with \"Soft Tissue Surgery,\" which is conducted concurrently, the content of practical training may be changed depending on the progress of the course.
