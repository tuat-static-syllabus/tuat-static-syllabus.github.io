For example, phase transition and chemical reactions occur along processes decreasing these thermodynamic potential functions. Moreover, colligative properties of solution, such as well-known melting point depression and boiling point elevation phenomena, can be quantitatively explained by using the thermodynamic potentials. This course is the most primitive fundamental of all the courses of environmental and natural resource since.","expected_learning":"Students learn the fact that all the physicochemical processes are controlled by thermodynamic potential functions.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy: See the curriculum maps. https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1) Review of the definitions of thermodynamics potentials\n2) Definition of chemical potential\n3) Physical meanings of chemical potential\n4) Determination of thermodynamical equilibrium\n5) Phase transition\n6) Phase diagram and phase boundaries\n7) Clapeyron equation\n8) Phase equilibrium of multi-component systems (Gibbs' phase rule)\n9) application of Gibbs' phase rule\n10) thermodynamics of mixing\n11) Chemical potential of solution\n12) Colligative properties of solution 1 (boiling point elevation and melting point depression)\n13) Colligative properties of solution 2 (osmotic pressure)\n14) Thermodynamics of chemical reactions\n15) Examination\n","prerequisites":"In addition to the 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Homework (60%) and an examination (40%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Office hours will be announced in the first class.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/30/2023 9:13:21 AM","name":{"id":232,"ja":"環境資源熱力学","en":"Thermodynamics for Environmental Science"},"instructor":{"id":196,"ja":"四方 俊幸","en":"SHIKATA Toshiyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Tue.3","references":""}}
