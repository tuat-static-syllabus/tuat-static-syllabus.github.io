As a culture to build the base for agricultural and environmental sciences, this course lectures basic scientific knowledge on geosciences, taking a flame work of earth and planetary sciences that has made progress recently.\n\nThis course 'Geoscience' addresses spatial scales such as inner earth and the universe, and time scales such as the evolution of the universe and the earth. This course aims to understand the basic concept on the universe and our planet and the scientific approaches. On the other hand, the other course, \"Environmental Geoscience\", give lectures on current\nenvironment and geochemical cycles of each earth subsystem such as atmosphere, geosphere and hydrosphere.\n\n\nThis course is essential to the students who are going to get a license of 'Science' for junior high school and high school.\n\n","expected_learning":"To be able to explain properly the meaning of basic terms on geosciences.\nTo understand the important concepts related to geoscientific phenomena and be able to explain them.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"Kaoru Suzuki:\n1) （10/5)　Volcanoes, igneous rock\n2) （10/12)　Orogenic movement, metamorphism, metamorphic rock\n3) （10/19)　Action of water and topography, sedimentary rock, Stratum\n4) （10/26)　The Quaternary period in Japan\n\nYu Umezawa:\n5) （11/2)　Energy resources\n6) （11/9)　Coevolution of the Earth and Life (Birth of the Earth and Life, Changes in the Atmosphere, Snowball Earth, etc.)\n7) （11/16)　Coevolution of the Earth and Life (Cambrian Explosion, Formation of Ozone Layer, Continental drift, etc.)\n8) （11/23)　Coevolution of the Earth and life (Mass extinction of life, climate change causing glacial and interglacial periods, etc.)\n9) （11/30)　Spare day for review\n\nTakashi Hamana:\n10) （12/14)　Overview of visible celestial objects\n11) （12/21)　Planetary motion and gravity\n12) （1/11)　Structure and energy source of the sun\n13) （1/18)　Nucleosynthesis in the universe\n14) （1/25)　Formation of solar system planets, and exoplanets\n\n15) Summary\n（2/1) Term exam","prerequisites":"It is desirable for students who are going to attend \"Geoscience Experiment\" and \"Environmental Geoscience\" to learn this course.\n\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for\nand revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and\nusing the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.\n","texts_and_materials":"Supplementary documents will be distributed accordingly during the class.","assessment":"Term exam\n\nProper attendance in class is a requirement for eligibility to take the exam.\n\nQuestions are designed to assess the understanding of and the ability to explain the topics dealt\nin the lectures.\n\nThe grade distribution of the previous year is following.\n（2021year S: 41.6%, A: 31.2%, B: 18.8%, C: 6.0%, D: 2.4%)\n*The above data does not include students who did not take the final exam.","message_from_instructor":"The content of the class is diverse, but students are required not to be too much obsessed in the details, and rather try to understand the big framework, such as concepts and principles, how they are established, and so on.\n","course_keywords":"History and formation of the earth，Origin and formation process of earth surface materials, Earth in the Universe","office_hours":"Mail to: Umezawa (umezawa@me.tuat.ac.jp), Suzuki (kaoru@cc.tuat.ac.jp), Hamana (hamana.tk@nao.ac.jp)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/8/2023 5:47:29 PM","name":{"id":299,"ja":"地学","en":"Geoscience"},"instructor":{"id":2515,"ja":"梅澤 有, 鈴木 馨, 濵名 崇","en":"UMEZAWA Yu, SUZUKI Kaoru, HAMANA Takashi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"Building2 324A","day_period":"Thu.1","references":"『基礎地球科学』 西村他著，朝倉書店"}}
