In this lecture course, students gain knowledge on research contributing to achieving SDGs and engage in group work with fellow students from different disciplines to propose a way in which how they would integrate their expertise and approach the problems for SDGs. This course aims to encourage students to recognize the significance of interdisciplinary research, the diversity of research development, and generation of novel findings. Additionally, students are encouraged to think what sort of skills are required in tackling such problems and conducting interdisciplinary research, and find motivation for their studies and research activities in the third and fourth years.\n\nThis lecture course is included in Global Integrated Studies of the Liberal Arts and Fundamental Studies, and offers students opportunities to apply and integrate their knowledge and skills obtained in the foundation courses during their first two years in the university.\n","expected_learning":"1. Students are expected to learn the importance of interdisciplinary research and to be able to describe specifically what techniques and knowledge from different disciplines are integrated.\n\n2. Through the activity to make a research proposal with students from different faculties, students are expected to become able to explain specific contributions from different disciplines and the novel effect produced by the integration.\n\nCompetency development:\nLeadership and coordination, Innovative thinking, Communication, Mission-oriented research and problem solving\n","course_schedule":"1: Introductory class. The objectives and outline of the course are described, as well as the importance of interdisciplinary research and skills required.\n2: Research seminar by Prof Taiichiro Ookawa, from the Faculty of Agriculture, TUAT.\n3: Research seminar by Prof Akihiko Terada, from the Faculty of Engineering, TUAT.\n4: Research seminar by Prof Shinsuke Koike from the Institute of Global Innovation Research, TUAT.\n5: Learning outcomes are discussed in groups.\n6: Brainstorming to generate ideas on interdisciplinary research which may be useful in tacking SDGs.\n7: Groupwork to prepare own proposals for interdisciplinary research which may be useful in tacking SDGs.\n8: Presentations.\n\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 16 hours in the class and the activities required to make preparations for group presentations, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"?
