In addition to gross observation of the lesions of organs and tissues of industrial animals detected at a meat inspection laboratory, learn practically how to conduct autopsy and observe pathological changes appeared in various organs throughout the body. By means of the practice in gross and histological pathology, cultivate comprehensive diagnostic ability of diseases. This subject is a course subject by a teacher with practical experience. In charge of toxicology, the instructor has experience in pathological diagnosis in toxicity tests, and gives lectures with examples of lesions in class.","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nPlease refer to the curriculum map of our university HP (3 policies).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\n1. Understand the procedure of necropsy of experimental animals, observation method of macroscopic lesions, and how to take findings.\n2. Understand the outline of tissue preparation for histopathology such as fixation and trimming of animal tissues, and sectioning and staining of embedded tissue specimens.\n3. Understand how to observe the tissue slides for histopathological assessment using a microscopy.\n4. Understand the morphological changes of the lesions in the circulatory system.\n5. Understand the morphological changes of the lesions in the hematopoietic system.\n6. Understand the morphological changes of the lesions in the respiratory system.\n7. Understand the morphological changes of the lesions in the digestive system.","course_schedule":"Practice in Pathology I is held during the 3rd semester of the 3rd grade, and carries out the following exercises.\n\n1. Description of how to prepare pathological specimens and how to use a microscope; Practice of observation of pathological tissue specimens of diseased animals: cardiovascular system lesions #1.\n2. Observation practice of histopathological specimens of diseased animals: cardiovascular system lesions #2.\n3. Observation practice of histopathological specimens of diseased animals: cardiovascular system lesions #3, hematopoietic system lesions #1.\n4. Autopsy practice using normal rats.\n5. Observation practice of histopathological specimens of diseased animals: hematopoietic system lesions #2.\n6. Observation practice of histopathological specimens of diseased animals: hematopoietic system lesions #3.\n7. Observation training of histopathological specimens of diseased animals: Experimentally induced toxic lesions in rodents.\n8. Practice observation of pathological tissue specimens of diseased animals: hematopoietic system lesions #4, respiratory system lesions #1.\n9. Histopathology sample preparation practice: Excision of tissue pieces, paraffin embedding, slicing of tissue sections, and HE staining preparation.\n10. Observation practice of histopathological specimens of diseased animals: respiratory system lesions #2.\n11. Observation practice of histopathological specimens of diseased animals: respiratory system lesions #3, digestive system lesions #1.\n12. Observation practice of histopathological specimens of diseased animals: digestive system lesions #2.\n13. Observation practice of histopathological specimens of diseased animals: digestive system lesions #3.\n14. Practice of observing pathological tissue specimens of diseased animals: digestive system lesions #4.\n15. Summary of the content of the 1st to 14th exercises, section diagnosis test.","prerequisites":"The students should have taken courses on veterinary anatomy, veterinary histology, veterinary physiology, veterinary biochemistry, veterinary microbiology, immunology, and general veterinary pathology. In addition to the practice time, refer to the training materials, textbooks, reference books, etc. that have been distributed, and do post-study to complete the sketch.","texts_and_materials":"Use Animal Special Pathology (3rd Edition), Color Atlas of Animal Pathology (2nd Edition), both being edited by Japanese Society of Veterinary Pathology as textbooks. Powerpoint documents will also be handed out.","assessment":"More than 80% of the attendance to the practice of the 1st and 14th times in each semester is prerequisite for the assessment. Degree of activeness in the class, submission of reports (sketch), and tests for histopathological diagnosis using projected pathological images will constitute 20%, 40%, and 40% of your final grade, respectively.\nThe percentage of points, evaluation points, and timing of evaluation are as follows.\nNormal score 20%: Evaluation of attitude and aggressiveness toward practical training.\nReport (sketch) 40%: Evaluation of the level of understanding of pathological changes based on the report (sketch) submitted after the 15th practical session.\nPathological diagnosis examination 40%: In the 15th lecture, a pathological diagnosis examination will be conducted by projecting images of lesions on the cases practiced from the 1st to the 14th lecture, to comprehensively evaluate whether pathological findings and pathological diagnosis can be correctly derived.","message_from_instructor":"Students should have studied well the contents in anatomy and histology classes at the 2nd grade, because knowledge of these courses is indispensable to them for conducting pathological diagnosis. They will use a textbook of Systemic Animal Pathology and also Color Atlas of Animal Pathology, both of which cover the contents in on-the-job pathological program.","course_keywords":"Pathological anatomy, microscopical assessment, histopathological diagnosis","office_hours":"13:00〜18:30.
