Learn about human activities and technologies that are sustainable and in harmony with the environment. Spaces including forests, rural areas, rural areas, cities, etc. are defined as one continuous \"region\", and animals and plants live according to the natural environment spread there, humans perform production activities, and form society. The purpose is to explain the mechanism of the ecosystem including this human society, and to understand the outline of the way of human activity and technology that is sustainable and in harmony with the environment.\n【Position in the curriculum】\nThis is an introductory class to understand the system of specialized subjects in the Department of Regional Ecosystems.
