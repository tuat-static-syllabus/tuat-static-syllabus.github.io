It is an essential subject in agricultural environmental engineering program to learn the principle for the relation between force and deformation.\n【Outline】 Learn mainly about modeling of elements with external force, calculation of internal force, solution of deflection equation. For training calculating skill, home works will be given in each lecture. These problems are chosen to learn the important points in each lecture.","expected_learning":"Understanding the deflection equation as a static problem, wearing a solution as a boundary value problem, and solving a design task.\nObtain bending moment diagrams, shear force diagrams in that process.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1. Introduction\n2. Modeling external force\n3. stress and strain\n4. Balance of force, calculation of support reaction force\n5. Bending 1 (bending moment and the principle of shear force)\n6.
