Several experiments on cardiac muscle which spontaneously beats will be also provided.\n⑥Culture technique for microorganisms and fungi: As a basic experimental technique for microbiology,students will learn culture method of microorganisms and fungi. Prepare culture media, and culture these microorganisms in sterile condition by pure culture method, slide culture method plate culture method. Students will also learn gram staining.\n\n","prerequisites":"In addition to the lectures in the class, you are recommended to prepare and review the class using the standard amount of time as specified by the university for each class.","texts_and_materials":"Text will be provided in class.
