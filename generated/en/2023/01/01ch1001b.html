The course intends to give a basic knowledge of physical chemistry. The subject provides a liberal arts education in the curriculum, and is also important for the understanding of agricultural sciences.\n[Overview] The lecture provides basic concepts of quantum chemistry, chemical bonding, chemical reaction kinetics, acid and base, enthalpy, entropy, etc., from the view point of physical chemistry.","expected_learning":"- Understanding basics of quantum chemistry, and understanding chemical bonding from the view point of quantum chemistry.\n- Understanding reaction kinetics and acid/base, which are important concepts in chemical reaction.\n- Understanding enthalpy and entropy, both of which are important concepts in thermodynamics.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: (A)\nPlease refer to the curriculum map at the following URL:\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/.","course_schedule":"Omnibus / three instructors\n\nQuantum chemistry basics and chemical bonding. Instructor: Hiroshi Kawaide\n1. Quantum chemistry basics (first half of chapter 7 in the textbook)\n2. Electronic configuration and atomic orbitals (last half of chapter 7 in the textbook)\n3. Molecular structure (first half of chapter 9 in the textbook)\n4. Molecular orbitals (last half of chapter 9 in the textbook)\n5. Review and examination\n\nChemical reaction kinetics and acid/base. Instructor: not determined\n6. Chemical reaction rates (first half of chapter 13 in the textbook)\n7. Mechanism of chemical reaction (last half of chapter 13 in the textbook)\n8. Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases (first half of chapter 15 in the textbook)\n9. Lewis acids and bases (last half of chapter 15 in the textbook)\n10. Review and examination\n\nThermodynamics basics.

Review and examination","prerequisites":"This lecture is only for students in the department of Applied Biological Science (Bn). Please be careful not to confuse with this lecture with lectures of the same name for students belong to different departments.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to 30 hours of the attendance of lecture.","texts_and_materials":"“Chemistry: The Molecular Nature of Matter”, Brady, Hyslop, and Jespersen, Japanese version, Tokyo Kagaku Dojin\nLearning time for preparation / review: according to the standard hours at our university","assessment":"Performance in lecture (10% total), examination (90% total)","message_from_instructor":"Now it is the time to forget about your way of studying in your high school chemistry class, that is the way to memorize everything unsystematically and untheoretically. Students are expected to think systematically and theoretically about the structure and the state of chemical materials.","course_keywords":"Quantum chemistry, chemical bonding, chemical kinetics, acid/base, enthalpy, entropy","office_hours":"Questions can be asked after class, or please request an appointment by email.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/24/2023 3:54:36 PM","name":{"id":129,"ja":"学外実習(研究所)","en":"Extramural practice (at Laboratory )"},"instructor":{"id":143,"ja":"平岡 毅","en":"HIRAOKA Tsuyoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Organization for the Advancement of Education and Global Learning","office":"","day_period":"undefined.1","references":"Information of references will be provided in the lecture if needed."}}
