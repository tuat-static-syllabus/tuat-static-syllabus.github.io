Students will experience different styles of lectures and classes depending on the contents. It consists of two parts.\n\nPart I : Common Introductory Program\nIn this program that is common to all first-year students, students will learn about our university and think how they would pursue their academic life here. The university history and TUAT principals are described as well as our research activities, with the aim of encouraging students to engage in university study and to understanding the importance of designing their individual university life.\n\nPart II : Faculty-Specific Program\nTheme: Food chemicals and their risk assessment\nThere are many kinds of chemicals, such as food additives, pesticides and animal medicinal drugs, contained in daily ingested foods. In this class, we learn what kind of toxic property is harmful to human health by collecting necessary information for analysis with regard to long-term exposure effects including carcinogenicity in experimental animals and humans. During the course of investigation, we learn the relationship between the concept of risk assessment and risk management against hazardous factors.\n\nThere are many questions that are necessary to be solved before appropriate understanding of risk of food chemicals, such as food additives, pesticides and animal medicinal drugs. Following are the examples of questions.\n\n1. What kinds of animal studies are conducted for evaluation of human risk of food chemicals? How these chemicals are approved for use with the study data set obtained?\n2. How about the use of chemicals that have previously been reported to show strong or irreversible toxicity? Are these chemicals banned or still used until now?\n3. How about the evaluation scheme of food chemicals in foreign countries and international agencies.\n4. How about the possibility for cancer risk of commercially used pesticides and food additives that have previously proved to show carcinogenicity?\n5. Are chemically induced cancers genetically inheritable?\n\nIn this class, students are asked to collect toxicity information that can be used for assessment of human health risk of theme chemicals. By means of oral presentation and group discussion, appropriate answers to solve the questions will be obtained. Moreover, students will experience the methodologies to make histological tissue specimens necessary for histopathological assessment that are used for risk evaluation of chemicals.","expected_learning":"To understand the autonomous learning in the University, and be able to design individual's academic life at University from broad perspectives.\n2) Acquire the ability to investigate voluntarily issues and solve problems by drafting a human health impact assessment plan for the theme chemical.\n1. Understand the concept and methodology for risk assessment of representative toxic substances on human health.\n2. Understand the risk assessment of toxicants in Japan, foreign countries and international agencies.\n3. Investigate comprehensively the results of voluntary surveys of theme chemicals.\n4. Learn good presentation skill.\n\nCompetency Development：\nInitiative and Autonomy, Leadership and Facilitation, Knowledge Creation, Presentation Skills, Mission-Oriented Research and Problem Solving, Academic Ethics","course_schedule":"Part I: Common Introductory Program\n1.

Presentation 3-2 (second group), summary.","prerequisites":"Part I: In addition to 10 hours you spend in the class, you are recommended to review the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University for each class, to plan out the courses to take and design how you would pursue your academic activities ahead.\n\nPart II: It is necessary to have an ability to make presentation file using Power Point Software. There is nothing necessary, if students have knowledge of biology class at the level of senior high school. In addition to the 10 times of class time, refer to the distributed lecture materials and the materials you searched uniquely, construct a presentation plan, and create a presentation material.","texts_and_materials":"Part I: Handouts and exercise materials are provided during the class.\n\nPart II: Nothing is necessary, because all the published data are obtained from internet service or e-journal search in the library.","assessment":"Part I (25%)： Marks are given based on worksheets collected at the end of each class.\nPart II (75%)：More than 80% of the attendance to the class is prerequisite for the assessment.
