In this course, we will learn about differentiation and integration of multivariable functions, such as partial differentiations, criteria of local maxima and minima, double integrations, volumes of solids and areas of surfaces.\n\nThis course is taught by a part-time lecturer. Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.","expected_learning":"・To be able to understand and calculate limit, partial differential, total differentiation and double integrals of a two-variable function.\n・To be able to calculate extreme values of a two-variable function.\n・To be able to calculate volumes of solids and areas of surfaces.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps","course_schedule":"1.
