Participants evaluate biodiversity of the forest by identifying invertebrates and fungi.\nArboriculture (tree doctor) assessment is classified into two diagnoses: firstly, visual tree assessment and secondary diagnosis by using devices. The participants learn about comprehensive visual tree assessment, the principles of the devices, and how to use them. Based on these lecture, they will get skills to make arboricultural reports. They also observe field sites to examine the methods of contraction and thinking about tree treatments.\n\nThe practice of this course has the firsthand experiences on tree treatments and landscape architecture managements in local government etc. In this course, students will be trained in the techniques for tree treatments and landscape architecture.","expected_learning":"Criterion for achievement: Obtain the basic skills for making academic reports, by understanding the broad range of practices related to forest protection and tree health. All participants need to attend all lectures.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/?\n","course_schedule":"Forest soundness\n1. Observe animal tracking such as footprints and feeding damages, and of protective methods against tree damages in forests.\n2. Examine the wildlife management and prevention of animal damages, by investigating bark-stripping by bears.\n3. Investigate Japanese oak wilt in the field.\n4. Observe the diseases of various tree species: symptoms and sign of diseases.\n\nTree diagnosis and tree care treatments\n5. The concept and method of visual tree assessment, and method for environmental conditions.\n6. Method for diagnostic work-up by using machines (mainly diagnosis for decay): diagnosis of tree trunks, testing with the resistograph system, ultrasonic velocity measurement of wood, Gamma-ray CT method, trunk temperature measurement, and Shigometer measuring.\n7. Soil research: estimation of soil profile by penetration test and permeability test.\n8 & 9. Diagnosis and treatment of urban street trees and old trees as natural monuments (1. observation and 2. making diagnosis and tree care reports): Make a tree architectural diagram and crown projection diagram, and express the problems of the parts of the trees. Know the environmental conditions of the trees and make the secondary diagnosis of tree health and treatment, and then, make the reports of visual tree assessment.\n\nAll participants learn about No.1 to No.9 in August, 2021 (several days). As the summary of No.8 and No.9, they listen to the explanation of the management of cultural assets of each tree around Ueno and the management of urban street trees at Yotsuya, Akasaka, Aoyama, and Harajuku on August, 2021 (1 day). Based on the observations, each participant makes tree diagnostic reports.","prerequisites":"We will hold a pre-explanation meeting at 420 room in Building 1 from 12:30 on April, 2021 (all absentees cannot take this course). We will proceed this practice based on the premise that all participants take some classes associated with forest ecology, especially, Practice on Silviculture and Practice on Forest Dendrology.\n* No one take this course unless paying food expenses at Room 401 in Building 1 by July 2021.\n** You cannot take this course if you take another class overlapping with this one. And we only evaluate the scores of a person who attend all days and submit all reports.\n\nIn completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"We provide a handout accordingly.","assessment":"Evaluation method of a grade:\nThis course has many reports due to an intensive practice. Please submit quickly them with concise description. Because the reports need the data obtained by all participants, they should share the integrated data immediately.\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Forest soundness, Wildlife management, Biodiversity, Tree diagnosis, Hazard tree assessment, Tree treatment","office_hours":"We welcome your questions about the topics of this course. Please make an appointment by email before visiting our rooms: Yoshida (yoshitom@cc.tuat.ac.jp) about tree health and forest insects, and Koike (koikes@cc.tuat.ac.jp) about forest animals and birds.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/23/2023 11:35:44 PM","name":{"id":236,"ja":"資源材料力学","en":"Material Mechanics for Natural Resources"},"instructor":{"id":226,"ja":"佐藤 敬一, 船田 良, 吉田 誠, 半 智史","en":"SATO Keiichi, FUNADA Ryo, YOSHIDA Makoto, NAKABA Satoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":14,"min":3},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"International Center","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Please see the syllabus in Japanese version."}}
