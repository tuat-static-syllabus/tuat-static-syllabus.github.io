Chromatography: (1) The principle and characteristics of separation of GC, HPLC, etc. for purifying and isolating organic compounds will be described.\n3. Ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrum: The theory and characteristic absorption of this method that can obtain information on a conjugated system will be described.\n4. Infrared (RI) absorption spectrum: The measurement method of the present method for examining the functional group of a compound, and the features of its structure and spectrum will be described.\n5. Mass (MS) spectrum: The principle of measurement and the apparatus, the method of analyzing spectra, various measuring methods, and the like of the present method for providing information on the molecular weight and partial structure of a compound will be described.\n6. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrum-1 (Overview, 1H NMR): Measurement of 1H (proton) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance methods that give information on the bonding state between hydrogen atoms and carbon atoms that constitute the skeleton of an organic compound. The principle, spectrum analysis method, various measurement methods, and information obtained thereby will be described. Since a large amount of information can be obtained in instrumental analysis and is the main method for determining the structure by instrumental analysis, a sufficient time will be described.\n7.
