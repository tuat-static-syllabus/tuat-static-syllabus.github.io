Originally, organic chemistry began with chemical nature of substances, but now it is extremely important in the field of agricultural and pharmaceutical sciences. At the Department of Applied Bioscience, you can study the basics of organic chemistry over a year and a half. In the course of \"Organic Chemistry I\", you will learn the nature and chemical reactions of alkanes, alkenes and alkynes.","expected_learning":"Students who take this course are expected to understand the principals in organic chemistry including the following points:\n\n1) Structures of molecules: atoms, molecular orbits, hybrid orbits and covalent bonds.\n2) Influence of the electronegativity on covalent bonds.\n3) Chemical reaction and electron transfer.\n4) Basic rules on organic compounds: nomenclature of organic compounds and name of functional groups.\n5) Three-dimensional structure of organic compounds.\n6) Transition state and reaction energy.\n\nViewpoint of diploma policy in this subject:\nYou will learn a wide range of knowledge and culture that will serve as the foundation for addressing applied biological sciences and related domain issues, and acquire flexible thinking skills.\nIn order to elucidate the biological phenomena and interactions among living organisms and their coexistence patterns, and to contribute to the sustainable development of humanity, the systematics of specialized fields from the basics to the leading edge of applied biological sciences and related sciences learn.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps. (URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )","course_schedule":"# 1 \"Significance of learning organic chemistry\": After commentary on textbooks and reference books used in this lecture, we will explain the role of organic chemistry in agriculture and the significance of learning.\n# 2 \"Characteristics of carbon atoms as the leading chemist of organic chemistry\": The special properties of carbon atoms played out among the main elements appearing in organic chemistry are explained. To understand this, we learn the concept of atomic structure, orbit, electronic arrangement.\n# 3 \"Hybrid orbit and chemical bond\": Learn about the concept of hybrid orbital and the characteristics of chemical bond centered on carbon.\n# 4 \"Polarity and acid-base\": Learn the relationship between the electron distribution in the molecule of the organic compound, the electron density and the characteristics of the molecule.\n# 5 \"Branched alkane nomenclature and functional groups\": Learn the basics of organic compound nomenclature, name of alkyl group, conformation and configuration.\n# 6 \"Representation of chemical structure and structure of cycloalkane\": To deepen the understanding of conformation and learn the structural properties of cycloalkane.\n# 7 Review and examination\n#8 \"Nomenclature and exercise of organic compounds\": Learn naming methods of organic compounds and solve exercises related to nomenclature in accordance with procedures themselves presented in textbooks.\n# 9 \"Types of organic reactions\": Learn the reaction mechanism of addition reaction, elimination reaction, substitution reaction, rearrangement reaction, along with electron transfer process.\n# 10 \"Reaction and energy diagram\": Know the meaning of the reaction energy diagram and explain the mechanism of chemical reaction progress.\n# 11 \"Reaction of alkene\": Focusing on the reactivity of alkene, we explain the development to more diverse chemical reactions.\n# 12 \"Characteristics and reaction of alkene, alkyne\": Radical polymerization, resonance and reaction analysis based on its characteristics are explained.\n# 13 \"Question and answer\": We summarize chapters 1 to 4 of textbooks and explain the viewpoint to comprehensively understand the structure and reactivity of organic compounds.\n# 14 Review and examination\n# 15 \"Summary and examination of lecture\": Explain the points of answers to the exercises on organic chemistry.\n\n","prerequisites":"This course is followed by Organic Chemistry II and then III.\nCourse conditions, related subjects (information for preparing and reviewing, required study time ) is \"based on the standard number of hours of the university\".","texts_and_materials":"J.
