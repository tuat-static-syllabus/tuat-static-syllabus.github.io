In this course, we will learn various computations based on matrices so that we can treat more abstract notions such as vector spaces at hand.\n\nThis course is taught by a part-time lecturer. Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is to be capable of performing basic operations on matrices.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"1.
