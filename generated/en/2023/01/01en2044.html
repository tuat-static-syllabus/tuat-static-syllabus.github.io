This subject deals with mechanism and function of ecosystems to understand ecosystems for environmental and natural resource science. We will lecture from the fundamental aspects of ecosystem to material cycle, biodiversity and conservation of global environment. Please check \"Classroom\" for some details.","expected_learning":"Understanding the overview of ecosystem and their functions, and anthropogenic disturbance of ecosystems for the issues of environment and natural resources.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1. A concept of global system and ecosystem\n2. Physical geography and biological geography (climate system and water cycle)\n3. History of ecology\n4. Evolution and extinction with environment changes\n5. Excursion in Fuchu campus\n6. History of terrestrial ecosystems from birth to succession, and geographical distribution of vegetation.\n7. Carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystem (mainly forest)\n8. Nitrogen cycle in terrestrial ecosystem (mainly forest)\n9. Phosphorus cycle\n10. Plant defense against herbivore\n11. Forest decline and their causes\n12. Landscape and ecosystem service\n13. Biodiversity\n14. Changes of global system (anthropogenic disturbance)\n15. Conservation of global ecosystem\n","prerequisites":"This lecture is a specialized subject.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (30 hours).","texts_and_materials":"Nothing in particular","assessment":"We will assess based on the answer to the question in the end of each lecture (30%) and the final report (70%). The points of report assessment are “understanding the task”, “logical structure” and “correct writing”. We will not give a credit when we do not confirm your attendance of lecture above 10 times.","message_from_instructor":"The stimulation of human activity after the Industrial revolution seriously affect our life through various changes in ecosystems. Although ecosystem is very complex system, many interesting and important knowledge have been obtained as a result of great efforts by forerunners. We hope you will deeply consider “our” ecosystems and learn the basis for the conservation of them through our lecture. Two staffs will lecture in this subject. Please contact us by e-mail in each.","course_keywords":"Ecosystem, material cycle, biodiversity, conservation of ecosystems","office_hours":"After second lecture on Tuesday. Question during and after the lecture is always welcome. You also can ask us via e-mail.","remarks_1":"Nothing in particular","remarks_2":"","related_url":"Nothing in particular","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/16/2023 1:57:45 PM","name":{"id":172,"ja":"生物相関学","en":"Molecular Mechanism of Bio-interaction"},"instructor":{"id":173,"ja":"福原 敏行, 金勝 一樹, 川合 伸也","en":"FUKUHARA Toshiyuki, KANEKATSU Motoki, KAWAI Shinya"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Tue.1","references":"Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology (ed. by Chapin et al.).
