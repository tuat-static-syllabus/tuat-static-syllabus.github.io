On the water cycle, river water, groundwater and lake water as components of freshwater have unique movements and circulations. Recently, the freshwater, very important resource for us, faces the problem from the aspects of both quantity and quality. Participants will learn water cycle associated with energy and material cycles on the earth's surface, and understand overall picture of the freshwater environments with comprehensions of the component characteristics.","expected_learning":"Students who successfully completed the course of this lecture, are able to explain hydrologic cycle associated with energy and material cycles on the earth's surface, and understand overall picture of the freshwater environments with comprehensions of the component characteristics.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"The lecture content will change depending on the participant’s interests, and progress of the lectures, but the following topics will be lectured.\n\n1. Introduction of \"Science on Freshwater Environment\"\n2. Freshwater in hydrologic cycle 1: Volume of freshwater\n3. Freshwater in hydrologic cycle 2: Residence time freshwater\n4. Watershed and water balances 1: Idea of watershed\n5. Watershed and water balances 2: Water balances\n6. Chemical compositions of freshwater\n7. River water 1: Outflow characteristics\n8. River water 2: Fluival geomorphology\n9. Groundwater 1: Distributions of underground water\n10. Groundwater 2: Movements of groundwater\n11. Lake water 1: Types and structures of lake\n12.
