In this lecture, we will cover both \"Chemical Thermodynamics\" and \"Introduction to Quantum Chemistry.\" By examining familiar phenomena as examples, students will gain an overview of the fundamental principles of chemical thermodynamics and quantum chemistry.","expected_learning":"【Chemical Thermodynamics】\n(1) Understand the concepts of temperature, pressure, and volume, which determine the macroscopic state of matter. (2) Comprehend the changes in the state of matter that accompany variations in temperature, pressure, and volume. (3) Grasp the ideas of entropy and free energy through the various laws of thermodynamic properties.\n【Quantum Chemistry】\n(1) Be able to explain the dual nature of waves and particles. (2) Be capable of constructing Schrodinger's wave equation. (3) Describe the electron configuration in atoms and molecules.\n","course_schedule":"The contents of each lecture are as follows:\nThe first through tenth lectures will cover \"Chemical Thermodynamics,\" and the eleventh through fourteenth lectures will cover \"Quantum Chemistry.\" In each lecture, students will be given exercises to enhance their understanding of the lecture content. A midterm report (on the first half of Chemical Thermodynamics) will be given in the 6th lecture.\n1st: Equation of state of ideal gas and kinetics of gas molecules\n2nd: Internal energy of molecules and velocity distribution of gas molecules\n3rd: First law of thermodynamics 1: Thermodynamic processes and enthalpy\n4th: First law of thermodynamics 2: Thermochemical equation\n5th: Second law of thermodynamics 1: Entropy and Carnot cycle\n6th: Second law of thermodynamics 2: Chemical equilibrium\n7th: Phase transformation of pure substances: three states and phase diagram\n8th: Phase equilibrium and free energy\n9th: Mole fraction of solution and phase equilibrium\n10th: Uniform properties and chemical potentials\n11th: Early Period Quantum Theory\n12th: Schrodinger's wave equation\n13th: Quantum theory of atoms\n14th: Quantum theory of molecules\n15th: Summary (final exam)","prerequisites":"There are no prerequisites for this course.
