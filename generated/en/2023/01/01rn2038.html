You will study how to use different characteristics such as leaf shape,\narrangement, bark texture, and habitat to identify trees and other plant species.\n\nTo expose students to morphological, ecological and phenological traits useful in field identification of woody plants.\nTo introduce some basic characteristics of forest ecosystems.\n\nLectures provide background information essential to developing identification skills and laboratory exercises provide hands-on application of identification skills and an opportunity to practice plant identification.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand classification from the birth of trees, a basic physiology of the trees and a photosynthetic process.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1.
