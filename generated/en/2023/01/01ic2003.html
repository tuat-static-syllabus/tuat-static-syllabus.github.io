Orientation and understanding of the R&D process in universities and companies\n2. Positioning of R&D in career design\n3. Strategies and tactics to generate innovation\n4. Understanding open innovation and the innovation ecosystem\n5. Innovation through agriculture-industry collaboration\n6. Current Status and Future Prospects of Open Innovation\n7. Current status of agri-bio startups in Japan and abroad\n8.

In recent years, in particular, an increasing number of \"degrowth\" companies have prioritized their essential raison d'etre over quantitative indicators of business scale and economic performance. In this context, this lecture will introduce R&D/business strategies that should be considered for a sustainable society, industry-government-academia-industry collaboration as a tactic, and the process of new business creation.\n\nSession 4: [Lecture] Understanding \"open innovation\" and \"innovation ecosystem\n　　In the R&D and innovation process, it is often said that there is a trade-off between quality and time. However, by successfully implementing open innovation and innovation ecosystems, it is possible to trade-on to implement social issues more quickly.\n\nSession 5: [Group Work] Innovation through Agricultural-Industrial Collaboration\n　　In the future, the world's population is certain to reach nearly 10 billion people by 2050, and solutions to social issues such as food, energy, and the environment that humankind faces will have to wait for no time. Here, small teams will be formed to discuss and present themes on the possibilities of collaboration between agriculture and engineering that will lead to future innovation.\n\nLecture report assignment (for lectures 1-5)　report Due date: 9/15 till 13:00\n\nSession 6: [Tour of corporate facilities and seminar by guests] Understanding the reality of open innovation\n　　Deepen understanding of the innovation ecosystem through a tour of open innovation facilities at companies, as well as through questions and discussions on open innovation mechanisms by corporate guest lecturers using the facilities.\n\nSession 7: [Guest lecture and group work] The latest status of agri-bio startups in Japan and overseas\n　　Innovation in agriculture and biotechnology is not limited to agricultural-industrial collaboration, but has expanded beyond the supply chain to the value chain in areas such as food and beverage, energy, and medicine and health. In addition, representatives of agri-startups active in Japan will be invited as guest lecturers to talk about their daily efforts and challenges toward commercialization, and deepen understanding of startups through questions and discussions.\n\nSession 8: Presentation of group work, summary\n　　The group work members in the 6th and 7th sessions will summarize and present their findings on innovation through agriculture-industry collaboration.\nFinally, a question-and-answer session will be held throughout the entire session, followed by a summary.\n\n\nAfter the second day, there will be assignment reports for the first through the fifth sessions, due by the start of the lecture on September 15.","prerequisites":"None","texts_and_materials":"No fixed textbooks, but materials prepared by the instructor will be distributed in each class.","assessment":"(1)　Grading will be based on class participation (class participation), assignment reports, etc., and credits will be awarded when the standardized learning effectiveness set by the university is recognized.\n　Grades will be based on 40% regular points, 30% group presentations, and 30% assignment reports.\nGrading is based on a 5-point system: S: 90 points or above, A: 80 points or above and less than 90 points, B: 70 points or above and less than 80 points,\nC: 60 points or above and less than 70 points, D: Less than 60%\nGrades will not be given to students whose attendance rate is less than 70%, but attendance alone is not considered class participation.\n\nReport Due date: 9/15 till 13:00\nS: ≧90%, >90% A ≧80%, 80> B ≧70%, >70% C ≧60%, 60% > D","message_from_instructor":"\n","course_keywords":"Industry-academia collaboration, Open Innovation, Innovation, Social implementation","office_hours":"Q&A session Before/After each lecture","remarks_1":"Dr. Hideaki Tsuru Mail Address：fv5424@go.tuat.ac.jp","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/6/2023 1:16:47 PM","name":{"id":188,"ja":"植物工学","en":"Plant Technology"},"instructor":{"id":189,"ja":"多羅尾 光徳","en":"TARAO Mitsunori"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"general education courses","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Institute of Global Innovation Research","office":"Kose'Lab","day_period":"Intensive","references":"\"Real In-house Innovators: Ecosystems Linking Innovation for Success,\" Junichi Handa, Nihon Keizai Shimbun Publishing Inc.
