Students will have the opportunity to engage in practical exercises while learning about the history of these insects through videos.","expected_learning":"The learning outcomes for this course include the ability to master the use of a compound microscope, develop skills for sketching insects, and gain an understanding of the history of insect chromosome construction on as revealed by the latest research.","course_schedule":"Genetic research is currently being actively pursued. However, understanding organisms cannot be achieved solely through genetics. It is also crucial to learn about the actual behavior and morphology of insects. To that end, students will become familiar with the use of compound microscopes, which are frequently used in such studies, and will watch videos recording insect behavior. Additionally, they will learn about actual methods for analyzing DNA sequences.","prerequisites":"There is no required textbook for this course, but it may be helpful to have a general entomology book that describes basic morphology.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"In the world, there exists so-called \"pseudoscience\".
