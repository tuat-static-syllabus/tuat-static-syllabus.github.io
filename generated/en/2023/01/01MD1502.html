An inquiry into Kyosei is carried out by referring to several experiences. 　　　　　","expected_learning":"The ultimate goal of this course is to improve the ability to think about various issues which our society has been currently faced with and future perspectives from multiple points of view and to deepen insights to understand such issues.\nCompetency development: Global awareness, Ability to Explore Knowledge, Communication skills, Presentation skills.\n","course_schedule":"The course is composed of two parts.　In part 1, viewing Kyosei　as a contemporarily meaningful and comprehensive perspective of humanities and social science, we attempt to identify and assess present situations and challenges that society has been currently faced with and inquire into the needs of and conditions for the establishment of Kyosei Kyosei society through a multidisciplinary approach.\nIn part 2, first, focusing on Kyosei between nature and humans, we examine the role of agriculture in our current society and the examples of Kyosei in agriculture.
