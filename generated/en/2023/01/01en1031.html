Participants will learn a series of flows that the difference in geology, topography and soil properties influences the water quality and that it also affects organisms in adjacent aquatic areas. Furthermore, various methods of biological / chemical researches and ecological conservation methods at the benthic boundary layer above the sediment / water column interface will be lectured.\n\nThis lecture is related to classes such as “Earth Science”, “Earth Environment Geology”, “Geochemistry”, “Ecosystem Management”, “Freshwater Environment Studies”, “Environmental Soil Science”, “Atmospheric Environmental Studies”, and “Marine Environmental Studies”, Participants are requested to systematically learn the connection between Atmosphere, hydrosphere and soil systems.","expected_learning":"Students who successfully completed the course of this lecture,\n\n-are able to explain how “terrestrial soil” and “sediment in hydrosphere” are created, what kind of physicochemical features, and what kind of differences exist depending on the region and the ocean area.\n\n-are able to explain the role of the characteristics of terrestrial soil and marine sediments for the ecosystem and the material circulation in the atmosphere and hydrosphere.\n\n-are able to explain the studied topics to the general public in an easily understandable manner as outreach activity.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nThis class is related to the diploma policies (A), (B), and (D) in Department of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences.\nPlease also refer to the following curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\n","course_schedule":"The lecture content will change depending on the participants interests, and progress of the lectures, but the following topics will be lectured.\n\n1. Improving Geoscience Literacy\n2. Formation of rock strata\n3. Weathering of rock, and formation of soils\n4. Influence of topography, geology and soil on river water quality\n5. Influence of topography, geology and soil on groundwater quality\n6. Effects of river / groundwater quality on aquatic ecosystem（1:lower trophic level）\n7. Effects of river / groundwater quality on aquatic ecosystem (2: higher trophic level)\n8. Characteristics and survey methods of sediments in the hydrosphere.\n9. The role of aquatic sediment in material circulation and formation of hypoxic water mass\n10. The role of aquatic sediment in material circulation (nutrients and organic matter)\n11. Characteristics and evaluation of sinking particles in the hydrosphere\n12. Analysis of pollution history using sediments in the hydrosphere\n13. Function and conservation of benthic macrophyte (seagrasses　and seaweeds)\n14. Function and conservation of coral communities\n15. Summary of lectures\n","prerequisites":"In addition to the school hours (30 hours), prepare and review the lecture referring to the distributed lecture materials and reference books.","texts_and_materials":"There is no text book, although it may be introduced during class as necessary.
