The purpose of this lecture is to acquire basic knowledge about livestock feed, nutrition, and rearing management of livestock.\n\n[Outline] This is a part of the Courses of Animal Production Science in the Department of Biological Production.\nIn this lecture, the instructor will explain (1) the nutritional value and characteristics of feed consumed by livestock and the preparation and processing for feed utilization, (2) the absorption and metabolism of ingested nutrients in the body of livestock and utilization for producing milk, meat, and egg, and (3) the rearing management to maximize the production performance, from the basic aspect with the latest research works. Lecture materials can be provided in advance and used for preparation, and the important points will be shown at the beginning of the lecture. The lecture will be promoted so that students can deepen their understanding of important points by asking questions in a quiz format after the lecture. Through this lecture, the instructor would like you to learn the basics of livestock industry, such as raising livestock and obtaining products comprehensively and systematically.","expected_learning":"Through this lecture, you will be able to understand and explain the basics of livestock nutrition and feeding management to obtain optimal products by rearing livestock and poultry under appropriate nutritional conditions.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy: See the curriculum maps. https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:　(A) To obtain a pluralistic perspective and a wide range of basic academic skills and knowledge in science of biological production and related scientific area, and to acquire flexible and logical thinking abilities to solve problems.","course_schedule":"A.
