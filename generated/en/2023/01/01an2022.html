Introduction\n2. Yield and dry matter production\n3. Leaf area expansion and canopy structure\n4. Effects of internal factors on leaf photosynthesis\n5. Effects of environmental factors on leaf photosynthesis\n6. Translocation of assimilates\n7. Partitioning of assimilates\n(Adachi)\n8. What is plant stress? An overview of the environment surrounding plants and plant response and defense mechanisms.\n9. High-temperature stress: impaired photosynthesis, altered respiration, reduced productivity and quality.\n10. Low-temperature stress: damage to biological membranes, cold damage, freezing injury\n11. Water absorption and transport in plants: water potential, roots, water conduction, transpiration\n12. Water stress: stomatal response, drought, excessive humidity\n13. Light stress and atmospheric environment: plant light response, global warming, air pollution\n14. Soil environment and nutrient uptake: soil properties, soil pH, salinity\n15.
