Students will experience different styles of lectures and classes depending on the contents. It consists of two parts.\n\nPart I : Common Introductory Program\nIn this program that is common to all first-year students, students will learn about our university and think how they would pursue their academic life here. The university history and TUAT principals are described as well as our research activities, with the aim of encouraging students to engage in university study and to understanding the importance of designing their individual university life.\n\nPart II : Faculty-Specific Program\nTheme: Let's Think about the Appropriate Management of Research on Life Science\n\nHow is the research and development of cosmetics and detergents we use daily, foods and supplements we consume every day, or pharmaceutical products conducted? In many studies, research is conducted with laboratory animals to evaluate their effects on humans. These include mammals such as mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs, as well as fish and insects. In addition, research using genetically modified animals and plants, for example, contributes greatly to society, but at the same time involves the risks of spreading animals and plants that do not originally exist. In considering how to develop such life science research while ensuring safety and security, and what measures those engaged in research must take to achieve this, it is extremely important to know the field, explore the problems, and constructively predict the future.\nIn this basic seminar, each participant will gather information on various situations surrounding life science research from various sources, make presentations, and engage in discussions to solve problems. In addition, students will have opportunities to visit and experience actual research organization.\n","expected_learning":"1. To understand the autonomous learning in the University, and be able to design individual's academic life at University from broad perspectives.\n2. Be able to independently explore and solve problems facing life science research.\n1) Know the research field.\n2) Understand the approaches to risk at home and abroad.\n3) To comprehensively overview the results of independent research.\n4) Present and discuss the results of their research in an appropriate manner.\n\nCompetency Development：\nInitiative and Autonomy, Leadership and Facilitation, Knowledge Creation, Presentation Skills, Mission-Oriented Research and Problem Solving, Academic Ethics","course_schedule":"Part I: Common Introductory Program\n1. About the University (I)\n　　Brief history of the University. Talks from the President, the Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, and the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering.\n2. About the University (II)\n　　Talks from the Heads of the Departments.\n3. Studying at the University\n　　Differences between studying at high school and studying at university. Designing your academic life at the University from broad perspectives.\nQuestioning minds that lead you to the depth of academic study and research\n4. Energy-saving and Safety in university life\nGlobal warming and emission of green house gas. Our effort in reducing CO2 emission.\nRisk management in laboratories. Your action to ensure own and others' safety. Risks of harmful chemicals and proper ways of their disposal.\n5. Research ethics\nCode of conduct for research integrity, and scientific misconducts. Falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism are discussed.\n\nPart II: Faculty-Specific Program\n6. Orientation (questionnaire, how to make a presentation, introduction to the faculty member's laboratory)\n7. Discussion of actual life science research and problems faced.\n8. Grasping the current status and issues of research using animals.\n9. Learn about breeding and proper care of various animals.\n10. Tour of research laboratories.\n11. Tour of research laboratories.\n12. Experiencing research techniques and organizing issues.\n13. 1st presentation (by 3 students), Q&A session\n14. Second presentation (3 students), Q&A\n15. Third presentation (2 students), Q&A, general discussion\n(The 6th to 12th sessions may be postponed. Details will be provided at the orientation.)","prerequisites":"Part I: In addition to 10 hours you spend in the class, you are recommended to review the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University for each class, to plan out the courses to take and design how you would pursue your academic activities ahead.\n\nPart II: Ability to operate PowerPoint is desirable. In addition to the 10 seminar hours, students will be asked to organize materials they have independently searched, construct a presentation plan, prepare presentation materials, and make a presentation.","texts_and_materials":"Part I: Handouts and exercise materials are provided during the class.\n\nPart II: Nothing is necessary, because all the published data are obtained from internet service or e-journal search in the library.","assessment":"Part I (25%)： Marks are given based on worksheets collected at the end of each class.\nPart II (75%)：Attendance of 80% or more is a requirement for credit, and evaluation will be based on a weighting system of 50% for the degree of positivity in research, presentation, and participation in discussions, and 50% for the presentation.","message_from_instructor":"Hope that this basic seminar will help you understand the importance of life science research and what kind of research is being conducted day and night to protect the safety and security of our society.","course_keywords":"Part I: Questioning mind, Autonomous learning Part II: Laboratory animals, genetic modification, prevention of proliferation","office_hours":"Part I: It will be announced during the class.
