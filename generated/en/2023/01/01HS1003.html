It is also important to avoid \"essencesizing\" culture or understanding it traditionally, as it can be mistakenly portrayed as having fixed characteristics in a particular group.\nThis lecture explores difficult questions related to cultural complexity, diversity, concept of identity, and power relations, mainly from the experiences and histories of various minority parties in Japan society. Because the conventional logic of multicultural coexistence has had the limit of falling into a cultural essentialist dichotomy of \"others\" and \"us\" with different cultural backgrounds, it is necessary to accept diverse differences and learn from various experiences.\nWhat should be done to open up Japan to a society where everyone can live comfortably? Through this lecture, we can promote community harmony, anti-racism, cross-cultural understanding, and positive relationships among citizens of all cultural backgrounds by having a perspective that can be considered as one's own matter.\n\nThis course is offered as a humanities and social science course in the Global Liberal Arts Course.\n","expected_learning":"1.
