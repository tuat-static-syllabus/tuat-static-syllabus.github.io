We will learn the structure and function of cells, the mechanism of energy production in cells, and the transfer and utilization of genetic information from nucleic acids, especially DNA, to biomolecules. We will then learn how such scientific phenomena and the knowledge are applied in industrial and biomedical technologies that support our traditional, modern and future lives.　This lecture course includes interactive classes, discussion sessions and opportunities for presentation.\n\nThis course is offered as part of the Multidisciplinary Courses in Global Integrated Studies of the Liberal Arts and Fundamental Studies, and is also open to international students of STEP (Short Term Exchange Program).\n","expected_learning":"1. To gain a fundamental understanding of ‘life’ at the cellular and molecular levels and to apply such knowledge in learning biotechnology and modern molecular techniques\n2. To understand updated interdisciplinary biological topics relating to chemistry, physics, medicine and veterinary medicine in English, and to be able to describe a topic of own interest in English\n\nCompetency development:\nGlobal awareness,　Innovative Thinking, Communication Skills, Presentation skills\n","course_schedule":"1. Carbohydrates, lipids, and chemical energy that sustains life. 【Exercise】Thought problems on acquisition of energy to sustain life\n2. Proteins, enzymes and their applications in industry. 【Exercise】How are artificial enzymes designed to create new function?\n3. Anaerobic respiration and fermentation. 【Exercise】Discussion on how anaerobic respiration drives industry such as fermentation industry and bioethanol production\n4. Aerobic respiration and ATP synthase. 【Exercise】Thought problems on how inhibitors were used to study and manipulate the reaction pathways\n5. Photosynthesis (1): conversion of light energy to chemical energy. 【Exercise】Thought problems on the evolution of two photosystems.\n6. Photosynthesis (2): storage of chemical energy. 【Exercise】How is photosynthesis used in industry? Discussion on bioplastics and plant molecular factory.\n7. Cellular Organization: organelles’ structure/function in health and disease and the cutting-edge techniques behind it. 【Exercise】How to visualize specific proteins in various kinds of biological specimens?\n8. Cellular membranes: structure/function in health and disease, their importance in biotechnology. 【Exercise】How can “membrane transport” be used as a target for a new drug against cancer?\n9. Cellular Signaling in health and disease, traditional and novel methods used to unravel the complexity of signaling pathways. 【Exercise】How can mutant proteins help understand intracellular signaling mechanisms?\n10. Mitosis and Meiosis: mechanisms of these processes in normal cells and how diseases are caused in cancer cells. 【Exercise】How to download gene sequences from the databases and store them for your studies?\n11. Basics of genetics: mechanisms of preservation, replication and repair of genetic information in normal cells and how abnormal functions are caused in cells with in cancer and aging process. 【Exercise】How to find homologous sequences in the database and compare gene sequences each other? How to draw phylogenetic trees?\n12. Gene expression: protein synthesis based on genetic information in normal cells and its application in biotechnology and in medicine. 【Exercise】How to obtain polypeptide sequences from the genes that encode them? How to obtain information about gene functions from the polypeptide sequences?\n13. Control of gene expression: controls through multiple levels including transcription, translation and stability of proteins, the processes through development and differentiation, and their roles in diseases. 【Exercise】How to obtain information about differential gene expression during developmental differentiation, among different tissues including cancer cells (use of the databases of new generation sequencing, quantitative PCR, microarray and so on).\n14. Presentations by students on specified topics\n15. Summary\nExamination\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours you spend in the class and 4 hours in preparing your presentation, you are recommended to prepare for and revise the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University, using the lecture handouts available from Moodle or Google Classroom and the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"Grades are given based 40 % on examination scores and 60 % on contribution during the classes and presentation.
