Various computations will be practiced with drawing diagrams","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiation and integration of two, or multivariable functions, and\n(2) to be capable of performing practical computations.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps","course_schedule":"1. Functions of several variables\n2. Ttotal differentiations\n3. differenciations of composite functions\n4. Higher order partial differentiations, and Taylor's theorem\n5.
