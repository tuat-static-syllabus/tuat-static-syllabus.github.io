Innate immunity and acquired immunity are essential mechanisms to maintain the body’s homeostasis. Research on innate immunity and acquired immunity in particular has revealed in detail the complexity of the biological network in which competent cells and humoral factors produced by cells are intricately involved. Pathologies of various diseases due to immune disorders are analyzed, providing very valuable information to elucidate their causes. This course will help students to understand the individual characteristics of groups of cells and humoral factors (such as cytokines) that constitute the body’s immune system and it will teach about mechanisms of maintaining homeostatic function and illness arising from disruption of those mechanisms. Teachers carry out the lectures based on their much experiences in the immunology research.","expected_learning":"①To understand immune mechanisms related to distinguishing self from other.\n②To understand systems of innate immunity and acquired immunity.\n③To understand types of allergies and development of allergic conditions.\n","course_schedule":"Classes will consist with online lectures. However, final examination will be held in the classroom.\n\n1. Biological defense mechanism\n2. Mechanisms of inducing inflammation\n3. Inflammatory and immunocompetent cells\n4. Antigen-presenting cells and antigen processing\n5. T cells\n6. B cells\n7. Cytokines and immune mechanisms\n8. The complement system\n9. Acquired immunity to pathogens\n10. Allergic reactions\n11. Transplant rejection\n12. Autoimmune reactions\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 15 times of the lectures, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"A passing grade in this course is a total score of 60 points or more on tests given by each course instructor.\nStudents must attend 80% or more of the classes in this course. Students with an attendance rate below 80% will fail this course, regardless of their exam results. In addition, students will not be allowed to re-take the exam.\n","message_from_instructor":"Immunology is a discipline that is still developing. Research in this field is taking place at quite a rapid pace, and consolidating those findings will be a challenge. However, the process of identifying unknowns is very appealing.
