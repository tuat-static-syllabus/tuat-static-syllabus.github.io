This class will learn balance of mass and heat, basic theory of transfer phenomena ( ex. flow, heat transfer, diffusion), kinetics of chemical reaction and sterilization in foods, and fundamental of food refrigeration. In addition, the quantitative risk assessment, which is a typical method for quantitative estimation of food safety, will be also referred. The first half of the lecture will be an overview of the faculty members, and the second half will be a case study in which issues will be set and the solutions will be addressed.\n","expected_learning":"The goal is to comprehensively learn from the basics to applications related to food manufacturing.\nThe following individual goals are set.\n1) Acquire the idea of improving efficiency in the food manufacturing process.\n2) Understand management related to safety, security and food hygiene.\n3) Understand the kinetics of sterilization and be able to perform simple sterilization calculations.\n5) Explain the principle of food freezing operation.\n6) Understand the principle of food risk assessment and be able to calculate simple risks.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\n","course_schedule":"Lesson 1 Outline, Food engineering\nLesson 2 Unit\nLesson 3 Water in food\nLesson 4 Food processing１（Brewing）\nLesson 5 Food processing２（Drink）\nLesson 6 Food processing３（Dairy products, milk）\nLesson 7 Food processing 4 (Processed milk products)\nLesson 8 Food processing 5　(meat products)\nLesson 9 Food refrigeration / food preservation 1\nLesson 10 Food refrigeration / food preservation 2\nLesson 11 Food market theory\nLesson 12 Food processing\nLesson 13 Diffusion (solid, liquid, gas)\nLesson 14 Flow and Rheology\nLesson 15 Summary and Test\n","prerequisites":"Learners are recommended to complete Food Chemistry 1 & 2 and Food Processing.\nIn addition to the lectures in the class, you are recommended to prepare and review the class using the standard amount of time as specified by the university for each class.\n","texts_and_materials":"To refer the materials posted in the classroom as possible.","assessment":"Test and Reporting assignment: 100%\n","message_from_instructor":"It is also an important lecture content as a basis in the manufacturing of food, chemical products, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. In order to deepen the understanding, we plan to incorporate exercises as much as possible into the lessons. Case studies will be conducted face-to-face.
