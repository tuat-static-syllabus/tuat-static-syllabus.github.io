In order to solve these problems, various projects related to environmental conservation have been implemented under the initiative of local governments. In implementing the project, it is important for multi-stakeholder from different positions such as local governments, NPOs, private companies, and academics to hold discussions, but in fact, it is difficult to reach consensus. On the other hand, there are cases that have led to the creation of new industries, such as the effective use of invasive species as compost through the cooperation of multi-stakeholder.\nThis lecture course is included in the Global Integrated Studies of the Liberal Arts and Fundamental Studies. We will learn how the conservation and restoration of the natural environment has been carried out by involving multi-stakeholder from different positions, taking as an example the environmental conservation and nature restoration projects implemented in Japan. Furthermore, the goal is to be able to identify issues through group discussions and propose solutions to issues amid various social restrictions.\nThe faculty member in charge of this course has practical experience in working on the conservation and restoration of the natural environment as an engineer of a private company and a researcher of a national research institute, and will develop classes while sharing the knowledge gained in practice. In addition, we will invite engineers from NPO corporations involved in park green space management in Tokyo and researchers from private companies involved in environmental conservation projects nationwide as guest lecturers to report on the current status and issues of environmental conservation.\n\n(Google Classroom Code: zgkhjgn)","expected_learning":"1) To be able to explain the current status and issues of environmental conservation and nature restoration projects implemented in Japan.\n2) To be able to explain the current status and issues of industry-government-academia collaboration in environmental conservation.\n3) Organize and analyze the current status and issues of environmental conservation through group activities, and propose solutions to the issues. The content of the recommendations can be summarized as a report.\n\nComplementary development: Initiative and Autonomy, Leadership and Coordination,　Innovative Thinking, Communication Skills, Effective Writing Skills, Presentation skills, Problem-Solving","course_schedule":"1st day\n#1 Overview of Environmental Conservation and Nature Restoration in Japan\nAt the beginning of the lesson, I will explain the purpose of this lesson, how to proceed, and the evaluation method.\nOutline the basic flow of environmental conservation and nature restoration in Japan, and explain how multi-stakeholder from different positions such as local governments, NPOs, companies, and academics are involved.\n#2 Environmental Conservation, Nature Restoration Project and Industry-government-Academia Collaboration Case Study\nIntroduce examples of environmental conservation and nature restoration projects in Japan (Kushiro Marsh, Lake Kasumigaura, Inba-numa lake, etc.) and explain how industry-government-academia collaboration has been carried out in each case.\n#3 Environmental Conservation Initiatives and Issues in Private Companies\nWe will invite researchers from company as guest lecturers to give lectures on the efforts and issues of companies in the field of environmental conservation and nature restoration nationwide.\n\n2nd day\n#4 Outline of Environmental Conservation in Parks and Green Spaces in Urban Areas\nIntroducing environmental conservation efforts being implemented in urban parks such as Inokashira Park, Sengenyama Park, and Nogawa Park. Explain how multi-stakeholder from different positions are involved.\n#5 NPO corporation's environmental conservation efforts and issues\nI will invite engineers who work for NPO corporations as guest lecturers to give lectures on the efforts and issues of NPO corporations mainly in the field of environmental conservation in Tokyo.\n#6 Fieldwork (Sengenyama Park)\nBy inspecting the sites of environmental conservation in Sengenyama Park, you have a concrete image of practical examples of environmental conservation and industry-government-academia collaboration.\n\n3rd day\n#7 Group Work (Analysis of current situation, problem solution method)\nA group of 4 to 5 people will take up specific examples of environmental conservation and nature restoration that are being carried out in various regions of the country, analyze the current situation through literature research, and extract the status of industry-government-academia collaboration and issues. In the class, you will discuss the desirable method of problem solving based on the results collected by all the members.
