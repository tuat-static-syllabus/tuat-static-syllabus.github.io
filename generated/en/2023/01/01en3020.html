The course introduces understanding of the microorganisms from the view points of microbial ecology and microbial physiology. The course gives essential knowledge needed for many aspects of bioremediation.","expected_learning":"Students are expected,\n1. to understand the relationships between microbial functions and environmental factors and to explain the phenomena by the knowledge of biochemistry and molecular ecology.\n2. to acquire creativity to solve environmental problems by using capacities of microorganisms.\n\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy. See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )","course_schedule":"The course covers the following:\n\n<TARAO Mitsunori>\n1. Introduction: Why do we need to study Physiology and Ecology of Microorganisms\n2. Microbbial rimary production\n3. Degradation of organic materials\n4. Microbial biomass and its limiting factors\n5. Microorganisms in anaerobic habitat\n6. Microorganisms relevant to the nitrogen cycle\n7. Microbial activities in soil\n\n<YOSHIDA Makoto>\n8. A brief history of mycology\n9. Industrial utilisation of fungi\n10. Taxonomy of fungi\n11. Genetics of fungi\n12. Relationship fungi and plants -symbiosis-\n13. Relationship fungi and plants -plant pathology-\n14. Relationship fungi and plants -decay-\n15. Summary and final examination","prerequisites":"Having took courses of microbiology, environmental microbiology, biological chemistry are recommended.\n\n<TARAO>\n- It is desirable to download handouts and summaries and to complete an assignment prior to every class. Completion of assignments are not compulsory, but understanding the class is much harder if not.\n- Submitting a questionnaire every class is compulsory.\n- Handing assignments, questionnaire in at the end of every class is required.\n\n<YOSHIDA>\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for\nand revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and\nusing the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"<TARAO> Distributed via the moodle\n<YOSHIDA> Materials distributed at the lecture","assessment":"<TARAO> Weekly assignment (20%), Questionary (20%), and final examination (60%).\n<YOSHIDA> Instructed at the lecture","message_from_instructor":"<TARAO>\n- Questioning mind is indispensable.
