Outline of forest ecology: Aims and standard, Linkage between forest ecology and the associated course.\n2. The concept and characteristics of Forest ecosystems: What is the Forest ecosystems?\n3. Production in forest ecosystems: Environment and competition\n4. Nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems: function of soil and microbes\n5. Evolution and physiological ecology of trees\n6. Symbiosis of trees with fungi and microorganisms\n7. Reaction of trees corresponding to environments\n8. Climate changes and soundness of forest ecosystem\n9. The characteristics of mammals and birds in forest ecosystems\n10. The function of forest as habitat for animals\n11. The function of animals in forest ecosystems\n12.
