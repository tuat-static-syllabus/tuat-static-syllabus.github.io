It consists of two parts.\n\nPart I : Common Introductory Program\nIn this program that is common to all first-year students, students will learn about our university and discuss how they would pursue their academic life in the Univeristy. The university history and TUAT principals are described as well as our research activities, with the aim to encourage students to become engaged in university study and to understand the importance of designing their individual university life.\n\nPart II : Faculty-Specific Program\n","expected_learning":"1) To understand the autonomous learning in the University, and be able to design individual's academic life at the University from broad perspectives.\n2)In the 20th century, Japan's economy developed through mass production, mass consumption, and mass disposal, but this century is about to see a shift from such a society to a recycling-oriented society with an emphasis on the environment. Since the end of the Edo period, the sericulture industry has mass-produced cocoons as raw materials for industrial production, and the silk industry has used these cocoons to produce and export raw silk. The sericultural industry (sericultural industry and silk industry) has contributed to the economic development of Japan.\n　Today, the sericulture industry is in the process of changing from the mass production of cocoons to the production of unique fibers, textiles, and medicinal materials. In addition, \"silkworms\" are susceptible to insecticides and other pesticides, and very few pesticides are used in mulberry farms. Cocoons become natural fiber, and sericulture is a very environmentally friendly industry. In our seminar, we are planning to consider its multipurpose use with mulberry and silkworm (cocoons).\n\nCompetency Development：\nInitiative and Autonomy, Leadership and Facilitation, Knowledge Creation, Presentation Skills, Mission-Oriented Research and Problem Solving, Academic Ethics","course_schedule":"Part I : Common Introductory Program\n1.
