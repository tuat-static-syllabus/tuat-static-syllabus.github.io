On the other hand, environmental pollution caused by mass consumption and disposal of plastics has become a big problem. Therefore, the United Nations (UN) has adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Europe has proposed the Circular Economy (CE), and Japan is also actively working on enacting the \"Basic Law for Establishing a Recycling Society\" and advocating the \"Osaka Blue Ocean Vision\". In this lecture, I will give a lecture on \"mass consumption of fossil resources\" and \"environmental outflow \" as environmental problems caused by plastics, and then give lectures on bio-based materials, biodegradable materials, and plastic recycling.\n(Konno)\nUtilization of renewable biomass resources is key technology to build circulatory society. In this lecture, students learn the properties of plant biomass and its biological degradation.","expected_learning":"(Tachibana)\nLearners who successfully complete will be able to:\n(1) Recognize environmental problems by plastics and its solution: C~A\n(2) In addition to (1), you will be able to correctly explain the current situations and issues of bio-based materials, biodegradable materials, and plastic recycling: B~A\n(3) Propose own ideas regarding environmental problems by plastics and its solution : A~S\n\n(Konno)\nThe students are expected to understand basics of wood biodegradation mechanisms and to be able to think out the effective utilization of plant biomass.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"(Tachibana)\nLecturing on following topics:\n① Environmental problems caused by plastics\n② Bio-based materials\n③ Production of commodity plastics from biomass\n④ Production of bio-based plastics from inedible biomass\n⑤ Biodegradation in natural environment\n⑥ Commercially available biodegradable plastics\n⑦ Current issues of biodegradable plastics\n⑧ Plastic recycling\n\n(Konno)\n1.
