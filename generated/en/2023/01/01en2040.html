In addition to the conventional material design method of maximizing performance and minimizing cost, Eco Material is a material and design method that minimizes environmental impact throughout the entire process (production cycle, production, use, recycling, and disposal) . In this lecture, as a basic section, we will comprehensively and multifacetly describe the concepts　necessary for designing eco-materials. In addition, in the application section, we will describe the characteristics of materials currently considered as eco-materials (mainly materials made from wood and wood resources, plastic materials, etc.).\n\nThis course will be a practitioner subject.","expected_learning":"As various environmental problems surround, understand the basic idea of eco-friendly materials (eco-materials) and the direction that materials should aim.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"Kawarada\n1.
