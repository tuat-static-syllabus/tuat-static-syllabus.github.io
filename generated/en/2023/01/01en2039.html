The lecture will be given on the relationship between plant morphology, organization, and structure and the adaptability of plants to their environment. In particular, the characteristics and formation mechanisms of anatomy and structure of trees, which are perennial plants in terms of cell biology and tree physiology. In addition, lectures will be given on biological imaging techniques, which are important for the development of plant science. This lecture is positioned as an introduction to the wood science and forest science classes that will follow.","expected_learning":"I will make a lecture concerning the mechanism of plant anatomy and structure under different environmental conditions.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1) Importance of plants①\n2) Importance of plants②\n3) Mechanism of plant growth①\n4) Mechanism of plant growth②\n5) Mechanism of plant differentiation①\n6) Mechanism of plant differentiation②\n7) Mechanism of plant cell wall formation①\n8) Mechanism of plant cell wall formation②\n9) Mechanism of radial growth of trees①\n10) Mechanism of radial growth of trees②\n11) Mechanism of adaptation of trees under different growth conditions①\n12) Mechanism of adaptation of trees under different growth conditions②\n13) Bio-Imaging Technologies①\n14) Bio-Imaging Technologies②\n15) Summary","prerequisites":"Students need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts as needed.","assessment":"Examination (100%)","message_from_instructor":"The lectures will be given for understanding the dynamics of morphogenesis and cell wall structure formation mechanisms in plants, especially tree cells, and also provide students with the importance and novelty of plant science.
