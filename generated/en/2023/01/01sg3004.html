Therefore, in this society, engineering ethics is not a manual which only engineers should learn, nor a just one part of an ethics. Engineering ethics involves basic problems which every people confront in their everyday life. The purpose of this course is to study about the basic problems of technology and ethics (ex. the ethics of the future generation, or risk society, etc.), and to study how to solve the peculiar problems (like pollution problems, environmental destructions, whistle-blowing, handling the big data and biotechnology, etc.) which engineer are faced. We study these topics through the specific cases.\nThis course is designed as one of the courses for the Scientific General Education courses of the Global Liberal Arts Studies.","expected_learning":"1. To understand the basic framework of ethics(especially academic ethics), apply it and determine the various specific case which engineers are faced.\n2. To understand the various problems which engineering were faced, and explain how they responded in terms of ethics.\n3. To have knowledge on science and technology about how to various technologies which support our everyday life save our safety.","course_schedule":"Lecture 1\nGuidance/engineering ethics (1); What is ethics\nLecture 2\nEngineering ethics (2); Who is the engineer\nLecture 3\nEngineering ethics (3); Risk\nLecture 4\nEngineering ethics (4); Whistle‐blowing\nLecture 5\nEngineering ethics (5); Accountability\nLecture 6\nInformation society and engineering ethics (1); Bio-power and big data\nLecture 7\nInformation society and engineering ethics (2); Cyborg technology\nLecture 8\nInformation society and engineering ethics (3); Bioethics\nLecture 9\nAgriculture and engineering ethics (1); Inheritable genetic modification and its use\nLecture 10\nAgriculture and engineering ethics (2); Industrialization of agriculture\nLecture 11\nModern society and engineer (1); The ethics of the future generation and engineer\nLecture 12\nModern society and engineer (2); 3.11 and engineer\nLecture 13\nModern society and engineer (3); MINAMATA disease and engineer\nLecture 14\nModern society and engineer (4); Research ethics\nLecture 15\nSummary of whole lecture, Clues to become a better engineer","prerequisites":"This course carries 2 credits.\nIn addition to 15 lectures, please continue to prepare and review this lecture spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University for each class, while paying attention to the daily news related to science and technology.","texts_and_materials":"Distribute handouts accordingly","assessment":"Grades are given based 60 % on the two written assignments, and 40 % on contribution during the classes.","message_from_instructor":"Ethics and technology are not just academic learning. It is a lively essential element to support our daily life. Therefore, to study about these things is extremely important for our life.
