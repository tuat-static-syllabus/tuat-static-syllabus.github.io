Also, the demand for the food that would enhance good health is increasing in Japanese society which is rapidly aging. While thanks to globalization we can currently obtain a variety of foods from all over the world, the domestic food sufficiency ratio is decreasing, with increase in the food processing intensity. In this context, food-related accidents frequently occur so that ensuring food safety would be the traditional, but new important issue in modern society.\n　This course provides students with opportunities to consider the measures to ensure food safety and healthy diet.","expected_learning":"A student is required to understand what our society should be in order to ensure food safety as well as psychological security for food. Also, she/he is required to summarize such an issue in the form of a written report.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps. (URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )","course_schedule":"Please also check the Google Classroom.\n\nThe goal of this course is to understand food safety issues, compering Japan and the World, especially, EU in terms of food safety policy and regulations.\nAs for Japan, we address various issues related to food safety in a historical perspective. Because consumers' power is essential to ensure food safety, we review the consumer movement in Japan both in the past and at present.\nAs for EU, the development of food safety policy is attributed to the incidence of BSE, we need to know various issues underlying BSE such as livestock product issues, farm animal issues and animal welfare. To deal with these issues, the effective framework for ensuring food safety were required. Risk analysis was adopted as a tool to design such a framework. Thus, through learning risk analysis, we consider what our society should be in order to ensure food safety.","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and review the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University using the lecture materials.","texts_and_materials":"No specific textbook is used.
