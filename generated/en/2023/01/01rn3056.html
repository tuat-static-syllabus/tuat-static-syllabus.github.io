In the lecture, students learn the types of electromagnetic waves observed by sensors, the characteristics of objects and materials constituting the atmosphere and ground surface for electromagnetic waves, and the basics of analyzing image data observed by various sensors mounted on earth observation satellites. In addition, the potential applications of remote sensing technology to various regional issues in urban, rural, and forest areas will be discussed.","expected_learning":"(1) Understand the types of electromagnetic waves and their reflection/emission characteristics, types of sensors, and observation principles of various sensors.\n(2) Identify ground surface conditions from multispectral satellite imageries.\n(3) Understand basic knowledge of satellite image analysis to quantitatively the state of the earth's surface and its changes over time.\n\nDetail information is provided in the following map. https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1.
