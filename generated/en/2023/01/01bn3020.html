This lecture covers structures and types of macromolecules in living organisms, including nucleic acids, proteins, and glycans. The first part of the lecture covers recent knowledge about the expression of genetic information in nucleic acids. The second part of the lecture covers the biological roles of post-translational modifications of proteins, focusing on the functions and diversity of glycosylation on proteins. The third part of the lecture covers the structure and function of the extracellular matrix, which consists of proteins and glycans.\n[Curriculum Positioning] This course is a common department subject, and provides topics based on biochemistry.","expected_learning":"- Understanding the biochemistry of protein and the physiological roles of protein folding.\n- Understanding the structures and types of glycans, and also understanding the physiological functions, roles, and their relations to diseases.\n- Understanding the major components and physiological functions of extracellular matrix.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: (B)\nPlease refer to the curriculum map at the following URL:\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1) Storage of genetic information in the nucleus\n2) Epigenetic controls of gene expression\n3) mRNA maturation and splicing\n4) Protein translation and folding\n5) Protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses\n6) Redox control of protein function\n7) Basic structure of glycans and its role in protein quality control\n8) Diversity of glycosylation in the Golgi\n9) Glycan biosynthesis and degradation: Its abnormalities in diseases\n10) Functions of glycan in cell-cell interactions\n11) Basis of the extracellular matrix\n12) Biosynthesis of proteoglycans and its functions\n13) Biosynthesis of Hyaluronan and its functions\n14) Biosynthesis of Collagen and its functions\n15) Function of extracellular matrix in the nervous system","prerequisites":"Students need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts are provided if needed.","assessment":"Performance in lecture (including mini-tests) (30%) and assignment report (70%)","message_from_instructor":"We hope that this lecture will help you on your research in the future.","course_keywords":"protein, glycan, extracellular matrix","office_hours":"Please contact by e-mail.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"https://sites.google.com/go.tuat.ac.jp/miyatalab","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/10/2023 11:40:31 AM","name":{"id":124,"ja":"分析科学","en":"Analytical Science"},"instructor":{"id":123,"ja":"横山 岳, 伊藤 克彦","en":"YOKOYAMA Takeshi, ITO Katsuhiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":14,"min":3},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Institute of Agriculture","office":"Hortscience Lab.","day_period":"Mon.1","references":"Essential cell biology\nEssentials of Glycobiology\n"}}
