Foods such as milk, meat, and eggs produced by livestock contribute significantly as a source of high-quality animal protein and support rich dietary lifestyle. The purpose of this lecture is to learn comprehensively the characteristics of livestock and the basic of technology supporting the livestock industry. Lectures will be given with the latest knowledge in addition to the basic knowledge described in textbooks.\n[Overview]\n1. Livestock origins, classification and characteristics; You learn the basic characteristics of livestock species, such as pig, cattle, chicken, horse, sheep, goat, etc., and their breeds, which are basis of production of animal products.\n2. Scientific base of livestock production technology; We learn livestock breeding, reproduction, nutritional physiology, feeding management, hygiene, and behavior and welfare, which relate to livestock production technology. Also, we learn animal products processing, utilization of by-products, livestock farm management, and the current circumstances surrounding livestock industry.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand the basics of animal science comprehensively; how livestock are raised, how livestock products are produced, and what technologies contribute to livestock production.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:See the Curriculum maps.(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1.
