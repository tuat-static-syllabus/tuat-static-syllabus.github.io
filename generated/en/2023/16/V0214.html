In order to reduce such discrepancies, it is important not only to deeply learn the contents taught by the instructors, but also to consider what, why, and how. Based on these, I plan to design and practice the lessons and learn how to consider them and their importance.\n\n1 Guidance: What to teach and what to learn in science classes\n2 Examining the expression ― Taking power as an example\n3 Contents to be taught ―Taking the class of inertia and acceleration as an example―\n4 Selection of contents of class ―Example of nuclear and radiation class―\n5 How students see and perceive-An example of the nature and nature of waves-\n6 Structure of class\n7 Teaching plan Design drawing of class\n8 Teaching plan Lesson plan②\n9 Changes in the lesson plan ―Taking action / reaction classes as an example―\n10 Examination of lesson plan and lesson practice (instructor's lesson) ①\n11 Examination of lesson plan and lesson practice (instructor's lesson) ②\n12 Simulation class by students and its examination①\n13 Simulation class by students and its examination②\n14 Simulation class by students and its examination③\n15 Summary of class\n\nThe order of introduction and practice classes may be changed.\n","prerequisites":"In addition to class hours, we plan to create a lesson plan by referring to the distributed materials.","texts_and_materials":"None (Introduce in the class if necessary)","assessment":"Report that also serves as attendance (50%)\nAssignments distributed in class (including before and after) (20%)\nLesson plan and contents of mock class (30%)\n","message_from_instructor":"Natural science has evolved while learning from each other not through the achievements of any one person in history, but through discussions with various people (who were around) and experiments and observations.\nWe expect independent participation (questions and remarks) so that they can learn from each other in this class.\n","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Questions will be accepted before or after each class or by email.
