The schedule may be added or changed in the future. In that case, it will be clearly stated.\n\n(Purpose)\nStudents obtain basic knowledge for creating new fields and social implementation from their research expertise. They consider the future development of their research from the viewpoints of agricultural-engineering collaboration, diversity, and the creation of new industries.\n\n(Overview)\nLectures on how to formulate research concepts and procedures for conducting research in each phases of basic research → applied research → practical application development. If the research theme does not reach to practical application and/or development due to its characteristics, the students are encouraged to envision a new field creation; from a basic research to an academic transformation. Workshop-style classes will be conducted for students who are beginning research to construct their idea based on their individual research theme.\nThis lecture will be given as an intensive course. The schedule will be announced as soon as it is decided.","expected_learning":"Students are expected to acquire the basis for developing conceptual and step-by-step implementation skills for the future based on one's own research theme. We hope students to have ideas of what is really required, what are the challenges, and what should be done to implement the results of their own research in society.","course_schedule":"(1) Preliminary study\nLecture on how to formulate research concepts and research execution procedures in each phase of basic research → applied research → practical application development. Based on the above lecture content, students consider about the steps to take to develop their own research into a practical application or to create a new field, and submit their ideas on the worksheet and template distributed in advance.\n(2) Workshop\nStudents will present the contents of their preliminary studies and improve their research development plans through discussion among students and guidance from the instructor.\n(3) Post-workshop study\nBased on what you learnt in the workshop, consider again about your own research development and the steps to reach your goals, and summarize them in a report.\n","prerequisites":"This is a required course for all WISE program students. Students are recommended to take in the first year as it is the foundation for future study in the WISE program.","texts_and_materials":"Hilary Glasman-deal, “Science Research Writing: For Native and Non-native Speakers of English”ISBN-13:978-1786347831 (World Scientific Pub Co Inc)","assessment":"Evaluation will be based on the content of the workshop presentations and the final report.","message_from_instructor":"To involve in society construction as a high-level Ph.D talent, please learn and consider how you develop your research.","course_keywords":"Research conceptualization, Agricultural and engineering collaboration, Creation of new industries, Creation of new fields, Diversity","office_hours":"Office hours are arranged with the lecturer through WISE faculty.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/17/2023 8:20:13 PM","name":{"id":904,"ja":"Advances in Mechanical Systems Engineering","en":"Advances in Mechanical Systems Engineering"},"instructor":{"id":715,"ja":"安藤 泰久, 岩見 健太郎","en":"ANDO Yasuhisa, IWAMI Kentaro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"WISE PROGRAM","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Institute of Global Innovation Research Innovation Advancement Organization","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Foong May Yeong“How to Read and Critique a Scientific Research Article: Notes to Guide Students Reading Primary Literature”, ISBN-13:978-9814579162 (World Scientific Pub Co Inc)\n\nDevon D.
