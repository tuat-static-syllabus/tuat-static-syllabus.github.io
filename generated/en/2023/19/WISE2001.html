Eight lectures will be given on the process and issues of how these researchers have grasped society, developed agricultural-and-engineering collaborative research there, and how they have achieved social implementation. Students will consider from what perspective they should look at society in order to link their own research to social implementation, and consider their own future research development from the perspectives of agricultural-engineering collaborative creation (fusion), diversity, and the creation of new industries.\n\nThe class will be held every Friday during 4th or 5th period from June to July, and students are required to submit a report based on discussions in the class after the completion of 8 classes. Grades will be determined by class attendance, attendance attitude such as speaking during the question and answer period, and evaluation of the report.\n\n","expected_learning":"As a basis for acquiring the abilities to boldly envision the future and steadily implement step-by-step, students will have an idea of what is really required, what are the challenges, and what should be done to implement the results of one's own research in society.","course_schedule":"\"The first half of each session will be a lecture. Students will consider from what perspective they should look at society in order to further advance their own research techniques and knowledge and turn them into research seeds, as well as the future development of their own research from the viewpoints of agricultural-engineering fusion, diversity, and the creation of new industries. In the latter half of the class, students who have listened to the lecture on \"Creation of New Fields through Advanced Research (Power) = Creation of New Industries\" will think of their own research and express their opinions on what issues need to be addressed in order to \"create new fields and their social implementation through their own specialized technology\"\n\nSchedule, time, venue and lecturers:【4th period…14:45-16:15, 5th period…16:30-18:00 / Fuchu… Lecture hall #1 (1講)-23, Koganei…L1342】\nJune 10, 4th period (Koganei): Prof. Tomoko Yoshio (WISE Vice director), Div.
