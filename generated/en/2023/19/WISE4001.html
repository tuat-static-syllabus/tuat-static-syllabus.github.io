The program will also develop the ability to communicate with stakeholders and to implement solutions.\n\nBy gaining practical skills and work experience as engineers and researchers in Japan and abroad, the participants will gain confidence in their ability to apply their knowledge in diverse environments and cultivate the flexibility to respond flexibly. In addition, the participants will recognize how their research fields are (or could be) utilized in the field, and utilize them to build their visions.\n\nThis course allows students to apply for credits based on their own activities. Students may apply for credit (transfer) for this course if they have their own activities, courses in their own majors, or courses taken in other majors that provide the course content, study hours, targeted achievement standards, and acquired competencies of this course. You may also take advantage of opportunities to present at academic conferences. For details, please refer to the \"Guidelines for Credit (Transfer) Application,\" which will be provided separately.\n","expected_learning":"To integrate specialized knowledge, research results, etc. learned in graduate school with practical experience, and to clarify a sense of purpose for specialized knowledge and research.\nSpecific goals to be achieved are as follows\n　1. The students will be able to clarify issues in the application, implementation, and development of knowledge and explore the seeds of research, based on examples of how the knowledge and technologies they have learned through their studies and research have been used in real-world settings in Japan and overseas, or how their research has been implemented in society.\n　2. To raise awareness of safety and environmental concerns in domestic and international settings, and to take a pro-research stance on research ethics, morals, and responsibility.\n　3. Gain experience in discovering research needs in the real world.\n　4. In research and the realization of an ideal society, the student will understand the stakeholders surrounding the subject matter, and acquire communication, negotiation, and etiquette skills with these stakeholders of various cultures, generations, etc.\n\n","course_schedule":"This course consists of pre-study, implementation of practical training, and post-study report (report and presentation).\nTime allocation will be based on student progress.\n\n1-3 times: Preliminary study (gathering information, reviewing papers, writing a plan, etc.)\n4 to 10 times: Practical training\n11-15 times: Post-event report (report compilation, data organization, presentation, etc.)\n\nRefer to the \"Credit (Transfer) Application Guidelines\" to be provided separately.\n","prerequisites":"Willingness to learn and practice in the field at home and abroad.","texts_and_materials":"None","assessment":"Practical training (50%), report and presentation (50%)","message_from_instructor":"Discoveries at sites in the field will become seeds of new research, and connect with innovation.","course_keywords":"Domestic and international training, conference presentations, internships","office_hours":"As appropriate","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/3/2023 9:37:09 AM","name":{"id":908,"ja":"Control System","en":"Control System"},"instructor":{"id":702,"ja":"神谷 秀博, 滝山 博志, 徳山 英昭, 大橋 秀伯, 伏見 千尋, 寺田 昭彦","en":"KAMIYA Hidehiro, TAKIYAMA Hiroshi, TOKUYAMA Hideaki, OHASHI Hidenori, FUSHIMI Chihiro, TERADA Akihiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"WISE PROGRAM","category":"","department":"","semester":null,"course_type":null,"facility_affiliation":"Institute of Global Innovation Research Innovation Advancement Organization","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"None"}}
