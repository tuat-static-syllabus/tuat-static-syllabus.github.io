In practical studies, not only theoretical knowledge but also practical knowledge is important. Business administration as a practical study includes theoretical knowledge of strategy, finance, accounting, marketing, organization, etc. On the other hand, theory alone is an inexhaustible source of real-world knowledge. On the other hand, it also requires knowledge necessary for real business management, which cannot be exhausted by theory alone. This knowledge is very concrete and practical knowledge that is required in the real world, such as how to formulate strategies, make judgments and decisions under uncertain circumstances, and realize specific actions to achieve objectives. In practical studies, it is not enough to understand and analyze the problems that theoretical studies aim to solve. It is always necessary to take action to solve the problem in some concrete way. In other words, by using theoretical knowledge, one understands and analyzes the problem, and then implements it by utilizing practical knowledge.\n\nThe lecture format is based on the case method, which is used in business schools in Japan and abroad. The goal of the case method is to use cases, which are narrative descriptions of management events that have occurred in actual companies, to gain insight into possible management issues from the cases, and to try to take responsibility for decision-making and solutions to those issues. To achieve this goal, a discussion is required in which the participants of the lecture will share their various opinions.\nAfter the case discussion, there is no right answer. This is because, although problems similar to the case may arise, exactly the same problems will never arise.　In other words, unlike mathematics, there is no final correct answer to management problems. The correct answer is what each participant constructs for himself/herself through discussion.\n\nThe lecture process consists of three steps: individual preparation, group discussion, and class discussion.\nIn the individual preparation, participants read the case, make their own judgments about what the case says, what the situation is, and what the potential problems are, and come up with a plan of what they would do.　Students are encouraged to put themselves in the shoes of the characters and read the case as if they were being forced to make decisions. Naturally, the case does not contain complete information. Please understand that in actual management situations, it is impossible to make decisions with complete information.\n(2) Group Discussion: Please conduct an informal group discussion with students only.　This group is the same as the members of the group presentation in the lecture and will not change during the six months. The point of having discussions only with students participating in lectures is that it is an exercise in voicing your opinions out loud anyway. By doing so, you can learn what you are thinking and what other participants are thinking.\n(1) and (2) should be completed before the start of each lecture.\n(iii) Plenary discussion: All participants will engage in class discussion. The diversity of participants will be greater than in group discussions, and the exchange of various opinions will lead to the discovery of new issues to consider. Through these plenary discussions, the students will continually experiment with their own decision-making, making their own judgments and proposing their own actions.\n","expected_learning":"Perspectives of Knowledge and Understanding\nThe student will be able to explain the relationship between business strategy theory and technology strategy.\nUnderstand the relationship between technology strategy and environmental analysis, and be able to analyze the environment.\nUnderstand and explain the process of developing and implementing technology strategy.\nUnderstand and explain the evaluation and development of technology strategy.\nPerspectives of Thinking and Judgment\nTo be able to analyze and explain issues and problems in business strategy and technology strategy from various perspectives using knowledge and frameworks of business strategy and technology strategy in real business.\nPerspective of interest and motivation\nTo be able to apply knowledge and frameworks of technological strategy to analyze and propose solutions to technological strategic issues and problems faced by companies and organizations.\nAttitude\nTo be able to speak up with a sense of purpose and logic in class discussions.\nSkills and Expressions\nThe ability to incorporate basic knowledge, tools, and frameworks of technology strategy appropriately and effectively into reports and statements.\n","course_schedule":"1) Based on an understanding of issues related to management strategy and the corporate environment, the necessary knowledge, frameworks, tools, etc. will be explained and discussed in relation to the development and implementation of technology strategy in conjunction with case studies.\nManagement strategy and technology strategy: Technology strategy related to establishing and maintaining competitive advantageTechnology strategy and environment analysis: Analyze the uncertain future business environment and clarify the issues to be addressed by the technology strategy.\nStrategy development and implementation: Develop and implement technology strategies for the target issues.\nStrategy evaluation: Evaluate the technology strategy from various perspectives.\nDeployment of strategies: To deploy technological strategies in various ways.\n\n(2) Based on the knowledge, frameworks, and tools acquired through the lectures, students will analyze, discuss, and seek solutions to the technology strategy issues and problems faced by the companies discussed in the cases.\n\n(3) The details of the cases and materials discussed in the lectures will be uploaded to the \"moodle\" business support system.\n(3) In addition to the lectures, there will be three case group presentations and two case reports.\n　　\n01.

Therefore, participation in the case analysis preparation discussion in advance is mandatory.","texts_and_materials":"No textbook will be used. Case materials will be distributed in advance.\nEach lecture will have pre-assigned books and literature (required reading) and reference materials. The lectures will be given on the assumption that the students have read the required readings in advance.\nThe contents of the required readings are positioned as prerequisite knowledge for the class.\nIn the lectures, we will set up our own questions based on this prerequisite knowledge, and we would like to deepen the discussion with the students on questions that have no solutions.\nThere is a considerable amount of reading to be done in advance for each week, so I strongly recommend that you save up for your preparation as soon as possible after reading this syllabus.\n\n\n","assessment":"Grading Criteria: (1) Class discussion 50% (2) Report 20% (3) Group presentation 30%\nReport evaluation criteria: (1) Comprehension of class content, (2) Discussion skills, (3) Practical application skills, (4) Argumentation skills, (5) Effort in writing\nIf a student is absent more than three times, he/she will not be evaluated.\n\nGrading for online lectures will be based on class participation, quizzes, assignments, and final reports.
