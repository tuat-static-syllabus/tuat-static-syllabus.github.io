Through these activities, students will develop their skills in trend analysis, benchmarking, etc.\n＜Applied Development Program\nUsing the industrial technology field related to the \"thesis theme\" of each student as a case study, research and analyze the status of conventional technology development and R&D based on theses, journals, exhibitions, company interviews, and so on.\nThe students investigate and analyze the status of conventional technological development and research and development based on dissertations, journals, exhibitions, company interviews, and so on.\nBased on the results, the novelty and usefulness of their own theme will be clarified and reflected in their dissertation. This will enable students to predict trends in technological fields and develop future plans and benchmarking skills.\nThis program is designed to cultivate the ability to predict trends in technological fields and plan for the future, as well as benchmarking skills.\n＜Business Management Program\nThe students will investigate and analyze the actual conditions of research and development and commercialization by taking up examples of research and development and commercialization at specific companies and institutions related to their \"research project proposal\" or \"dissertation theme\" as cases.\nThe students will investigate and analyze the actual conditions of research and development and commercialization. Based on the results, the students will clarify the superiority and positioning of the conception and content of their own themes, and reflect them in their proposals. Through this process, students will develop the ability to predict trends in research and development toward commercialization and to formulate future plans, as well as benchmarking skills.\n＜Business Trial Program\nThe students will investigate and analyze the actual conditions of R&D and commercialization by taking up as cases examples of R&D and commercialization at specific companies and institutions related to the \"research project proposal\" or \"dissertation theme\".\nThe students will investigate and analyze the actual conditions of research and development and commercialization. Based on the results, students will clarify the superiority, novelty, business model, and business potential of the idea and content of their own theme, and reflect them in their proposal or dissertation.\nThrough this process, students will develop the ability to predict trends in business development and formulate business plans for commercialization.\n\n","expected_learning":"Students will acquire the ability to conduct research and analysis.\nPerspectives on the diploma policy of this subject: C","course_schedule":"1st Orientation\n2ndDetermination of survey policy\n3rdDevelopment of research plan\n4th~13th\nReport on the status of the survey (Students will report on the progress of their own survey under the guidance of the instructor, conduct a literature review, make a presentation, and have a discussion).\n(Students will report on the progress of their own research under the guidance of the instructor.
