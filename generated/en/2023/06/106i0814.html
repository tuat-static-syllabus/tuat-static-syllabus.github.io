We will analyze some traditional BPs formats to understand the structure, meaning, and writing tips. Without such knowledge, prevalence of new ideas and technology or development of economy will not be achieved; commercialization of technology and ideas is a process that presents many challenges to overcome not only for individuals but also companies.\nIn the past, this was a group work with a concrete company, but as a special measure this year, this course will be developed focusing on individual work without the cooperation of companies. In the first half, you will learn the knowledge and ideas necessary for BP creation in a lecture format. In the second half, each person creates a BP that systematically summarizes what kind of products will be used as a starting point based on research content and technology and what kind of people will benefit (who are the customers) I will do it.\nEspecially in the strategic part, we will develop into a large-scale, evolutionary and dreamy BP that does not fit in the ordinary BP.\nThis subject is taught by a teacher with practical experience.","expected_learning":"・ Understand the concepts of marketing, resource analysis, competitive advantage, business model, return on investment, implementation system, etc.\n・ Understand how to mobilize the experience learned in the major to challenge various management issues and create new ideas.\n・ Please refer to the curriculum map of course registration.","course_schedule":"1st [Orientation] Lecture plan explanation, BPs introduction, Self-introduction, etc.\n2nd [Lecture] Product out / Market in, Value chain concept, Confirmation test, etc.\n3rd [Lecture] What is intellectual property right, How to use intellectual property right, Confirmation test, etc.\n4th [Lecture] How to create ideas, Business model concept, Initiative and entry barriers, Confirmation test, etc.\nFifth [Lecture] Investment return, Financial planning, Implementation system, Confirmation test, etc.\nThe 6th [Lecture] Business plan case analysis, Strategic element thinking, Confirmation test, etc.\nPart 7 [Individual work] Thinking about strategic business plans <1>, From technology to business\n8th [Individual work] <Part 1> Announcement\nThe 9th [Individual work] <Part 1> Announcement, Feedback, Way of thinking, etc.\n10th [Individual work] Thinking about strategic business plan <2>, From market to research\nThe 11th [Individual work] <Part 2> Announcement\nThe 12th [Individual work, summary] <Part 2> Announcement, Feedback, BPs summary","prerequisites":"・ In addition to class hours, prepare and review according to the standard hours of the University.\n・ Students interested in new product development, new business launch, etc.\n・ Engineers who want to improve their management sense","texts_and_materials":"・ In principle, distribute at class.\n","assessment":"BP content 60%, confirmation tests and reports 30%, attendance, remarks, class cooperation (proactiveness, cooperation), etc. 10%","message_from_instructor":"Thinking of BPs is to be aware of who in society the research and technology in which they are involved will benefit.
