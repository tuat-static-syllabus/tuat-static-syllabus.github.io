In this lecture, students will learn the theory and practice of problem solving in various production management situations. In production management, we will cover the historical transition of management techniques, production planning and control methodologies, inventory theory and control methods, various scheduling theories and methods (production scheduling, delivery scheduling, project scheduling), Theory of Constraints (TOC), Supply Chain Management (SCM), and customer value. Customer value and other topics will be covered.\n\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)","expected_learning":"<Goals and Objectives\nTo understand the basics of inventory management, production management, and supply chain management.\n(2) To acquire basic knowledge and skills that contribute to effective efficiency in production management.","course_schedule":"Lecture 1: Introduction (What is production and manufacturing?)\nLecture 2: Process Analysis of Development and Production\nLecture 3: Products and Processes (Taylor,)\nLecture 4: Products and Processes (Ford)\nLecture 5: Products and Processes (Japanese Production and Toyota)\nLecture 6: 4Ps and QCD\nLecture 7: Cost and Productivity Management and Improvement (Cost Control, Just In Time)\nLecture 8: Delivery and Process Control\nLecture 9: Production Management\nLecture 10: Equipment Management\nLecture 11: Inventory Control and Supply Chain Management\nLecture 12: Theory of Crude (TOC)\nLecture 13: Quality Control and Improvement\nLecture 14: Safety Management\nLecture 15: Overseas Factory Management\n","prerequisites":"NONE","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"The following grades will be given for attendance of 70% or more.\n\nGrading Methods and Grading Criteria for Online Education\nThe grading method for online education is based on the assumption that all attendance is\nThe grading method for online education is based on attendance, interactive learning, quizzes and assignments, online tests, reports, etc., and is based on the standardized grading system established by the University.\nThe evaluation method for online education is based on attendance, interactive learning motivation, quizzes and assignments, online tests, reports, etc.\nThe evaluation is based on the following ratio.
