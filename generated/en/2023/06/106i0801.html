The reason why people create organizations is to create added value that cannot be achieved alone. The first thing organizations should do to create \"new added value\" is to establish a \"will,\" which means \"vision.\" On the other hand, an organization is a complex system. When people operate organizations, they need to gain a perspective that overlooks the entire complex system and make decisions based on a holistic perspective for optimal outcomes. Therefore, it is important to develop an overviewing thinking ability, which means \"seeing the forest for the trees,\" to consider the entire system. In this course, we will learn about predicting changes in the external environment, ambidextrous management, knowledge creation theory, and the basics of new business development processes from the perspective of creating \"new added value\" organizations.\n\n[Lecture Objectives]\nThis lecture aims to deepen understanding of various theories from three perspectives: individual level (first-person), interpersonal level (second-person), and organizational level (third-person). In addition, through individual and group work provided during the lecture, students will further enhance their understanding.","expected_learning":"1.
