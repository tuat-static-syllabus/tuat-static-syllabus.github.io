Originality is required in project-based learning (PBL) in graduate school education, and in PBL at BASE, by incorporating the philosophy of integrating agriculture and engineering, which are the strengths and characteristics of BASE, and the diversity of research into PBL, While aiming to develop human resources in the sciences who can independently and cooperatively tackle global issues such as energy, the environment, and food, we are conscious that students will be able to engage in research and study at the graduate school with an independent and active attitude. The purpose is to promote habituation of thinking and behavior.\n\nPBL is carried out as follows.\n1) Team building\n2) Organizing project issues (understanding the current situation, setting goals)\n3) Analysis of issues (collection, organization and analysis of information)\n4) Thinking about solutions (planning, way of thinking, verification of ideas)\n5) Results presentation (presentation, review)\nIn order to acquire these individual techniques, three lectures and exercises will be held.\n\nLearn the methods and ideas that are considered necessary for implementing PBL through classroom lectures and practical training.\n\nClass code: ginc4jn","expected_learning":"It is necessary for the students to acquire the methods and ways of thinking that are considered necessary for implementing PBL.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps for BASE.","course_schedule":"Through lectures (lectures) and exercises (group work), students acquire the knowledge and techniques that form the basis of Problem-Solving Seminars II and III, which will be offered in the 3rd semester.
