Originality is required in project-based learning (PBL) in graduate school education, and in PBL at BASE, by incorporating the philosophy of integrating agriculture and engineering, which are the strengths and characteristics of BASE, and the diversity of research into PBL, While aiming to develop human resources in the sciences who can independently and cooperatively tackle global issues such as energy, the environment, and food, we are conscious that students will be able to engage in research and study at the graduate school with an independent and active attitude. The purpose is to promote habituation of thinking and behavior.\n\nPBL is carried out as follows.\n1) Team building\n2) Organizing project issues (understanding the current situation, setting goals)\n3) Analysis of issues (collection, organization and analysis of information)\n4) Thinking about solutions (planning, way of thinking, verification of ideas)\n5) Results presentation (presentation, review)\nIn order to acquire these individual techniques, three lectures and exercises will be held, but in this lecture, the following will be tackled through group work.\n\nSocial implementation of research: Practices (group work) are conducted with the aim of developing and using the research that has been conducted so far, such as graduation thesis, in social and corporate activities. Students will acquire basic practical skills such as facilitation and team building by having each group introduce their research to each other, determine seeds, come up with ideas, and prepare and present presentations. Think about social implementation based on the fusion of two or more researches.\n\nInterim and final presentations will be made, and cross-reviews will be conducted among students (between groups).tical training.","expected_learning":"It is necessary for the students to acquire the basic practical skills that are considered necessary for conducting PBL.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps for BASE.","course_schedule":"2 classes a day (Tuesday/Friday 3rd and 4th period) 4 weeks intensive\n　1st Guidance/Grouping and Lecture (Outside Lecturer: Social Implementation of Research, Professor Kanehashi @ Graduate School of Engineering, etc.)\n　Second self-introduction/research introduction\n　The third brainstorming\n　4th Seed selection/project design\n　The 5th information gathering\n　6th planning/planning, information organization\n7th presentation preparation\n8th presentation preparation\n9th Interim Presentation/Mutual Review\n10th Examination and response to the pointed out items\n11th presentation preparation\n12th presentation preparation\nThe 13th final presentation (whole)\nThe 14th final presentation (whole)\nLesson 15 Summary and self-evaluation, feedback from teachers and other groups","prerequisites":"In addition to the 30 hours of class time, it is necessary to do preparatory study and review for the standard number of hours set by the university.","texts_and_materials":"No texts are required.","assessment":"The score is based on submitted reports from the students.\n\nGrade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation:\n- S: 90 points or more,\n- A: 80 or more and less than 90 points,\n- B: 70 or more and less than 80 points,\n- C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"PBL","office_hours":"Contact each professor who gives each lecture by e-mail.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/3/2023 2:45:37 PM","name":{"id":705,"ja":"先進情報工学実験Ⅱ","en":"Frontier Information Engineering ExperimentsⅡ"},"instructor":{"id":306,"ja":"帖佐 直, 松本 武, 東城 清秀","en":"CHOSA Tadashi, MATSUMOTO Takeshi, TOJO Seishu"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering(Master)","category":"thesis research and other related studies","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Institute of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
