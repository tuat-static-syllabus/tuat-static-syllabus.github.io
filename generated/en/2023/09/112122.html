Therefore, this method is used in various fields. Many of the optimization problems in the world are combinatorial optimization problems. It is important to understand various combinatorial problems and learn how to solve them. In this course, students will learn how to solve linear programming (LP) problems, which are most important in mathematical programming, and deepen their understanding of how to solve various combinational optimization problems. Students will also practice solving optimization problems on their own Excel solvers, etc., and give presentations on their analysis results.\n\nThis course corresponds to the specialized applied courses of the curriculum of the Department of Bio-Functions and Systems Science.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n- understand how to solve linear programming and combinatorial optimization problems,\n- set up and solve your own optimization problems\n\n","course_schedule":"1.
