In this lecture we describe phenomena in a mathematical forms. By solving exercises in each class, you can understand basics of modeling. We investigated some practical topics such as momentum flux and catalyst reaction with mass transfer. We have studied some practical problems related to the momentum and surface reactions of mass transfer catalysts, and so on.","expected_learning":"Understanding the foundations of mathematical modeling and learn the latest progress of the development to the fundamentals of manufacturing technology of new energy and clean energy development.","course_schedule":"9-12.
