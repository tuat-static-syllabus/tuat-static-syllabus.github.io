Originality is required in project-based learning (PBL) in graduate school education, and in PBL at BASE, by incorporating the philosophy of integrating agriculture and engineering, which are the strengths and characteristics of BASE, and the diversity of research into PBL, While aiming to develop human resources in the sciences who can independently and cooperatively tackle global issues such as energy, the environment, and food, we are conscious that students will be able to engage in research and study at the graduate school with an independent and active attitude. The purpose is to promote habituation of thinking and behavior.\n\nPBL is carried out as follows.\n1) Team building\n2) Organizing project issues (understanding the current situation, setting goals)\n3) Analysis of issues (collection, organization and analysis of information)\n4) Thinking about solutions (planning, way of thinking, verification of ideas)\n5) Results presentation (presentation, review)\nIn order to acquire these individual techniques, three lectures and exercises will be held, but in this lecture, the following will be tackled through group work.\n\n・Social problem solving: Conduct group work aimed at solving regional and corporate problems.\n・Collection of actual issues/problems (external interviews)\n・Summarize the quantification of issues, ideas, feasibility, etc. for problem solving\n・Aim to improve presentation skills\n・In addition to group work techniques, acquire practical skills in social activities through logical thinking, organizing problems, numerical processing, etc.\n\n\nMake a final presentation and conduct a cross-review between students (between groups).","expected_learning":"It is necessary for the students to acquire the basic practical skills that are considered necessary for conducting PBL.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps for BASE.","course_schedule":"2 classes a day (Tuesday/Friday 3rd and 4th period) 4 weeks intensive\n　1st Guidance/Grouping (Regional Revitalization Story, Professor Fukui)\n　Second issue determination (preparation) and consideration of problems\n　The 3rd examination of problems\n4th project design\n　The 5th information collection, information organization\n　6th planning/planning, decision of interview items\n7th external interview period\n8th external interview period\n9th external interview period\n10th external interview period\nThe 11th presentation preparation (class + α)\nPresentation practice (team + instructor)\n12th Presentation preparation (class + α)\nThe 13th presentation preparation (class + α)\n14th Final Presentation (Overall) (Presentation is assumed to be held in the afternoon of December 22, 10 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for Q&A)\n(15th Summary and self-evaluation)","prerequisites":"In addition to the 30 hours of class time, it is necessary to do preparatory study and review for the standard number of hours set by the university.","texts_and_materials":"No texts are required.","assessment":"The score is based on submitted reports from the students.\n\nGrade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation:\n- S: 90 points or more,\n- A: 80 or more and less than 90 points,\n- B: 70 or more and less than 80 points,\n- C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"PBL","office_hours":"Contact each professor who gives each lecture by e-mail.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/3/2023 2:48:21 PM","name":{"id":699,"ja":"アルゴリズム序論演習","en":"Algorithms : Laboratory Exercises"},"instructor":{"id":308,"ja":"浅井 和美","en":"ASAI Kazumi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering(Master)","category":"thesis research and other related studies","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Institute of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
