With respect to these biological, physical and chemical factors that harm plants, we clarify the various properties, related factors, mutual relationships with plants, etc. so as to safely and reliably control plant diseases It is expected to connect. In this lecture, three members of the Biological Control Sciences Division, Ariyoshi, Inoue and Kasahara, studied physiological and ecological studies on environmental stress such as phytopathogenic microorganisms, pests / nematodes, weeds, high temperature and salt, , Evolution, molecular biology, recent trends in genomic chemical analysis research, purpose of research, how to design a research plan based on experiment results, relatively new technologies available for research, mechanisms and advantages of failure control technology ・ Shows specific research cases and global research trends about disadvantages, etc.","expected_learning":"I am interested in what kind of work is being done in the research of the leading edge of biological control science, understand the following and be able to discuss.\n(1) Understanding of advanced research such as physiology, ecology, evolution, molecular biology, genome science\n(2) Understanding the purpose of the research, recent trends, how to set up research plans\n\nIn addition to the lesson time of 30 hours and the above-mentioned lesson learning time, using the text to be distributed in the lesson, materials to be posted on HP and moodle, prepare and review according to the standard number of the university\n\nAs a viewpoint of the diploma policy, please refer to the following curriculum map of HPU (Three Policies).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"From the viewpoints of physiology, ecology, evolution, molecular biology, genome science, biological interaction etc. from the viewpoint of research at the leading edge of biological control science, research purpose, recent trend, research plan We introduce research cases and global research trends on how to set up, relatively new technologies, mechanisms of disease control technology, advantages and disadvantages, and so on.\n(* Kasahara, ** Inoue, *** Arie)　Partial intensive courses scheduled.\nPart 1: Plant development and its regulation by plant hormones *\nPart 2: Plant adaptation to environment and its regulation by plant hormones (1): auxin *\nPart 3: Plant adaptation to environment and its regulation by plant hormones (2): gibberellin, abscisic acid *\nPart 4: Plant adaptation to environment and its regulation by plant hormones (3): strigolactone, peptide hormones *\nPart 5: Plant protection: herbicides, plant growth regulators, etc. *\nPart 6: Research and serendipity (1): The Great flower evolution **\nPart 7: Research and serendipity (2): Nepotism **\nPart 8: Research and serendipity (3): From geocentric theory to heliocentric theory **\nPart 9: Research and serendipity (4): Search the entomopathogenic virus **\nPart10: Research and serendipity (5): From miasma theory to Germ theory of disease **\nPart11: Basics of plant disease control/Scientific understanding ***\nPart12: Chemical control of plant diseases (1): Mechanism of control by fungicidal fungicides ***\nPart13: Chemical control of plant diseases (2): Mechanism of control by non-fungicidal fungicides ***\nPart14: Physical control of plant diseases / cultivation control of plant diseases ***\nPart15: Biocontrol of plant diseases ***\n","prerequisites":"In addition to the lectures in the class, you are recommended to prepare and review the class using the standard amount of time as specified by the university for each class.\nBefore studying this lecture, it is desirable to review the relationships such as \"plant pathology\", \"plant physiology\", \"biological control\" and so on.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Each teacher assigns a report, exam, or quiz (detailed explanations given by each teacher at the first class) to give a score of 100.
