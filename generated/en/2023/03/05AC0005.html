In this lecture, we will introduce and discuss about the principale and impact of revolutionary technology in animal science such as whole genome sequencing and informatics.\n(Aoki); Animal production science plays an important role to develop production technologies and to resolve problems facing dairy farms. In this lecture, I will introduce recent research topics relating to 1) smart dairy farming, 2) domestic production of concentrate feed, and 3) cross breeding systems for dairy cows, to discuss the solving the problems on dairy farms.\n(Arai); Each organ such as brain, liver and kidney is composed of several different cells. These cells are differentiated from a fertilized egg, then acquired the specific function during several developmental stage. In this lecture, the mechanism of cellular proliferation and differentiation with particular reference to characterization of undifferentiated stem cell including iPSC will be introduced.","expected_learning":"Recent animal science will be understood in lecture.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1.
