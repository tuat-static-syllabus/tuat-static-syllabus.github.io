The lecture also provides students with the knowledge needed to develop solutions for research on applied life sciences.\n\nThis lecture introduces the latest knowledge of protein crystallography and some structures of enzymes, glycobiology, genetic modified organisms (GMOs) and genome edited organisms (GEOs), and research on filamentous fungi and its application. In the lecture, PowerPoint software is mainly used for a clear indication of the key points.\n","expected_learning":"- Understanding the latest knowledge of protein structure analysis and structures of some enzymes.\n- Understanding the latest knowledge of glycobiology.\n- Understanding the latest knowledge and applications of GMOs and GEOs.\n- Understanding the latest knowledge of research on eukaryotic microorganisms (mainly filamentous fungi) and its application, and acquiring skills in the development of research.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: (A) and (D)\nPlease refer to the curriculum map at the following URL:\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/.\n","course_schedule":"Omnibus/16 periods total\n\nTakashi Tonozuka (4 periods)\n- The lecture provides an overview and methods of protein X-ray crystallography. The lecture also introduces properties and three-dimensional structures of enzymes acting on carbohydrates, which are useful in the field of agricultural and food sciences.\n\n1. Enzymes acting on starch and related carbohydrates\n2. Enzymes acting on plant biomass\n3. What is the protein X-ray crystallography?\n4. Methods of the protein X-ray crystallography\n\nYouhei Yamagata (4 periods)\n- The lecture introduces molecular biology of eukaryotic microorganisms (mainly filamentous fungi), which has recently made a great advance, from a classical fermentation study to recent knowledge of growth, and production of useful substances.\n\n4. Eukaryotic microorganisms used in brewing and fermentation (1)\n5. Eukaryotic microorganisms used in brewing and fermentation (2)\n6. Relationship between proteolytic enzymes and synthesis of cell walls and membranes in filamentous fungi (1)\n7. Relationship between proteolytic enzymes and synthesis of cell walls and membranes in filamentous fungi (2)\n\nShinya Kawai (4 periods)\n- Many genetically modified crops are commercially cultivated. We will learn backgrounds and principles of GMOs and New Plant Biotechnologies for GEOs, Chimeric REpressor Gene Silencing and flowering stimulant by ASLV, FT and TFL, and etc.\n\n8. Plant transformation methods: (1) Methods of gene introduction to nuclei\n9. Plant transformation methods: (2) Plastid transformation and plant virus vectors\n10. Genome editing methods (ZFNs and CRISPR-Cas9) and New Plant Biotechnology\n11. Applications and statistics of Genetically Modified Crops\n\nMizuki Tanaka (4 periods)\n-Microorganisms regulate the expression level of individual genes in response to the external environment, such as nutrient sources.\nThis lecture introduces the regulatory mechanism of gene expression in eukaryotic microorganisms, especially the regulation of hydrolytic enzyme gene expression in filamentous fungi.\n\n13. Transcriptional induction of hydrolysis genes\n14. Transcriptional repression by carbon catabolite repression\n15. Effects of codon bias on gene expression level\n16. Regulation of gene expression levels by endoplasmic reticulum stress response\n","prerequisites":"This lecture is an elective subject in the category of the specialized subject.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture.\n","texts_and_materials":"Handouts (paper and/or electronic) will be provided if needed.","assessment":"Performance in lecture (30% total), report assignment or examination given by each instructor (70% total)\n\n","message_from_instructor":"We hope that this lecture will help you on your research in the future.","course_keywords":"Protein structure, glycobiology, GMO and GEO, filamentous fungi","office_hours":"Questions can be asked after class, or please request an appointment by email.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/16/2023 10:20:25 AM","name":{"id":484,"ja":"知的財産権","en":"Intellectual Property"},"instructor":{"id":465,"ja":"上野 智雄","en":"UENO Tomo"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Thu.1～2","references":"Biochemistry (Trudy McKee and James R.
