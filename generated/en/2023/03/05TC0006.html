Then, it is discussed that the history of international cooperation and consensus building on how to share the earth observation results obtained by various sensors on a global scale and tackle global environmental problems worldwide. In addision, in order to grasp the environmental impact on a regional scale temporally, spatially, and quantitatively, we will deepenly understand by reviewing past research, etc. about the collection and analysis methods of various spatial information necessary for problem solving and countermeasures.\nAfter that, each student will decide the theme of environmental problems and countermeasures on a regional or global scale, and thinks about the role and applicability of remote sensing technology through discussions with the students.","expected_learning":"To understand various sensor technologies and satellite remote sensing used in the agricultural field.\nTo understand the history of international earth observation efforts and consensus building.\nTo understand the role of remote sensing in various environmental problems.\n\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )","course_schedule":"1.
