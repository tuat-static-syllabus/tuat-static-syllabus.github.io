In particular, the course will focus on photosynthetic reactions, which are the unique metabolic pathways in plants, and introduce research from basic to applied research. In addition, an efficient production system in the plant factories will be introduced based on the understanding of the environmental responses of crops.","expected_learning":"Can explain the basics about areas closely related to primary production in plants.","course_schedule":"1) light absorption and photosynthetic electron transfer, 2) stomatal opening and closing, 3) carbon fixation and photorespiration, and 4) plant production in plant factories.","prerequisites":"None in particular","texts_and_materials":"Textbook: Not specified.\nPrinted copies (or PDF files) will be distributed.\n","assessment":"Report=50%, Class participation=50%","message_from_instructor":"My laboratory conducts research to elucidate the mechanisms of environmental response in crops and to improve crop productivity. In particular, we are developing research on the enhancement of primary production capacity based on photosynthesis. I am also conducting research for developing efficient crop cultivation technologies in plant factories based on an understanding of the environmental response of crops. During this lecture, I would like to introduce some recent research trends as well.\nI hope you will feel free to attend the lecture.\nWataru Yamori yamori@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp\nLaboratory homepage: http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/yamori-lab/\n","course_keywords":"Crop production, environmental response, photosynthesis, stomata, electron transfer, respiration, plant factory","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/19/2023 4:56:16 PM","name":{"id":2706,"ja":"生物生産科学特論(植物系）Ⅰ","en":"Special Lecture on Agricultural Production Sciences (plant production) Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":2513,"ja":"安達 俊輔","en":"ADACHI Shunsuke"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":1,"min":1,"max":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"2nd","course_type":"2nd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"Crop Science","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
