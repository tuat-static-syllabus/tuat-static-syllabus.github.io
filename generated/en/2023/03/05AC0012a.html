In particular, the course will focus on photosynthetic reactions, which are the unique metabolic pathways in plants, and introduce research from basic to applied research. In addition, an efficient production system in the plant factories will be introduced based on the understanding of the environmental responses of crops.","expected_learning":"Can explain the basics about areas closely related to primary production in plants.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.

In particular, we are developing research on the enhancement of primary production capacity based on photosynthesis. I am also conducting research for developing efficient crop cultivation technologies in plant factories based on an understanding of the environmental response of crops. During this lecture, I would like to introduce some recent research trends as well.\nI hope you will feel free to attend the lecture.\nWataru Yamori yamori@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp\nLaboratory homepage: http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/yamori-lab/\n","course_keywords":"Crop production, environmental response, photosynthesis, stomata, electron transfer, respiration, plant factory","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/4/2023 11:41:53 PM","name":{"id":455,"ja":"動物園動物学","en":"Zoo and Wild Animal Medicine"},"instructor":{"id":445,"ja":"宇佐見 英美子","en":"USAMI Emiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":1,"min":1,"max":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Veterinary Clinic","office":null,"day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
