On the other hand, reduction in the chemical fertilizer use is needed. The purpose of this lecture is to acquire basic knowledge about techniques for improving the crop nutrition using soil microorganisms or plant functions.\nTo reduce the chemical fertilizer use, it is conceivable to improve nutrient availability or to supply organic matter as nutrients instead of chemical fertilizers. In order to improve nutrient availability in soil or organic matter, it has been suggested that the function of soil microorganisms or plant can be useful. In this lecture, the factors affecting nutrient availability and the function of soil microorganisms to improve it will be explained.\nThis is part of the Agricultural Production Sciences course of Special Field subjects.","expected_learning":"1. Understand why only a part of the nutrient applied is used by the crop.\n2. Can give examples and explained the mechanisms of biological functions to improve nutrient availability.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/)","course_schedule":"1. Factors affecting fertilizer utilization by crops\n2. Improvement of crop P uptake through proliferated soil symbiotic fungi\n3. Nutrient supply by the reduction in N and K leaching and improvement of biological P parameters through the introduction of green manure\n4. Effect of organic farming on soil microorganisms and nutrient cycle in the soil","prerequisites":"In addition to class hours, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Do not use texts or textbooks.
