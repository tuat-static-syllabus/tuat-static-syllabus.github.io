Since the resources used for production are limited, agriculture, like other industries, is required to improve productivity. Despite this, small-scale family farming is still the mainstay of agricultural production in many parts of the world, including Japan. In addition to the fact that farmland and water, which are essential resources for agricultural production, are difficult to move, family farming is influenced by local customs and culture, and conversely plays an important role in the formation of these customs and culture.\n\nThe objectives of this course are: 1) to study the interrelationship between agriculture and economic development, 2) the theory of family farming, and 3) the interrelationship between family farming and customs and culture, and to deepen our knowledge of the characteristics of agriculture in comparison with other industries, and to develop the ability to consider and analyze sustainable agricultural development from multiple perspectives.\n\nThis subject is one of the fundamental subjects of the Graduate School of Agriculture and is positioned in the curriculum as a subject that approaches the sustainable development of agriculture from the viewpoint of social science, especially economics.","expected_learning":"1. to understand the characteristics of agriculture in terms of the interrelationships between agriculture and economic development, and between agriculture and customs and culture\n2. to be able to relate one's own interests to the literature by understanding the recent research trends in related fields.\n\nPlease refer to the curriculum map of course guidance.\nURL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"The class introduce resent literature on each topic, followed by discussion.\n\n1) Introduction: Agriculture and Economic Development\n2) Technological Development of Agriculture and Economic Environment\n3) Disparities in Productivity and Scales\n4) Theory of Family Farming\n5) Family and Agricultural Production (1) Adoption of Technology\n6) Family and agricultural production (2) Culture and custom\n7) Culture and customs of agricultural origin\n8) General Discussion\n\nThis course will be conducted in-person.\nThe content of the course is subject to change depending on the knowledge and interest of the students and the progress of the class.\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 15 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and review the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University, using the materials as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"The materials will be distributed in class or in Google Classroom.","assessment":"Class participation (70%) and Term paper (30%)\n\nThe term paper will evaluate the understanding of existing literature and ability to summarize it.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Agriculture, Economic Development, Technological Development, Family Farming, Culture and Customs","office_hours":"Right after each lecture or by appointment through E-mail upon request.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/27/2023 3:23:13 PM","name":{"id":480,"ja":"現代宗教論","en":"Religion Studies"},"instructor":{"id":460,"ja":"榊原 保志, 生嶋 健司","en":"SAKAKIBARA Yasushi, IKUSHIMA Kenji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Otsuka, K. and Fan, S. eds.
