Knowledge on genetic algorithm is preferable.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (30 ours).\n\nAkasaka class: students are required to have basic knowledge on generalized linear models. Ordination analyses, and programming in R environment. Students are required to take ‘Exercise for Methods of Agricultural Experimental design and Statistical Analysis I’ which is offered in the same semester.
