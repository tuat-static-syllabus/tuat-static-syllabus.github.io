The following is an overview of the two instructors.\n\n1) Dr. Mitsuhiro Miyazawa\nLiving organisms have evolved by acquiring functions that use light. Typical examples are photosynthesis in plants, which involves the absorption of visible light, and the acquisition of vision in animals. In some species, we have succeeded in creating structural colors using light interference. Some species of arthropods have even acquired polarization functions. In this lecture, the properties of various electromagnetic waves will be summarized, and the relationship between living organisms and light will be explained from the viewpoint of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic waves.\n\n2) Dr. Shinnya Fujii\nThis class provides students with the basis of pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. Medicinal chemistry is an interdisciplinary scientific field related to multiple research areas such as organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, structural biology and informatics. In this class, we learn about the road of drug discovery by focusing on the structure and function of biologically active compounds, as well as about current status and issues of low-molecular-weight pharmaceutics. We also learn about the basis of chemical biology used for drug discovery.","expected_learning":"1) Dr. Mitsuhiro Miyazawa\nTo be able to reconsider the functions and traits of living organisms from the viewpoint of the effects of materials and light, and to think about new technologies and applications of resource materials.\n\n2) Dr. Shinnya Fujii\nThe standard of this lecture is to understand the basis of medicinal chemistry, strategy and tactics of drug discovery.\n","course_schedule":"1) Dr. Mitsuhiro Miyazawa\nThe following topics will be explained in an intensive 2 or 3 days lecture.\n(1) General properties of electromagnetic waves - characteristics and uses of gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible rays, near-chromatic rays, infrared rays, etc.\n(2) Absorption of light, animal vision and effects of pigments\n(3) Light wave interference and the mechanism of structural play produced by living organisms\n(4) Polarization of light and the mechanism of polarization in arthropods.\n(5) The mechanism of fluorescence and bioluminescence in fish and amphibians.\n\n2) Dr. Shinnya Fujii\nDay 1: Overview of medicinal chemistry\nDay 2 (and 3): Strategy and tactics of drug discovery, current status and issues of low-molecular-weight pharmaceutics.","prerequisites":"This class is opened for graduate students.\n\nIn addition to the 30 hours of class time, students are required to refer to the lecture materials and reference books distributed to them, and to do prior and post-work study equivalent to the standard number of hours at the university.","texts_and_materials":"None","assessment":"1) Dr. Mitsuhiro Miyazawa (50%)\nThe report prepared during the lecture time (referring to your own notebook) will be evaluated.\n\n2) Dr. Shinnya Fujii (50%)\nAttitude in class (25%), Report (25%)","message_from_instructor":"1) Dr. Mitsuhiro Miyazawa\nLet's think about the fact that various properties of light are always involved in our casual, everyday lives.","course_keywords":"Electromagnetic waves, properties of light, biological functions, medicinal chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, chemical biology, biologically active compounds, drug discovery","office_hours":"After lecture","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/27/2023 8:31:33 PM","name":{"id":475,"ja":"野生動物学","en":"Wild Animal Medicine"},"instructor":{"id":419,"ja":"佐藤 至（岩）, 藤川 浩","en":"SATOU Itaru, FUJIKAWA Hiroshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":null,"office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"1) Dr. Mitsuhiro Miyazawa\nDuring the lecture, some relevant recent original papers will be introduced.\n\n2) Dr. Shinnya Fujii\nThe Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, 4th Edition, C.
