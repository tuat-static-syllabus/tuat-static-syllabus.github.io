This course learns such a relationship between biogeochemical cycles and environmental issues, and how such a biogeochemical cycling is characterized.","expected_learning":"Diploma policy:\nRefer to curriculum map on the HP of our university\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"Specifically, the following contents are planned.\n\n[Umezawa] (6 or 7 lectures and/or lab works from October to November)\nThe basics of stable isotope ratio, an essential tool for understanding biogeochemical cycles in the biosphere, will be lectured introducing the application studies in the field of ecology, hydrology and environmental sciences. Furthermore, participants will also experience C and N stable isotopes analyses including sample processing.\n\n\nSession 1: How to tackle with English as graduate school student?\nSession 2: Basics of stable isotopes, applications of stable isotopes in ecology\nSession 3: Application of stable isotopes in hydrology and environmental science\nSession 4: Practice 1: Discussion on food web analysis using stable isotopes\nSession 5: Practice 2: Sample processing\nSession 6: Practice 3: Sample analysis\nSession 7: Practice 4: Discussion on the results\n\n\n[Watanabe] (6 or 7 lectures from December to January)\nThe lecture will consist of two major parts, the first half of which will be a lecture-style introduction of the latest topics in environmental science by the lecturer.
