The lecture by Dr. Ozaki is focused on environmental pollution state caused by heavy metals and radioactive substances elucidated from field monitoring. Then, students will learn basic scheme of random sampling method which is an essential procedure not only for sample collection from the target field but also social survey. We will reconfirm what environmental science is and consider how we should be for that at the end of the series of the lectures. The lecture by Dr. Sato is focused on the policy of hazardous substances in Japan. Japan society experienced serious pollution problem in 1960-1970. Nowadays, we have to address many kinds of environmental risks that include uncertainty and decision making procedure. In sum, we’ll study the development of environmental policies in Japan.","expected_learning":"Dr. Ozaki: Students develop more knowledge on environmental contamination state by heavy metals and radioactive cesium in the current days. They learn the basis of random sampling as a fundamental collection skill of field samples. Students are also expected to grasp how their own research topic is placed in the associated study fields and our society.\n\nDr. Sato: To understand the development of environmental policies in Japan and the issues of environmental risk management on present days.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"This class is the omnibus style lecture conducted by the instructors.\nThe detail of the class are shown as follows;\n\nDr. Ozaki:\n(1) Environmental issues: What sort of problem is this?\n(2) Actual situation of harmful trace substances pollution (1)\n(3) Actual situation of harmful trace substances pollution (2)\n(4) How to collect samples by conventional method, how to collect samples by random sampling method\n(5) Compare the measurement results obtained from the conventional and random procedures (the previous results are used as example) by statistical software\n(6) How many samples do we need? Statistical calculation and actual implementation\n(7) Views and attitudes toward environmental science\n\nDr. Sato:\n(1) Industrialization and pollution problem in Japan (1) Water pollution / Minamata disease\n(2) Industrialization and pollution problem in Japan (2) Air pollution / Yokkaichi-asthma\n(3) Present pollution problem in Japan (1) Stock pollution / Soil contamination\n(4) Present pollution problem in Japan (2) Environmental Risks / Uncertainty\n(5) Cost benefit analysis / Cost effect analysis\n(6) Procedure of decision making / Risk communication and management\n(7) Procedure of decision making / Environmental Assessment","prerequisites":"This lecture is a specialized subject.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (30 hours).","texts_and_materials":"Dr. Ozaki: The lecture material will be distributed by the day. Google Classroom may be used.\nDr. Sato: Nothing special","assessment":"Lecture by Lecture by Dr. Ozaki (50%) and Dr. Sato (50%)\n\nDr. Ozaki & Dr. Sato: Evaluate student’s attitude in class (40%) and report (60%). The report topic will be directed during the class.","message_from_instructor":"Dr. Ozaki: It is very important to know past examples, to properly understand the actual situation on site, and to have one's own thoughts and opinion based on the relationship with associated fields and social phenomena for working on environmental issues as an expert. And let us learn the basic sample collection methods necessary for proper understanding of the actual situation.\n\nDr. Sato: We’ll study the historical development of environmental policies and address present issues of environment.","course_keywords":"Dr. Ozaki: environmental pollution, heavy metals, radioactive cesium, random sampling, environmental science; Dr. Sato: environmental pollution, harmful materials, environmental risk, risk communication, environmental impact assessment","office_hours":"By the demand","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/13/2023 1:43:56 PM","name":{"id":473,"ja":"動物衛生学","en":"Animal Health"},"instructor":{"id":416,"ja":"落合 謙爾（岩), 渋谷 淳, 吉田 敏則","en":"SHIBUTANI Makoto, YOSHIDA Toshinori"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Organization for the Advancement of Education and Global Learning","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Dr. Ozaki: Stephen Waite (2000) Statistical Ecology in Practice: A Guide to Analysing Environmental and Ecological Field Data, 440pp., Longman Group United Kingdom\n\nDr. Sato: Referring on the lecture"}}
