Hands-on experience in the difficulty of discussing implementation of academic research across different fields/disciplines (e.g., disagreement in reaching consensus regarding definition for terms or space) will probably be felt keenly by those students who participate in this course. Through this presumably uncomfortable experience students will re-evaluate each researcher’s standpoint in the body of knowledge to suggest ideas for collaborative research that takes recent developments in agriculture and rural area policies into consideration to demonstrate their final accomplishment in this course.\nThe second half of this course expounds on the roles and challenges associated with rural planning as a practice of science while referring to achievements in both research and practical support for rural development and reconstruction following the aftermath of the 2011 T?hoku earthquake and tsunami. In addition, sufficient discussion time is allowed so that students gain a deeper understanding of the course content.\n","expected_learning":"Students enrolled in this course are expected to achieve the following goals: master basic knowledge related to the Japanese Government’s policies on rural development and its history; gain insights into concrete methods and theories useful for conducting research as well as providing practical support in the areas of rural planning; and develop abilities to consider various possibilities for contributions a university can make for regional communities and our society at large.\n\nPlease refer to the Curriculum map of TUAT at\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1.
