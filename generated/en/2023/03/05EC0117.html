It is positioned as a recommended course in the field of Functional Control of Natural Resources.\n\nProf. Saito will give a lecture on fundamentals and potential applications of the cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are introduced. Cellulose nanofiber is a novel material derived from wood that weighs one-fifth of steel and be five times stronger. Approximately 180 Japanese companies are currently participating in the Nano-Cellulose Forum led by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and a new industry based on cellulose nanofibers is emerging.\n\nProf. Igarashi will give a lecture on the cutting-edge of the plant cell wall degradation by filamentous fungi. This course is positioned to acquire advanced research topics in the research field related to the master's thesis.","expected_learning":"Prof. Saito:Students study fundamental properties of preparation methods, sturcture and dispersion principle, and undearstand a current issue and their solution as well as their applicatoin.\n\nProf. Igarashi: Students understand an importance of plant biomass conversion.\nStudents understand degradation mechanism of plant cell wall.\"\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/)","course_schedule":"Prof. Saito will give lectures as follows,\n1) Structure of native cellulose\n2) Conversion to cellulose nanofibers\n3) Fundamental properties of cellulose nanofibers\n4) Composites of cellulose nanofibers\n5) Problems and their countermeasures\n\nProf. Igarashi will give lectures as follows,\nThis lecture aims to deepen understanding of the mechanisms of biomass degradation by microorganisms, which is important for the development of the biomass conversion technologies. In particular, the lecture will focus on fungi, which have excellent degrading ability, from various perspectives ranging from the protein/enzyme level to the gene/genome level.\n1)Conversion of plant biomass\n2)Biomass degradation by microorganisms\n3)Degradation by fungi (protein and enzyme level)\n4)Degradation by fungi (gene/genome level)","prerequisites":"Students are recommended to spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University","texts_and_materials":"Prof. Saito:Handouts will be given as needed\nProf. Igarashi: Handouts will be given as needed","assessment":"Prof. Saito:Assessment will be calculated according to Usual performance score and Report (50 %).\nProf. Igarashi:Assessment will be calculated according to Usual performance score and Report (50 %).","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Prof. Saito:Cellulose, nanofiber, wood biomass, structural control, characteristic expression.
