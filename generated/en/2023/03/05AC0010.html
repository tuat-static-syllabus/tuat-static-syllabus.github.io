Insects belong to diverse group of organisms and their pathogen s are also diverse. Novel approach to investigate the study of insect pathogens will be introduced in this course.\n\nDr Hiromitsu Moriyama:\nLife phenomena related to cytoplasmic genetic factors (fungal viruses / prions) involved in plant and fungal growth control are discussed based on molecular genetics and biological control perspectives.\n\nDr. Masatoshi Nakajima (The Univ. Tokyo)\nIn order to maintain growth regulation in land plants under the environments and stress conditions, plant hormones as small bioactive molecules play quite important roles during the growth.\nIn the unit of this lecture, we introduce the latest topics on the mechanisms of plant hormone signaling.\n","expected_learning":"Dr Madoka Nakai:\nTo be able to understand and discuss about characteristics of insect pathogens and novel topics of those fields.\n\nDr Hiromitsu Moriyama:\nTo be able to understand and discuss about cytoplasmic genetic factors (fungal viruses / prions) based on molecular genetics and biological control perspectives.\n\nDr. Masatoshi Nakajima (The Univ. Tokyo)\nTo be able to understand and discuss about latest topics on the mechanisms of plant hormone signaling.\n\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\n","course_schedule":"Dr Madoka Nakai:\n1. Classification of entomopathogens and the basic knowledge of insect viruses\n2. Basic knowledge to understand COVID-19\n3. Studies to overcome COVID-19\n4.
