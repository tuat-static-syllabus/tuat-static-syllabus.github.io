It is positioned as a recommended course in the field of Functional Control of Natural Resources.\n\nPaper is an environmentally friendly material that utilizes forest resources, namely, biomass. It has been manufactured since BC but is still used in large quantities on the market. This is because forest and plant resources are used to produce paper as raw materials and incorporated into the circulation of ecosystems. Due to concerns that non-circulating carbon emissions will cause climate change, the Japan has made a cabinet decision to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 46% by 2030 compared to the 2013 levels and achieve complete carbon neutrality by 2050. For this reason, each business entity is striving to replace some of its products and manufacturing processes with biomass materials such as paper. For this purpose, it is important to develop biomass utilization techniques, such as paper-biodegradable plastics composites to impart thermoplasticity, utilizing agricultural waste and unused biomass so that forest resources are not depleted, assuming that paper will be used in various phases. Examples of the development of such new biomass materials will be introduced, and the concept and application of the development will be explained.\n\n<Aoki>\n\nThe objective of this lecture is to acquire a wide range of knowledge from the basics of wood and wood-based materials to applied fields such as the use of wood in structures and to deepen consideration of the significance and effects of wood utilization.\nThis course is an intensive lecture given by Prof. Kenji Aoki of the University of Tokyo. The outline of the lecture is as follows.\n\nIn this lecture, basic knowledge of manufacturing methods and applications of various wood-based materials will be overviewed. Next, material manufacturing standards such as JAS and JIS, and the standard strengths and allowable stress required for use as structural materials for buildings will be lectured. The course then moves on to lectures on applied fields of wood utilization, such as the types and characteristics of wooden house construction methods, the background to the recent increase in medium- and large-scale wooden structures, and the latest information on technological developments.\nIt may be updated during the summer vacation.\n\n\n\n\n","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/)\n\nIn addition to the class time, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures,\nspending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts\n\n<Aoki>\nThe educational achievement of this lecture is to understand the manufacturing methods and uses of wood and wood-based materials, to learn about the latest technological developments in wooden structures, which are their greatest utilization, and to be able to explain one's own ideas for increasing the demand for wood in the future.","course_schedule":"<Enomae>\n1) History and manufacturing process of papermaking\n2) Basic properties of paper\n3) Paper-based device\n4) Mechanisms of book paper deterioration\n5) Novel biomass and energy source applied to papermaking\n\n<Aoki>\n1st Relationship between the global environment, wood, and architecture\n2nd Manufacturing and applications of wood-based materials 1 (Solid timber, Glued laminated timber, LVL, CLT)\n3rd Manufacturing and applications of wood-based materials 2 (Plywood, OSB, PB, MDF)\n4th Strength properties of wood and wood-based materials\n5th Standard strength and allowable stress of wood and wood-based materials\n6th Types and characteristics of wooden house construction\n7th Promotion of medium and large-scale wooden constructions and its background\n8th Utilization of CLT and development of medium and high-rise wooden buildings\n9th Promotion of utilization for wood in construction\n","prerequisites":"<Enomae>\nStudents are recommended to spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\n\n","texts_and_materials":"<Enomae>\nHandouts will be given as needed.\n\n<Aoki>\nPrints are distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"<Enomae>\nAssessment will be calculated according to Usual performance score and Report (50 %).\n\n<Aoki>\nA mark given for a student's class participation (50%)\nExaminations 50%\n","message_from_instructor":"<Aoki> Wooden constructions are attracting increasing attention due to growing global awareness of environmental issues.
