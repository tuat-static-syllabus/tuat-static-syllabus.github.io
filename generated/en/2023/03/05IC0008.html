Discuss the factors that influence development approach such as natural environment, available resources and population, and government and economy, and the outcomes and issues of development activities. Many of the participants are expected to have basic knowledge and experience on rural development, and to share and deepen their knowledge and insight through discussion and group projects. We also invite experts participating in our University's international contribution activities to give their special lectures. Finally, participants in groups will present their group projects on sustainable agricultural and rural development cooperation in class. Through this exercise, we will also examine the relations and differences between the development plan, and research plan taught in \"International Environmental and Agricultural Science Communication Exercise\".","expected_learning":"1) Participants will be able to make sustainable development projects for rural areas based on the conditions such as natural environment, resources and population, government and economy, etc.\n2) After clearly understanding the relations and the differences between the development planning and the research planning of agriculture and rural area, participants will be able to make rural development projects using the project design matrix.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1 Orientation: course outline, self introduction of participants\n2 Economic growth\n3 Industry structure\n4 Agriculture and rural area\n5 Education and health\n6 Institution\n7 Globalization of economy and development aid\n8 Identifying key issues in international development cooperation\n9 Planning development cooperation projects and obtaining funds\n10 Implementation and evaluation of development cooperation projects\n11 What is sustainable agriculture?\n12 Appropriate technology for sustainable regional development\n13 Development and environmental conservation\n14 Group presentation of rural development project plans I\n15 Group presentation of rural development project plans II","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours in classes and time required for completing assignments, students are recommended to prepare for and review the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references.
