Lecture 1 -6 will be the series of lectures concerning hydrology, pollutant fate and transport, pesticide monitoring and modeling. In addition, book review of “Pesticide risk assessment in rice paddies, Theory and Practice ” will be conducted. In this section (Lecture7 to 10), review presentation will be assigned to the group of students.　Lectures 11-15 provide an in-depth look at global flood risk under climate change. First, fundamental concepts and mechanisms of climate change are presented. Then we review pivotal global floods studies. In the last two lectures we use global flood models and global flood simulations to reproduce some important findings mentioned during the literature review.","expected_learning":"The pass criterion of the this course is to gain broad knowledge and concept which can be applied for water resource management, and the investigation and assessment of the environmental risk associated with the pollutants such as pesticides in the aquatic environments such as streams, rivers and lakes and paddy fields.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1.Course orientation (Watanabe), Environmental hydrology I\n2.Environmental hydrology II\n3.Environmental fate of the pollutant I\n4.Environmental fate of the pollutant II\n5.Water quality monitoring\n6.Water quality modeling\n7〜10.review and discussion of Pesticide Risk Assessment in Rice Paddies Theory and Practice\nLecture 11: Introduction to climate change and its interaction with water-related disasters\nLecture 12: Literature review (1/2) ? global flood risk\nLecture 13: Literature review (2/2) ? flood exposure and flood damage\nLecture 14: Large-scale flood modeling (1/2) ?
