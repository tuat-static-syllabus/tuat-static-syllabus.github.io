Through this course, students conduct experiments related to master's thesis, achieve research results in each special field, and acquire research promotion ability based on biological control science and plant protection science. Actively analyze and discuss the results, deliberate representation methods, study the research results and evaluate its relevance, actively increase research capabilities. This course will be conducted under the guidance of the main supervisor.","expected_learning":"Students are required to understand scientific logic on biological control science and plant protection science and have fundamental knowledge and application which is essential for exploring the subjects. With respect to the research ethics, students will compile and publish the research results and investigation by themselves. Also, with high level of professional competence, students will have wide view insightful perspective on social issues related to plant protection.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"・Introduction\nMaster's thesis Consult with the main supervisor on how to proceed with the master's thesis, confirm the research concept and learn the importance of the research plan. Also check the points for carrying out experiments safely.\n・Treatment of experimental organisms (microorganisms, plants, and/or insects)\n・Construction and implementation of experiments, and data collection and analysis\nStudy on each research theme under the guidance of the main supervisor. Confirmation of research concepts and research plans with faculty members, information sharing and receiving advice. Through discussions with the main supervisor, students will learn how to proceed autonomously.\n・Summary and discussion of the results\nAnalyze and interpret the results obtained from each experiment referring to the previous researches, and discuss to develop into new research. Discuss methods of presenting the novelty of the research to others and the applicability of research through preparing work for papers and presentations.\n・Final presentation\nPerform final examination by presentation and question and answer.","prerequisites":"Related to subjects of the thesis, it is a required compulsory subject which is divided into special research A group. Subjects of special study group A open for April enrollment students, enrollees for October should take subjects of special study group B. Since the main subject of this course is analysis of the experimental data, the contents of one course will be more than two 90-minute lectures. Includes contents of more than 15 weeks of regular lessons.","texts_and_materials":"Occasionally prepare the latest research papers in the special field.","assessment":"Attitude to work on experiments (5%), experience degree of proficiency (5%), specificity and performance ability of experiments (45%), presentation and final examination (45%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Research project, objective, method, analysis, discussion","office_hours":"Weekdays 9: 00 ~ 18: 00, questions and discussions will be accepted as required.
