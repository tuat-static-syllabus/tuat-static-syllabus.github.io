Lectures will be irregularly given as Ins from October to January. Detailed dates and lecturers will be announced in Classroom until the end of September.\n\nArtificial nitrogen (N) fixation technology developed in earth 20th century has enabled human to create ammonia (NH3) from molecular N (N2) in the atmosphere. The fixed N is used for mainly chemical fertilizer production which has steadily increased the human food production. Whereas, human N use efficiency is very low, ca. 80% in the world, and induces a vast amount of N loss to the environment. Although N2 is inert and harmless, other forms of N, collectively called as reactive N, e.g., NH3, nitrogen oxides (NOX), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitrate (NO3-) released to the environment causes a variety of impacts such as global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, air pollution, water pollution, acidification, and eutrophication harmful to both human and ecosystem health. Thus, human N uses is a tradeoff between the benefit as fertilizers and materials and the threats to human and ecosystem health, that is called ‘N issue’. Right knowledge on human sector N flows, flows of N loss to the environment, and N dynamics in the environment and their impacts is indispensable for addressing the entangled N issue. In this course, the current knowledge on N and environmental science is exposited. Furthermore, the hot activities in Japan and the world to cope with the N issue are also explained.","expected_learning":"By the end of this class, students will be able to: (1) understand the outline of N dynamics in the environmental media such as air, soil, water, and ecosystem, (2) understand the comprehensive picture of N flows with human activity and its impacts on the environment, and (3) gain knowledge in the most recent international activities to address the N issue.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"This class is the omnibus style lecture conducted mainly in online by six lecturers.\n\nThe lecturers and the contents of the planned lecture are as follows.
