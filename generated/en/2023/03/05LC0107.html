The glycan affects property and function of protein and plays the important role in recognition of cell-cell or cell-molecule interaction. The glycosylation is a posttranslational modification and is successive reaction to which monosaccharide is added by each specific glycosyltransferases. Thus, the glycosylation is susceptible to various factors from environment, aging and etc. In this lecture, I will review from the basics of glycosylation to the diseases by abnormal glycosylation.\n\n“Physiology of the Autonomic Nervous System” (UCHIDA, Sae)\n　　We get goosebumps on skin when it is cold or sweat when it is hot. When we exercise, our heart beats faster. These are all caused by the activities of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and are important in maintaining body temperature and circulation. Although the ANS involuntary controls visceral function, but it is affected by emotions as hands sweating when we are nervous. The ANS in the brain regulates cerebral circulation related to memory and cognitive functions. This lecture overviews the function of the ANS, including the history of research and the latest findings.\n","expected_learning":"“Glycosylation and Disease” (MANYA, Hiroshi)\n1) Understand the basics of glycobiology\n2) Learn the importance of biological function of glycosylation\n\n“Physiology of the Autonomic Nervous System” (UCHIDA, Sae)\n1) Understand the basics of the autonomic nervous system\n2) Learn the importance of autonomic nervous system for homeostasis.\n","course_schedule":"“Glycosylation and Disease” (MANYA, Hiroshi)\n1) Basic of glycobiology\n2) Biosynthesis of glycan\n3) Function of glycan\n4) Abnormal glycosylation and Disease\nI will illustrate the basic of glycobiology, the approach to glycobiology and the relation between abnormal glycosylation and disease with introduction of my study on glycosylation and aging.\n\n“Physiology of the Autonomic Nervous System” (UCHIDA, Sae)\n1) What is the autonomic nervous system?\n2) Homeostasis and the autonomic nervous system\n3) Stress and the autonomic nervous system\n4) Function of the autonomic nervous system in the brain\nI will illustrate the basic of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), its inevitable role in homeostasis as well as in stress and emotion.
