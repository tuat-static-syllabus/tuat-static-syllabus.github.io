Data science is the systematization of the methodology to extract valuable information from such huge data, and the related fields include mathematical statistics, information science, machine learning, information visualization and so on. In this lecture, you can learn the basic methodology of data science by looking through data preprocessing, the theory of machine learning (unsupervised learning, supervised learning). In addition, to focus on the ever-evolving data science technology, we also introduce the latest trends in machine learning technology.","expected_learning":"- Understand the basics of data science.\n- Understand basic machine learning methods (unsupervised learning and supervised learning).\n\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.
