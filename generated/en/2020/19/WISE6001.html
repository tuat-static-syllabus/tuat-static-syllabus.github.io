This project-based practical education is realized through a collaborative platform of industry, government, and academia. The companies participating in the consortium are: ① Kubota Corporation, ② Aeon Agri Create Co., Ltd., ③ Shimadzu Corporation, ④ Japan Automobile Research Institute, ⑤ Japan Agricultural Corporation Association, ⑥ TAMA (Technology Advanced Metropolitan Area) Industrial Vitalization Association, ⑦ Leave a Nest Co., Ltd., ⑧ Recruit Career Co., Ltd., and ⑨ Jissen Women's Educational Institute. As examples, possible themes include: sharing services for AI autonomous agricultural machinery, development of all-weather measurement drone systems, agricultural work support robots with small ultrasonic motors, zero-emission of wastes, development of new plastic substitute materials for forests, environmental co-existence systems for forests and wild animals, development of next-generation breeding enabling early growth of trees, and higher energy efficiency of woody biomass. This course includes entrepreneurial activities through students' own business proposals. In this kind of activities, students obtain feedback from the target customers of the business, clarify market needs, and acquire practical skills to solve real-world problems.\n","expected_learning":"Ability to launch practical projects making use of the student's own specialized knowledge, and propose problem-solving techniques, approaches for creation of new industries, and specific cases of management.","course_schedule":"Using basic skills mastered in the Seminar for Creation of New Industries, students themselves propose, as a practical project, a \"sprout for creation of a new industry or joint research\" to a person with practical experience at a partner organization or company.
