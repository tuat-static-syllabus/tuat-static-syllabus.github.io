In a setting of agriculture-engineering collaboration, students acquire basic skills needed by high-level human resources with doctoral degrees such as the ability to pursue research themes in cooperation with partner organizations and companies. One typical theme is the creation of new industries that revolutionize agriculture and distribution through the application of cutting-edge engineering technology. Lectures present basic case studies of exploiting cutting-edge engineering technology such as information, robots, measurement, mobility, and energy, while ensuring harmony with nature (water, air, soil, weather). Students learn not only about agriculture and engineering, but also about interdisciplinary case studies involving economics, ethics, and policy. Although the specialized terminology covers a wide range, it is hoped that students will master all aspects of the material through preparation and review.","expected_learning":"Ability to understand and explain specialized terminology needed in a setting of agriculture-engineering collaboration.
