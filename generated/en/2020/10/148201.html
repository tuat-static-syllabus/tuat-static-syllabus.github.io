Overview of the syllabus and general aims of the course.\n\n2:Communication methods\n\n3:Introduction to language ? how we use language each day in our lives and what we understand by the term ‘communication’, both as everyday people and as scientists.\n\n4:Scientific journals and the daily News as examples of communication media types. How do they impact people’s understanding of ‘Science’? What value does each have now and in the future?\n\n5:Structures, or contexts, as necessary elements for learning and living: examples ? language (English and Japanese), communication media, our own personal lives and cultural history.\n\n6:‘Scientific Stereotypes’: cliche vs originality. What is a scientist supposed to be? Is she supposed to be like previous scientists, or can she be different? (Jokes may be used to illustrate certain stereotypes).\n\n7:Reporting, or ‘Writing’. The students will observe a simple performance in the classroom and write a short description of what they have observed. Here we will gain insight into interpersonal variations in organizational and expression styles.\n\n8:How do we deal with the paradox of scientific communication: i.e., that our work must be original, but written within a traditional, stereotypical framework. ‘Thinking outside of the box, paradigm-shift, game-changer etc.” ? such phrases that are in common use today.\n\n9:The role of physiological and psychological conditions on communication (both everyday and scientific). In particular we will explore the value and role of frustration, arousal and performance in relation to creativity and productiveness.\n\n10:Introduction to presentations, or ‘public speaking’, as a key scientific communication medium. This oldest form of mass communication will be discussed and we will have class exercises to teach us how to prepare ourselves to give an effective presentation.\n\n11:Introduction to Group- or Team-work. Developing the communication tradition without breaking with it completely. Continuity in relationships ? interpersonal, with our present culture and past cultures, with our education structure. Concepts of originality and authenticity.\n\n12:Esthetics and unity as essences of experience and communication\n\n13:Standard structures of scientific papers: reviews vs original articles. Class exercise on a simple research paper.\nreviews vs original articles. Class exercise on a simple research paper.\n\n14:How the scientific publication system works.
