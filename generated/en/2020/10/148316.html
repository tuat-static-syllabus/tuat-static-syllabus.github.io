In that, he creates and uses various rhythms.Temporal biology is a comprehensive discipline related to the temporal aspect of life, but has evolved as a study of biological rhythm based on the biological clock, which is a time unit unique to living organisms. This year, we will introduce the current state of interdisciplinary analysis of biological rhythms, especially circadian rhythms, using various approaches such as mathematics, physics, molecular genetics, pharmacology, physiology, and cultural history.","expected_learning":"The goal is to understand the above outline and to gain a certain understanding and awareness of issues about time in life","course_schedule":"This year, the following schedule will be held in response to coronavirus. 1-2nd Toshiyuki OkanoThe 3rd Yu Tahara(5/16, 3-5, TWIns 3F Seminar Room 3)Introduction: What is chronobiology?\nWhat is chronobiology, analysis of clock input system, transcription / translation feedback model,Physiological mechanisms of circadian rhythms such as photoperiodism, clock evolution / comparative biology (Okano), time nutrition physiology (Tahara) 4-5th Hideo Iwasaki (5/23, 3-4, TWIns 3F Seminar Room 3)Rethinking the skeleton of chronobiology: rebuttal of the transcription / translation feedback model, in vitro reconstruction of the biological clock, chronology\n6-7th Atsuko TakamatsuThe 8th Shigenobu Shibata(6/6, 3-5 Limited; Nishi-Waseda Building 63 3F PCE Room)Analysis of 3,4 period data (Takamatsu), 5 period time medicine, Pharmacology and time nutrition (Shibata) 9-11th Naoki Nomura, Professor Emeritus, Nagoya City University (Host: Talk with Hideo Iwasaki)(7/18, 3-5, TWIns 3F Seminar Room 3)Cultural magazine of the metaphor of life and clock (Iwasaki), E-series chronology, cultural anthropology, philosophy (Nomura)\n12-14th Wataru Nakamura, Professor, Nagasaki University(7/25, 3-5, TWIns3F Seminar Room 3)Relationship between aging and circadian clocks, neural circuits related to clocks (Note that each day, after the lecture, you will be asked to prepare and submit a report on the spot.
