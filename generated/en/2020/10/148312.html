Metabolic activity of individual microorganisms are minute, but they contribute strongly to elements cycle in biosphere due to their huge biomass. This course provides knowledge how microorganisms live in natural environments, and how various microbial metabolic activities involve in the existence of human beings. And, we can utilise various microbial metabolic activities for clean-up of polluted environments and resource problems. This course aims to provide a basic knowledge for application of microorganisms to solve environmental problems.","expected_learning":"Students are expected to,\n\n1. improve the knowledge about microorganisms.\n2. understand the roles of microorganisms in formation of biosphere.\n3. understand basic knowledge of techniques for environmental monitoring, bioremediation, environmental protection by using microorganisms.","course_schedule":"Specific coverage will include:\n\n1. What is the Environmental Microbiology?\n2. Physical and chemical environment of microbial world\n3. Growth of microorganisms\n4. Measurement of microorganisms\n5. Kinetics of microbial growth and substrate consumption\n6. Structure and function of microbial food web\n7. Grazing resistant of bacteria\n8. Diversity of microorganisms\n9. Bioremediation","prerequisites":"- It is desirable to download handouts and summaries from the moodle (portal site) and to complete an assignment prior to every class. Completion of assignments are not compulsory, but understanding the class is much harder if not.\n- Handing assignments, questionnaire in at the end of every class is required.\n- Taking Microbiology is desirable.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts and summaries can be downloaded from the moodle.","assessment":"Assignment: 20 %\nQuestionnaire: 20 %\nTerm-end examination: 60 %","message_from_instructor":"Questioning mind is indispensable.
