While reviewing high school-level chemistry, classes will introduce the key principles in chemistry, which involves atomic orbitals, valence bond theory, molecular orbital theory, molecular representations, acids and bases, stereochemistry. A particular emphasis is placed on learning the structures of organic compounds, so that it will serve as an introductory course for Bioorganic Chemistry courses.","expected_learning":"Learn the basics of bioorganic chemistry for proteins, nucleic acids, and coenzymes. Students will also gain the ability to understand cutting-edge research on bioorganic chemistry and communicate it to researchers in other specialized fields in an easy-to-understand manner.","course_schedule":"Based on the latest scientific literature, we conduct a literature search on research themes that are different from those of the master's course. In addition, summarize the contents of the survey in a report and give an oral presentation.\nDiscuss from a scientific point of view based on the presentation.","prerequisites":"Organic chemistry undergraduate level","texts_and_materials":"Bioorganic Chemistry, by Dugas (Springer)","assessment":"Presentation and disucussion 80%\nQuiz in every term 20%","message_from_instructor":"Discover new discoveries in life sciences by learning biochemistry from organic chemistry","course_keywords":"protein, nucleic acid, enzyme, drug discovery, organic synthesis","office_hours":"Monday, 12-14 pm","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/22/2020 11:49:44 AM","name":{"id":1165,"ja":"生物有機化学特論","en":"Bio-organic Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":2064,"ja":"櫻井 香里, 寺 正行","en":"SAKURAI Kaori, TERA Masayuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"工学府博士前期","category":"前期課程科目","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"火1","references":"Medicinal Chemistry (by Kita, Hiraoka, Tokyo Kagaku-Dojin)"}}
