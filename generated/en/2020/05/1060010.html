Formal pragmatic analysis takes a view of language “meaning” broader than sentential content, aiming to also capture meaning only conveyed when sentences are used in utterances. In this course, participants learn about the scope, basic concepts, and methods of formal pragmatics and subsequently apply these to the analysis of concrete phenomena in Japanese such as indirect speech acts, sentence-final expressions, or intonation.","expected_learning":"Participants will be able to identify linguistic phenomena in the scope of pragmatics and comprehend its basic concepts. They will be able to independently analyze concrete phenomena by formal pragmatic methods. Achieving these goals will enable participants to observe language from a new perspective, which can lead to more efficient and effective language use.","course_schedule":"1.

Academic progress deemed equivalent to the standard study time set by our university is required for credit. The ability of participants to capture language as a phenomenon from a pragmatic perspective, and to apply the formal pragmatic methods acquired in the course to the analysis of concrete linguistic phenomena will be assessed. The evaluation is weighted as follows: online presentation or summary: 30%, regular assignments: 30%, term paper: 40%.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Appointments can be requested by email.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/24/2020 11:15:49 AM","name":{"id":1157,"ja":"科学特論Ⅳ","en":"Science: Special Lecture Ⅳ"},"instructor":{"id":1913,"ja":"RIESER LUKAS","en":"RIESER Lukas"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"common courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"Building 12 Room 422","day_period":"Tue.5","references":"Betty J.
