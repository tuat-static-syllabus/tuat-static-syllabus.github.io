Since the properties on molecule is dramatically changed by the three dimentional structure, the stereoselective synthesis of organic acrchitecture is major topic in synthetic organic chemistry.\nIn this lecture, I want to explain the details about stereocontrolled synthesis of various important class of organic molecules, and the way of thinking of the reaction mechanism using curved arrow.","expected_learning":"Understanding the stereoselective reaction, which is indispensable knowledge in modern synthetic organic synthesis\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1st Lecture: introduction\n2nd Lecture: Fundamental information on asymmetric synthesis\n3rd Lecture: DIels-Alder reaction 1\n4th Lecture: DIels-Alder reaction 2\n5th Lecture: Aldol reaction 1\n6th Lecture: Aldol reaction 2\n7th Lecture: Summarization of the previous classes (from 1st to 6th), Midterm exam\n8th Lecture: Stereoselective synthesis of olefins 1\n9th Lecture: Stereoselective synthesis of olefins 1\n10th Lecture: Pericyclic reaction 1\n11th Lecture: Pericyclic reaction 2\n12th Lecture: Asymmetric synthesis involving kinetic resolution 1\n13th Lecture: Asymmetric synthesis involving kinetic resolution 2\n14th Lecture: Method for controlling of various special asymmetric information\n15th Lecture: Summarization of the previous classes (from 1th to 14th), Term-end examination","prerequisites":"Although teacher consider about students who are not familiar with organic chemistry, the fundamental knowledge, which are taught in bachelor degree, are indispensable to understand the contents.","texts_and_materials":"nothing","assessment":"The grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, report, and online tests.
