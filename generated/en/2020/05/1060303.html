Based on the \"measurement uncertainty\" (Maruzen) summarized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, we learn the means to quantitatively evaluate these errors.\n(2) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)\nLearn the fundamental equation, the solution of the linear equation differential equation, the foundation of the difference method, and the actual of the compressive flow CFD with the numerical analysis of compressive flow (wave).","expected_learning":"The two points are expected to\n(1) Did you handle the means to estimate \"measurement uncertainty\"?\n(2) Do you understand the numerical method of partial differential equations by \"finite difference method\", especially the stability, coordinate transformation, discretization, and typical numerical schemes?","course_schedule":"Week 1 Orientation\n\nWeek 2 1-1 Uncertainty of measurement and uncertainty, basic performance of measuring equipment (resolution, sensitivity, measurement range, accuracy, precision)\nWeek 3 1-2 Uncertainty analysis (1) Evaluation of variation of single measured quantity based on statistical theory, propagation of error\nWeek 4 1-2 Uncertainty analysis (2) Analysis method based on the American Institute of Mechanical Engineer's Contract \"Measurement Uncertainty'\nWeek 5 1-2 Uncertainty Analysis (3) Analysis method based on the American Institute of Mechanical Engineer's Contract \"Measurement Uncertainty\"\nWeek 6 1-2 Uncertainty analysis (4) Analysis method based on the American Institute of Mechanical Engineering Contract \"Measurement Uncertainty\"\n\nUncertainty of measured physical quantity is indispensable for planning, implementation and evaluation of experiment. By knowing the uncertainty of data correctly, for the first time, it can be used effectively for engineering applications (comparison with theoretical formula, derivation of empirical formula, etc.).\n\nWeek 7 2-1 Basic Equations of Fluid Dynamics: Control volume, force acting on fluid, mass, momentum and energy conservation law, equation of state\nWeek 8 2-2 Linear Wave: Wave Equation (Sonic), D'Alembert's Solution, Wave Damping and Dispersion\nWeek 9 3-1 Basics of Finite Difference Approximation: Difference Approximation, Central Difference and One Side Difference, Explicit and Implicit Method, Stability of Differential Approximation\nWeek 10 3-2 Finite Difference Method for Linear Partial Differential Equation: Diffusion Equation, Advection Equation\nWeek 11 4-1 Euler Equations: Nature and characteristic curve of one-dimensional Euler equation\nWeek 12 4-2 Numerical method for Euler equations: Numerical flux, Flux Difference Splitting method, higher order precision of spatial difference term\n\nComputational fluid dynamics (Computational Fluid Dyanmics) is the third research approach following theoretical fluid dynamics, experimental hydrodynamics. It has developed rapidly in the last 30 years, and the foundation has been settled almost to the present.
