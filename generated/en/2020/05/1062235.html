The purpose is to expand the field of view by conducting experiments in a laboratory different from the laboratory to which the affiliation belongs, and touching on the ideas and methods of research in different fields. Applied Chemistry Seminar I, which conducts literature research and presentations on research subjects in different fields, is a subject with a complementary role.\n\n[Summary] Expand the field of view by conducting a set experiment in a laboratory different from your laboratory, touching on the ideas and methods of research in different fields and putting it together in a report.\n","expected_learning":"The goal is to expand the field of view of research by touching on research ideas and experimental methods in fields different from your own specialty.\n\nDiploma policy perspective of this course: See curriculum map of course guidance.\n\n","course_schedule":"At the beginning of the first semester, experimental research proposals (instrumental analysis, synthesis experiment, evaluation experiment, etc.) proposed by each laboratory will be presented. Each experimental task is decided after adjusting the number of people based on the desired survey. Each assignment will be conducted at the appropriate time of the year according to the instructions of the faculty in charge. After completion, submit a report to the laboratory.","prerequisites":"It is classified as a common subject and is a required subject.\nSelf-study equivalent to at least the university's standard hours is required for taking the course, and follow the instructions of the teacher in charge.\n","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Comprehensive evaluation based on experimental attitude and reports. No points will be added based on attendance alone.","message_from_instructor":"This is a valuable opportunity to conduct experiments outside of your own laboratory.
