Since the structure, reactions, and functionalities of the molecules are governed by the behaviors of the electrons, it is of fundamental importance to design organic materials with your eyes set on the electronic structures. Following the relevant undergraduate courses, this course discusses methodologies for examining the electronic structures and properties of organic molecules.","expected_learning":"To understand the concept of organic chemistry, such as steric hindrance and steric repulsion, from the theory of molecules, so that you can organize your own.","course_schedule":"This lecture has three parts.\nThe first part (2nd to 5th): Reading the book “Molecular Crystals / John, written by D. Wright” and follows the presentation material.\nPart 2 (6th to 9th): Lectures on molecular theory\nPart 3 (10th to 15th: Presentation of learning\nSpecifically, it proceeds according to the following schedule, but depending on the situation, there may be replacement of each part.\n1st: Guidance\n2nd: Learning about molecular crystals 1\n3rd: Learning about molecular crystals 2\n4th: Learning about molecular crystals 3\n5th: Learning about molecular crystals 4\n6th: Lecture “What is Organic Chemistry?”\n・ Myth of modern chemistry\n・ Various substances\n・ Ability to create substances\n・ Akebono of stereochemistry\n・ Three-dimensional chemistry\n7th Lecture “What is Intermolecular Force?”\n・ Forces acting between molecules\n・ Classification of hydrogen bond\n・ Weak hydrogen bond\n・ Characteristics of intermolecular force\n8th Lecture “Interaction between molecules”\n・ Separate molecules\n・ Investigate molecular properties\n・ Identifying molecules\n・ Creating molecules\n9th Lecture \"How intermolecular forces work\"\n・ Molecular shape\n・ Molecular optical rotation\n・ Polymer interactions\n10th learning presentation 1\n11th learning presentation 2\n12th Learning Presentation 3\n13th learning presentation 4\n14th learning announcement (preliminary day)\n15th document submission date","prerequisites":"Ability to earn the credits of quantum chemistry I･II and structural chemistry offered for the undergraduate students of organic and polymer materials chemistry (or similar courses) is necessary.","texts_and_materials":"J.
