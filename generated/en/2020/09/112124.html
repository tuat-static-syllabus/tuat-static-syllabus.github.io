Sensors are the indispensable components in such automatization of mechanical systems. Students will learn various sensors in this course. The topics covered in this course are optical sensors and mobile robot olfaction. Basic of quantum electronics that are necessary to understand working principles of optical sensors are also dealt in this course. Other types of sensors will be covered in Advanced Environmental Mechanical Systems III.\n\nThe topics covered in the course include:\n- Energy band theory\n- Optical sensors\n- Mobile robot olfaction\n\nThis course is included in the Specialized Applied Courses of the curriculum of the Department of Bio-Functions and Systems Science.","expected_learning":"Students who successfully completed this course will be able to explain the working principles of popular sensors and to select appropriate sensors for their own experiments.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Energy band of intrinsic, p-type, and n-type semiconductors\nWeek 2: P-n junction diodes\nWeek 3: MOS transistors\nWeek 4: Photomultiplier tubes, photoconductors, photodiodes, phototransistors, and position sensitive devices\nWeek 5: CCDs, CMOS image sensors\nWeek 6: Infrared sensors, infrared imagers\nWeek 7: Mobile robot olfaction\nWeek 8: Recent topics in sensor technologies","prerequisites":"Basic knowledge on electronics.
