In this lecture, students study on how we describe phenomena in a mathematical forms. By solving excersices in each class, you can understand basics in modeling. We study some practical topics, such as momentum flux and catalyst reaction with mass transfer. We study some practical problems related to momentum and surface reaction on catalyst with mass transfer, and so on.","expected_learning":"Understanding a basics of mathematical modeling\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps for BASE.","course_schedule":"The contents below would be changed depending upon your understanding.\nThe following is an example in 2019.\n\n1st Thermal conduction in solid, diffusion of materials, boundary conditions\n2nd Diffusion equation in spherical coordinate, boundary conditions\n3rd Dimensionless form of differential equations, estimation of required time using characteristic time constants\n4th Flow in a circular tube and momentum balance\n5th Adsorption/desorption, mass transfer and reaction: combined case.\n6th Reaction and reaction enthalpy, sever heat-up of a reactor\n7th incoming and outcoming of mass, energy and momentum\n8th Summary and revise\nFinal exam.\n・Mass transfer, adsorption and surface reaction on catalyst (ii)\n・Formation of fouling layer and thermal resistance\n・Rate-limiting step and approximate solution(i): catalyst reaction\n・Rate-limiting step and approximate solution (ii): heat transfer via tube\n・Dimensionless form of differential equations: time constants and their physical meaning\n・Summary\nFinal Exam\n\nSolution of a model and understanding using the solution\nChemical reactions and heat balance\nfundamental equations for heat exchangers\nNumerical solution for unsteady state problems","prerequisites":"Students should understand fundamental methods to solve differential equations.\n\nIn addition to 15 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Excersises in every week (30%) and the final examination (70%).Total score is 100 and students with a score more than 60 are certified.
