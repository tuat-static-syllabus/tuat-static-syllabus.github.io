Furthermore, we will extract the problems and issues that can be expected in realizing the goals, and devise measures to solve them, and then refine the project plan. Being able to make such a plan is important for being active as an independent researcher, and the purpose of this course is to experience the virtual process at an early stage.\n\n[Summary] As a special subject, the research project is planned and the surrounding area is investigated, and the results estimated from the methods such as experiments and other known parts that may be required are derived and comprehensive judgment is made. We will discuss the possibility of realization. For this reason, faculty members other than the original supervisor will be the chief examiner, and after consulting with the students, one task different from their own research theme will be set. We will conduct multifaceted studies on this issue and develop research projects. An oral presentation on the proposal will be made, and after discussion, it will be finalized as a report.\n","expected_learning":"Plan research projects in fields different from your own research theme, develop proposals to a level where they can be judged as feasible, present them, discuss them, and compile them as reports.\n\nDiploma policy perspective of this course: See curriculum map of course guidance.\n","course_schedule":"Students who take this course first decide on a faculty member to be the chief examiner and register for the course under the name of the chief examiner. As a general rule, consult with the chief examiner and set a research topic different from the student's own research theme. In order to plan a research project based on the set issues, we will first conduct a thorough literature survey on existing research and technology development examples, and establish a basic concept of the research project. While guiding the results estimated from methods such as experiments and known parts that will be necessary, we will extract possible problems and issues and devise measures to solve them, so that we can Study and create a research project draft. Once the proposal has been finalized, an oral presentation will be given and discussed with the participation of two principal examiners and deputy examiners. Based on the results, we will further develop the proposal and finally compile it as a report.","prerequisites":"This subject is divided into common subjects and is a required subject.\nSelf-study equivalent to at least the university's standard hours is required for taking the course, and follow the instructions of the supervisor.\n","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Comprehensive evaluation based on the contents of presentations and reports. Also, there will be no additional points due to attendance.","message_from_instructor":"In the future, I think that taking this course will be useful when you are asked about your research planning ability as a researcher. It is also an opportunity to receive comments and advice from different perspectives from teachers in different fields.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"10/10/2020 4:19:17 PM","name":{"id":1376,"ja":"特別計画研究","en":"Applied Chemistry: Special Research Planning"},"instructor":{"id":590,"ja":"平野 雅文","en":"HIRANO Masafumi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"工学府博士後期","category":"共通科目","department":"","semester":"通年","course_type":"通年","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":""}}
