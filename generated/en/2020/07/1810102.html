Students will learn the basic methods and principles in finding scientific evidence. In particular, lectures will deal with the basic theories in social mathematics (statistics, economics, etc.), experimental design and analysis, systems engineering, artificial intelligence, etc., as well as with analysis methods that have wide-ranging applications in the real world, such as big data analysis, GIS, and cost-benefit analysis. Also, in order to deepen understanding of content regarding scientific literacy and analysis methods learned in the lectures, case study workshops will be held along with the lectures.\n　The 2nd part (academic writing workshops) is aimed at mastering practical techniques in writing English papers. In particular, as introduction to a proposal, students will individually write an abstract on an assigned theme, and in the process, check, evaluate, and improve the written contents as necessary, and submit a final draft, after gaining an understanding of the essential points in academic English writing (including important pointers and rules) as well as of the characteristics of humanities/social sciences and natural sciences.\n　Lectures will be given in English, while practicum sessions, seminars, and workshops will be held both in English and Japanese depending on the students’ skill levels. The combined use of English and Japanese will be done in such a way as to avoid any disadvantage to students who do not understand Japanese.\n\n","expected_learning":"The learning outcomes for this course include the following:\n1. gain analytical abilities useful in articulating logical and pluralistic ways of thinking called for in international settings.\n2. demonstrate basic theories, practical skills and effective English writing techniques for formulating and implementing international development strategies and plans.\n","course_schedule":"(1) 10/10 Foundations of Sustainability Research B (1)\n・09:00 - 12:00 Nakayama Chikako (TUFS): Science, Technology and Society\n・13:00- 16:00 Misawa Kazuhiko and Ito Terumasa (TUAT): Academic Research Writing\n(2) 10/24 Foundations of Sustainability Research B (2)\n・09:00 - 12:00 Misawa Kazuhiko (TUAT): Essence of Scientific Thinking Concepts and Tools\n・13:00- 16:00 Katori Hiroko (TUAT), Yokoi Hiroshi and OKADA-SHUDO Yoshiko (UEC)\nSustainability from the Viewpoint of Natural Scientists\n(3) 11/7 Foundations of Sustainability Research B (3)\n・09:00 - 12:00 Takeuchi Shinichi (TUFS):Technique of Fieldwork\n・13:00- 16:00 Sato Jin (University of Tokyo): Sustainability and resources\n(4) 11/14 Foundations of Sustainability Research B (4)\n・09:00 - 12:00 Hashiyama Tomonori (UEC): Basics of AI\n・13:00- 16:00 Yamamoto Kayoko (UEC): Analysis of Big Data/ Basics and Use Range of GIS\n(5) 11/28 Foundations of Sustainability Research B (5)\n・09:00 - 12:00 Chitose Atsushi: Basic Statistics & Economic Thinking\n・13:00 - 16:00 Yamauchi Kazushi (Tokyo Medical and Dental University): Sustainability in\nPublic Health\n(6) 12/ 5 Foundations of Sustainability Research B (6)\n・09:00 - 12:00 Review Meeting of Students’ Summaries (1)\n・13:00- 16:00 Review Meeting of Students’ Summaries (2)\n","prerequisites":"You are recommended to prepare for, and review, the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University for each class.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Paper 60%\nParticipation and presentation 40%\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"sustainability research, proposal writing","office_hours":"Saturdays: 9:00-16:00, or email: department@go.wt-jdpsr.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"10/12/2020 1:14:05 PM","name":{"id":2272,"ja":"サステイナビリティ研究基礎B","en":"Foundations of Sustainability Research B"},"instructor":{"id":2098,"ja":"野村 義宏, 伊藤 輝将","en":"NOMURA Yoshihiro, ITO Terumasa"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"工学府博士後期","category":"後期課程科目","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"工学府","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":"To be distributed and introduced in each class."}}
