Synthetic chemistry, reactions, and related compounds related to aromatic high-performance polymer materials learned in Organic Chemistry-related subjects offered in the undergraduate course of Department of Organic and Polymer Materials Chemistry and Organic Materials Analysis Advanced Course I offered in graduate course of Organic and Polymer Materials Chemistry Based on the concept of the spatial structure-reactivity relationship of scientists, the chemistry of aromatic high-performance organic materials will be comprehensively verified based on the molecular spatial structure as an insulator.\nb. An integrated, bird's-eye view of the chemical behavior and physical properties of organic materials, which are the main constituents of organic materials, using an understanding of the molecular spatial structure, and the contents of related reports in journals Aims to acquire the level of ability to deeply read and understand, and make proposals for development.\n","expected_learning":"Of organic reactions and physical properties in the field of organic material chemistry.\n・ Understanding the principles and limitations of molecular space structure analysis methods\n・ Evaluation of analysis results of molecular spatial structure and interpretation from the viewpoint of molecular orbital method ((Perspective of the organic reaction operator)\n・ Understanding the correlation between molecular spatial structure and organic reactivity (perspective of the person who conducted organic reactions)\n・ Understanding of the relationship between molecular spatial structure and basic physical properties (position to synthesize organic molecules constituting organic materials)\nAdvanced comprehensive professional ability acquisition.
