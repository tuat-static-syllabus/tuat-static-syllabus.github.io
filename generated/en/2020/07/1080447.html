These contents can be seen\n\nanywhere at any time.\nThe students can access from the inside and outside of the\n\nUniversity. You need to take the ID and Password to be able to\n\naccess to this e-learning class.\n\nAccess moodle from the folowing site:\n\n(http://moodle.elp.tuat.ac.jp/moodle/login/index.php) in a\n\nuniversity homepage.","expected_learning":"In this e-learning course, you will be able to learn about both energy including Renewable Energy and Environment. As conventional energies emit CO2 into our earth environment, it is necessary to analyze such energies, and also provide some countermeasures, such as introducing Micro and Smart grids as Next-Generation Power Systems. You can be familiar with such issues in this course.\nIt should be noted that the contents of this course is similar with Advanced Environmental Energy Engineering 1, however here you will required to do investigation research and submit 6 report. Therefore your study will be enriched with advanced investigation, analysis and evaluation of many issues in this area.","course_schedule":"Note: The contents of this course are similar to the \"Advanced Environmental Energy Engineering Ⅰ\", however the contents of reports are more advanced. I may ask you to make programming for some calculation.\n\n1st Class contents: Guidance & Course Contents Explanation (on moodle)\n2nd Class contents: Fundamental and Present Energy Systems in Japan\n3rd Class Contents: Energy Resources and Energy Situation\n4th class contents: Energy consumption and its impact on the global environment\n5th Class Contents: Energy consumption and its impact on the global environment (Acid Rain)\n6th Class Contents: Energy consumption and its impact on the global environment (Desertification)\n7th Class Contents: Energy Demand Forecasting (Short-term)\n8th Class Contents: Energy Demand Forecasting (using ANN for short term demand forecasting)\n9th Class Contents: Energy Demand Forecasting (Real Example of Short-term Demand Forecasting)\n10th Class Contents: Energy Demand Forecasting (Mid-term & Long-term)\n11th Class Contents: Renewable Energies\n12th Class Contents: Total Renewable Energies (Application of Hybrid System)\n13th Class Contents: Power Deregulation in many countries including Japan\n14th Class Contents: Continuation of power deregulation\n15th Class Contents: The future of Environmental Energy Engineering\n\n","prerequisites":"This course is only for PhD(Doctor course) students.
