The seminars are centered on group reading and discussion of basic literature under the supervision of three research supervisors to enhance their competencies and refine their research plans. In the process, students will clarify how their research contributes academically to related fields of study. Students are also expected to acquire a diverse academic perspective, which is essential in sustainability research, and understand the usefulness of learning and conceptualization methods used in other disciplines. In order to instill an interdisciplinary perspective centered on their doctoral dissertation theme, students will hold discussions from various perspectives with students of Interdisciplinary Seminar I to IV, and learn knowledge and approaches to analysis and social implementation in other fields.","expected_learning":"Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to:\n- enhance core competency in their doctoral dissertation research field.\n- explain the purpose and significance of their research in relation to current research trends.\n- refine their doctoral research by accelerating each aspect of research, namely, comprehension, analysis and implementation, through discussions with the assistant supervisors.\n- acquire consensus-building skills and the capacity to adapt to diverse value systems and environments.\n- leverage new ideas, knowledge, and information obtained through meaningful academic exchanges with researchers not only in their specialized fields but also from other disciplines, into the design of their doctoral dissertation research.","course_schedule":"　The principal supervisor will coordinate with the assistant supervisors to hold regular seminars in each of their laboratories. Remote lecture systems or other media may be used as necessary.\n　Students will hold group reading and discussion of important previous research in their specialized fields and other related fields to enhance their competency. In particular, students are expected to deepen their understanding of the various problems that arise during the conduct of their research/experiment as well as of the countermeasures to those problems while incorporating the results of discussions in the seminars into their daily laboratory work and research activities. At the same time, discussions with the principal supervisor and the two assistant supervisors will be held to help students clarify the academic contributions of their research, narrow down their research themes, and improve their doctoral dissertation research plans in consideration of opinions of faculty members in other disciplines. Students are expected to actively engage in discussions with the assistant supervisors and research laboratory members and in communicating their own experience, analytical approach, and ideas.\n　At the end of the course, students will prepare to write a report regarding their research concept for the collaborative humanities and sciences colloquium as part of the \"Advanced Practicum in Sustainability Research I\" Practicum Course.\n\n---The content of the main classes conducted by the principal supervisors are as follows---\n\nTokyo University of Foreign Studies (TUFS):\n　Shinichi Takeuchi: Reading and presentation of literature will be held to deepen students' understanding of particular regions and languages and to increase their competency in area studies. In particular, the class will help students deepen their historical understanding of the various problems that arise in particular regions. At the same time, the class will enable students to clarify the academic contribution of their research and narrow down their research theme through discussions with faculty members and research laboratory members.\n\n　Chikako Nakayama: Group reading and discussion of important previous research literature in the field of global studies will be held to deepen students' understanding of global world structures and the lineage of global theories and ideologies.\n\n　Hyoduk Lee: The class will help students enhance their competency in cultural studies (analysis and comprehension of contemporary cultural phenomena) and refine their research plans. In the process, students will be able to clarify how their research contributes academically to related fields of study.\n\nTokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT):\n　Atsushi Chitose: Group reading and discussion of previous research literature on fields related to international agricultural development, such as agricultural development theories, agricultural economics, income disparity, and poverty, will be held to help students improve the concept and plan of the doctoral dissertation research theme they submitted upon admission to the program, while accumulating basic knowledge that serves as foundation for their doctoral dissertation research.\n\n　Yoshiro Nomura: Group reading and discussion of cutting-edge research papers in biological resources functional chemistry will be held to enable students to understand social needs and research trends in the field. The class will also help students formulate concrete research plans and clarify the academic significance and usefulness of their research.\n\n　Hiroko Katori: Group reading and discussion of previous research literature in energy science will be held to help students understand the latest research trends in the field.
