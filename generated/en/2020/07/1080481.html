In order to understand the real world situation in cyber space, we need 1) to recognize and learn about real world situation by referring physical and mathematical models by which real world can be explained, 2) to construct models of real world in cyber space, and 3) to execute urban and social services based on the constructed models. While presenting the new images of urban and social services, we also address the key technologies used to implement such the services and the ways of integration of the technologies including information service implementation, sensing, physical and mathematical model, recognition and machine learning of sensory data","expected_learning":"First goal of attendee of this lecture is to acquire the sense of “information architect” who can design and show the way of complex and innovative information service implementaiton. Second goal is to deeply learn key technologies, although it is not required to understand the details of all the technologies addressed in the lecture, because wide variety of technologies are talked in the lecture.","course_schedule":"We present the image of the following urban and social services, and the ways and methods of integrating the key technologies.\n[Service]\nIntroduction to implementation of urban and social services\nUnderstanding and visualization of urban spaces\nUnderstanding human behavior and vital signals\nEfficient distribution of social common resources based on information sharing by information technology\nControl of human flow in large-scale social event and safety\n[Key Technology]\nMachin learning, stochastic reasoning\nComplex network as social model\nMathematical model of social resource distribution, percolation theory\nGame theory\nInformation architecture of sensory data processing\nSimulation of human and traffic flow","prerequisites":"Knowledge on programming, information network, physics, and mathematics at the graduate level of science or engineering faculty is required.\nYou should prepare and review the contents of this lecture in addition to the standard hours (30 hours) of lectures, using teaching materials and reference books.","texts_and_materials":"Specified in the lecture, if needed.","assessment":"Attendance ratio, and document report.","message_from_instructor":"Not just learn, try to implement innovative urban and social information services.","course_keywords":"Urban service, social service, vital information, recognition, machine learning, complex network, percolation, game theory, simulation.","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"10/16/2020 3:36:46 PM","name":{"id":2434,"ja":"電子情報工学特別講義Ⅰ","en":"Special Lecture in Electronic and Information Engineering I"},"instructor":{"id":2093,"ja":"車谷 浩一, 幸島 明男, 山下 倫央, 清水 郁子","en":"KURUMATANI Koichi, SASHIMA Akio, SHIMIZU Ikuko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Doctor)","category":"courses for doctoral programs","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
