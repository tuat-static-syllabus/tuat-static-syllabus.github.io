What does it mean that we humans live in health? In this lecture, understanding the adaptation of the mind and the brain such as daily efforts and learning as life science. Specifically, we learn from the molecular biology of the cell the relationship between the global environment that created life and the human society, the shapes, physical properties, and metabolism of biomaterials and biopolymers present in the body. In addition to lectures for basic learning, exercises include practical elements such as group discussion, presentation, practical training. We propose how to improve public health literacy toward realization of healthy life span society.\n","expected_learning":"Living in harmony with AI, as a human being living in Japan who is a super aged and declining birthrate, we take health problems as our own problems. Learn the body-mind unified science as a practical science and the life sciences behind it and practice everyday exercises to increase health literacy.
