In particular, the lectures are aimed at cultivating a sense that serves as the foundation of ethical and pluralistic ways of thinking called for in international settings. The students learn about SDGs, global issues, and intellectual properties.\nThe lectures will deal with the essence of modern globalization and the issues and frameworks surrounding the modern international community. The lecture also offers the introduction of critical concepts to deepen the understandings of current globalized world and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Also, in order to deepen understanding of content learned in the lectures and to enhance the ability to apply the knowledge learned, workshops that provide opportunities for collaborative discussions in the humanities and sciences and for interdisciplinary debates will be held along with the lectures. In particular, students with different specializations will form a team and select a particular theme by which they will discuss ideas and formulate practical measures for resolving issues and for understanding the current state of social sustainability from a broad perspective.\nLectures will be given in English, while practicum sessions, seminars, and workshops will be held both in English and Japanese depending on the students’ skill levels. The combined use of English and Japanese will be done in such a way as to avoid any disadvantage to students who do not understand Japanese.\n","expected_learning":"The learning outcomes for this course include the following:\n1. understand the expectations of the international community pertaining to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are embodied in the concept of sustainability, as well as the basic concepts of justice and ethical perspectives supporting the SDGs.\n2. understand and explain ethical and pluralistic ways of thinking called for in international settings.\n3. gain universal and practical knowledge for formulating and implementing international development strategies and plans.\n4. demonstrate the ability to perform evidence-based problem-identification and problem-solving.\n5. acquire theoretical and practical understanding of the various social problems faced by the international community.\n6. gain and demonstrate flexible, multifaceted conceptual and presentation skills that enable proposing solutions to the problems while respecting diverse cultures and value systems.\n","course_schedule":"(1) 5/2: Foundations of Sustainability Research A (1)\n・09:00-12:00 Takeuchi Shinichi (TUFS): Context and Backgrounds of SDGs\n・13:00-16:00 Chitose Atsushi (TUAT): Targets and Examples of Sustainability Research\n(2) 5/9: Foundations of Sustainability Research A(2)\n・09:00-12:00 Chitose Atsushi and Nomura Yoshihiro (TUAT): Human Development, Food,\nResources and Energy\n・13:00-16:00 Iwasaki Minoru (TUFS): Global Public Sphere and International Society\n(3) 5/23: Foundations of Sustainability Research A(3)\n・09:00-12:00 Nakayama Chikako (TUFS): World-Systems Analysis and SDGs\n・13:00-16:00 Takada Hideshige (TUAT): Marine Plastic Pollution\n(4) 6/6: Foundations of Sustainability Research A(4)\n・09:00-12:00 Eto Manabu (Hitotsubashi Univ.): Standardization and Intellectual Property Rights\n・13:00-16:00 Yamamoto Kayoko (UEC): Environmental Problems and Disaster Resilience\n(5) 6/13: Foundations of Sustainability Research A(5)\n・09:00-12:00 Group Discussion: What is Sustainability Research?\n・13:00-16:00 Ken Nagasaka: Sustainable Energy Engineering\n(6) 7/4: Foundations of Sustainability Research A(6)\n・09:00-16:00 Student Presentations (by D2 students)\n","prerequisites":"You are recommended to prepare for, and review, the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University for each class.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Term paper 60%\nParticipation and presentation 40%\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"sustainability research, sustainable development goals (SDGs)","office_hours":"Saturdays: 9:00-16:00, or email: department@go.wt-jdpsr.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"10/12/2020 2:24:02 PM","name":{"id":2271,"ja":"サステイナビリティ研究基礎A","en":"Foundations of Sustainability Research A"},"instructor":{"id":2098,"ja":"野村 義宏, 伊藤 輝将","en":"NOMURA Yoshihiro, ITO Terumasa"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Doctor)","category":"courses for doctoral programs","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"World Bank.
