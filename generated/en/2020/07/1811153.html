The seminars are centered on discussion and laboratory work under the supervision of three research supervisors. Students will finalize their research plan as well as improve their competency through seminars and laboratory work at the research laboratory of the principal supervisor. In the process, students are expected to recognize the relationship and relevance of their research theme with related fields of study. Students are also expected to acquire a diverse academic perspective, which is essential in sustainability research, and understand the usefulness of learning and conceptualization methods used in other disciplines. In order to instill an interdisciplinary perspective centered on their doctoral dissertation theme, students will hold discussions from various perspectives with students of Interdisciplinary Seminar I to IV, and learn knowledge and approaches to analysis and social implementation in other fields.","expected_learning":"Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to:\n- enhance core competency in their doctoral dissertation research field.\n- explain the purpose and significance of their research in relation to current research trends.\n- refine their doctoral research by accelerating each aspect of research, namely, comprehension, analysis and implementation, through discussions with the assistant supervisors.\n- acquire consensus-building skills and the capacity to adapt to diverse value systems and environments.\n- leverage new ideas, knowledge, and information obtained through meaningful academic exchanges with researchers not only in their specialized fields but also from other disciplines, into the design of their doctoral dissertation research.","course_schedule":"　The principal supervisor will coordinate with the assistant supervisors to hold regular seminars in each of their laboratories. Remote lecture systems or other media may be used as necessary.\n　Students will hold group reading and discussion of important previous research in their specialized fields and other related fields to enhance their competency. In particular, students are expected to acquire the capability to adapt to the various problems that arise during the conduct of their research/experiment as well as to the countermeasures to those problems, and to recognize the significance and originality of their research in relation to previous studies, while incorporating the results of discussions in the seminars into their daily laboratory work and research activities. At the same time, discussions with the principal supervisor and the two assistant supervisors will be held to train students to clearly explain the academic contributions of their research, as well as to improve their doctoral dissertation research plans in consideration of opinions of faculty members in other disciplines. Students are expected to actively engage in discussions with the assistant supervisors and research laboratory members and in communicating their own experience, analytical approach, and ideas.\n　At the end of the course, students will prepare to present their research concept and implementation plan for the collaborative humanities and sciences colloquium as part of the “Advanced Practicum in Sustainability Research II” Practicum Course.\n\n---The main contents of the classes conducted by the principal supervisors are as follows.---\n\nTokyo University of Foreign Studies (TUFS):\n　Shinichi Takeuchi: In the class, students are required to read literature and make presentations to deepen understanding of particular regions and languages and to increase their competency in area studies. In particular, the class will help students deepen their historical understanding of the various problems that arise in particular regions, which will enable them to recognize the significance and originality of their research in relation to previous studies. The class will also train them to clearly explain the academic contribution of their research through discussions with faculty members and research laboratory members.\n\n　Chikako Nakayama: The class will introduce students to analysis in particular areas related to global world structures, and enable them to finalize their research plans. In the process, students are expected to recognize the relationship and relevance of their research theme with related fields of study.\n\n　Hyoduk Lee: The class will help students enhance their competency in cultural studies (political analysis of cultural phenomena) and finalize their research plans. In the process, students are expected to recognize the relationship and relevance of their research theme with related fields of study.\n\nTokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT):\n　Atsushi Chitose: The class will help students deepen their understanding of related theories through in-depth review of literature in particular fields directly related to their doctoral dissertation research and enable them to clarify the academic significance and originality of their research. After they have almost finalized their research concept and research plans, students will move ahead with preparing to collect related data through search of published statistics, field studies, etc.\n\n　Yoshiro Nomura: Group reading and discussion of important previous research literature in biological resources functional chemistry will be further continued to help students finalize their research plans. The class will also help students acquire specialized knowledge and skills in related fields and enable them to clearly explain the academic and social contributions of their research.\n\n　Hiroko Katori: Group reading and discussion of previous research literature in energy science will be further continued to help students gain specialized knowledge and skills in the field, and at the same time acquire the capability to adapt to various problems that arise in pursuing research. Students will also substantiate their research themes through discussions with faculty members.\n\n　Kazuhiko Misawa: The class will enable students to clarify the significance and originality of their research themes in view of cutting-edge research trends and social needs in biomedical engineering, as well as to clearly explain the academic contributions of their research.\n\nThe University of Electro-Communications (UEC):\n　Kayoko Yamamoto: Group reading and discussion of important previous research literature in social systems engineering will be further continued to help students finalize their research plans. The class will also help students acquire specialized knowledge and skills in related fields and enable them to clearly explain the academic and social contributions of their research.\n\n　Tomonori Hashiyama: The class will help students substantiate their research themes in view of the latest research trends in computer science and informatics/telecommunications engineering.
