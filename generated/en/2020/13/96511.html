We will update this information as soon as it is decided.＞\n\nTo realize a sustainable symbiotic society, it's necessary to turn our attention to not only symbiotic relations between humans and nature obstructed by environmental destruction, but also the alienated relations between humans and humans brought by it. For example, the situation around food in Japan which has extremely low self-sufficiency ratio has had huge influences on the lives of overseas people who export food to Japan. 3.11 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant accident exposed the reality with the distorted relations in the energy production between urban and rural areas. It is also necessary to pay attention to the social economical structures that have caused the environmental disruption at local and global levels as above, in order to envisage a symbiotic society. In this lecture, first I confirm where such structural problems obstructing symbiosis exist, from the viewpoints of food and energy that are essential for human lives. Secondly, I introduce suggestive thoughts and practices for a design of the symbiotic society.\n・There is a possibility of changing to online lectures.","expected_learning":"1．Understand the basic viewpoints of the idea of symbiotic society\n2．Understand the same roots of human and natural destruction\n3．Be able to show symbiotic society in one’s own way\n","course_schedule":"1) Global structural problems to obstruct our symbiosis:　from the viewpoint of food system\n2) Obstructed Symbiosis between urban and rural areas:　putting focus on the problem of energy production\n3) Envisaging the symbiosis society based on the inhabitants’ participation\n※There is a possibility that the class contents will be corrected according to the progress situation of the lecture.\n","prerequisites":"Students are recommended to prepare for and review the classes as described above, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Nothing special.
