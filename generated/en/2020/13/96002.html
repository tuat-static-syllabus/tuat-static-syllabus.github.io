Each lecture is 90 minutes long, and 12 lectures will be given in 3 consecutive days. The lecture will be held in universities of united graduate school of agricultural science (Ibaraki University, Utsunomiya University, and TUAT.) at same time, so students will be able to take the lecture at their own university.\nThe lecture will be given in English for Comprehensive Agricultural Science II. The title and the teacher of each lecture will be informed later. If you are going to register this subject, please submit the registration form before the deadline.\nEvaluation will be decided by the number of lectures student attended. The attendance will be confirmed by submitting “attendance card” and a report for each lecture. If you are more than ten minutes late for the class, you will not receive the attendance card.\nStudent will be required to attend 5 lectures or more to get a credit, but the numbers of lectures can not be combined with the lectures of former term, or another year. Please keep in mind that it is effective only in one term.","expected_learning":"To understand the studies and its applications on wide range of agricultural science.","course_schedule":"Lecture１ 2020.11.18（Wed）9:10〜10:40\nThe relationship between natural disasters and human society\n-Focusing on the relationship between human society and forest -\n（人間社会と自然災害の関係　－森林と人間社会の関係に着目して－）\nSHUIN, Yasuhiro 　(Utsunomiya University)　\n執印　康裕 (宇都宮大学農学部教授)\n\nLecture2 2020.11.18（Wed）10:50〜12:20\nSustainable land management (SLM) for climate change mitigation and adaptation\n（気候変動緩和・適応のための持続可能な土地管理（SLM））\nTSUNEKAWA, Atsushi 　(Tottori University)　\n恒川　篤史 (鳥取大学乾燥地研究センター教授)\n\nLecture3 2020.11.18（Wed）13:20〜14:50\nApplications and studies of stress responses of organisms from microbe to human being using OMICS biology\n（OMICS生物学による微生物および高等生物ストレス応答機構の解明と利用）\nIWAHASHI, Hitoshi 　(Gifu University)　\n岩橋　均 (岐阜大学応用生物科学部教授)\n\nLecture4 2020.11.18（Wed）15:00〜16:30\nHealth effects of koji glycosylceramide\n（麹グリコシルセラミドの健康効果）\nKITAGAKI, Hiroshi 　(Saga University)　\n北垣 浩志 (佐賀大学農学部教授)\n\nLecture5 2020.11.19（Thu）9:10〜10:40\nYeast Genetic and Molecular Cell Biology and its applications\n（酵母における遺伝学・分子細胞生物学とその応用）\nTABUCHI, Mitsuaki 　(Kagawa University)　\n田淵　光昭 (香川大学農学部教授)\n\nLecture6 2020.11.19（Thu） 10:50〜12:20　Photosynthetic CO2 assimilation in higher plants and some attempts for its improvement\n（高等植物における光合成炭酸同化とその強化の試み）\nSUZUKI, Yuji 　(Iwate University)　\n鈴木　雄二 (岩手大学農学部准教授)\n\nLecture7 2020.11.19（Thu）13:20〜14:50\nDrugs of microbial origin\n（微生物が作る薬）\nHASUMI, Keiji 　(Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology)　\n蓮見　惠司 (東京農工大学農学研究院教授)\n\nLecture8 2020.11.19（Thu）15:00〜16:30\nBioactive peptides: promises for human therapy\n（機能性ペプチド：ヒト治療への可能性）\nIBRAHIM Hisham 　(Kagoshima University)　\nイブラヒム　ヒッシャム (鹿児島大学農学部教授)\n\nLecture9 2020.11.20（Fri）9:10〜10:40\nOverview of Food-Water-Energy Nexus in India\n（インド半乾燥地域における食料・エネルギー・水の連環）\nSATO, Takahiro 　(Hirosaki University)　\n佐藤　孝宏 (弘前大学農学生命科学部准教授)\n\nLecture10 2020.11.20（Fri）10:50〜12:20\nPlant disease control\n（植物病害防除）\nUENO, Makoto 　(Shimane University)　\n上野　誠 (島根大学生物資源科学部教授)\n\nLecture11 2020.11.20（Fri）13:20〜14:50\nForest products industry　-Pulp and paper technology-\n（林産工業－紙パルプ技術概論－）\nICHIURA, Hideaki 　(Kochi University)　\n市浦　英明 (高知大学教育研究部教授)\n\nLecture12 2020.11.20（Fri）15:00〜16:30\nAvian Reproduction　-From Behavior to Molecules-\n（鳥類の生殖－行動から分子まで－）\nSASANAMI, Tomohiro 　(Shizuoka University)　\n笹浪　知宏 (静岡大学学術院農学領域教授)\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Provided before the lecture","assessment":"It will be graded by reports you have submitted","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Please make an appointment","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/29/2020 4:58:35 PM","name":{"id":1629,"ja":"総合農学概論Ⅱ(英語）","en":"Comprehensive Agricultural Science(in English)"},"instructor":{"id":199,"ja":"高栁 正夫","en":"TAKAYANAGI Masao"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"United Graduate School Agricultural Science","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
