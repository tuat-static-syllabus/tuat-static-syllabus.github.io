In recent years, the molecular mechanism of the endocrine control of animal production has been elucidated in livestock. In this regard, this lecture gives extensive knowledge on molecular endocrinological regulation of animal production, especially poultry production, by learning recent advance on avian biology. In addition, applicative possibility of genetic polymorphism in hormone genes toward the improvement of productivity will be discussed.\n\n・There is a possibility of changing to online lectures.","expected_learning":"1. Summarize the control mechanism of egg laying and incubation behavior in chicken.\n2. The relationship between chicken ovary development and energy metabolism can be discussed.\n3. Explain the improvement in productivity and marker-assisted selection in poultry.\n\nFirst and second matters mainly aim to acquire advanced agricultural expertise and third matter mainly applies extensive applied expertise and insight.\n","course_schedule":"1. Molecular endocrine regulation of egg laying and incubation behavior in chicken\n2. Control of early development of the chicken ovary by appetite-regulating hormones\n3.
