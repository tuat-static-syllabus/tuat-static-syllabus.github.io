Most of important agronomic trait is a quantitative trait. Recently, genetic studies of quantitative traits in crops are actively conducted through genome sequencing and development of DNA markers. Analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) can reveal molecular mechanisms to determine quantitative traits as well as contributing to crop breeding in an efficient way.
