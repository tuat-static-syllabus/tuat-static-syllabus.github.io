We will update this information as soon as it is decided.\n\nPlant hormones: physiological roles, action mechanism and application in agriculture.\n\nPlant growth, development and response to environmental signals are regulated by various plant hormones. Last 10 years, our knowledge on plant hormone biology has been surprisingly increased by using novel technologies of molecular genetics, analytical chemistry and developmental biology. In this course, I will talk about the roles of plant hormones, mainly auxin and cytokinin, in plant development and adaptation to environment at molecular and chemical basis.
