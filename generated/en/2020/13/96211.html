Thus far, its main function is considered to maintain tissue structure. Recently, ECM has received attention due to its regulatory function to cell behavior as well as application as functional foods. In this lecture, I will explain the functions of main components of ECM as well as their characteristics and application as food ingredients. This class is designed to acquire advanced expertise in the field of molecular physiology by learning the latest knowledge and technology in agriculture. The lesson format is lecture-centric.\n","expected_learning":"・Ability to explain main components of ECM as well as their physiological function.\n・Ability to explain application of ECM as functional foods.\n・Ability to develop novel research content and application of ECM\n・Please refer to the curriculum map of the course guide for the correspondence between the contents of this lecture and the diploma policy of this course.\n","course_schedule":"・Review of ECM\n・Structure and function of main component of ECM\n・Application of ECM as functional food\n・After the lecture, a confirmation test (required time of 15 minutes) will be conducted.\n・Require submission of report related to this lecture at a later date.
