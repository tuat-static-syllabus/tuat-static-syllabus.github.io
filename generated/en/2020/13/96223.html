Foods must be manufactured with consideration for consumer food safety and security. This lecture will focus on polysaccharides, proteins, oil and fats (including surfactants), and learn about their role and functionality in processed foods and processed foods.\n・ This course is a course designed to acquire advanced specialized skills in the field of applied life science by learning the latest knowledge and technology in agriculture.\n・ Classes are conducted in the form of small classes. I will show some familiar processed foods, and deepen the understanding of the functionality of various physical function materials in foods.\n","expected_learning":"・ Evaluate grades with the issue report. The degree of understanding is evaluated by asking questions about the functionality of bioactive substances related to food processing and quality.\n・ Explain the role and functionality of active substances contained in various agricultural resources, especially substances that have physical functions related to processability and quality of processed foods. Furthermore, students can design various processed foods by using/choosing these active substances useful for manufacturing.\n・ This lecture corresponds to the Diploma Policies ① and ④ of the Department of Applied Life Sciences. For details, please refer to the curriculum map of the course guide.\n","course_schedule":"This lecture is an intensive lecture and explains the following contents.\n　 1) Colloids and hydrocolloids: Functionality of polysaccharides related to food quality\n　 2) Emulsified foods and emulsifiers: Evaluation of surface activity and functionality of oils and fats and\n　　　emulsifiers\n　 3) Dairy foods: Functionality of proteins and polysaccharides related to the quality of dairy foods\nIn addition, the content described above may be modified according to the progress of the class.\n","prerequisites":"Refer to the distributed lecture materials and reference books for preparation and review.","texts_and_materials":"Classes are conducted with PowerPoint and the handouts will be prepared every time.","assessment":"Class participation attitude (30%): Check proficiency through Q & A during class.
