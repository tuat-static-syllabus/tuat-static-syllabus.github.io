Some of the previous great scientific results, even if these seemed to have little relation to the morphological fields, were led by the findings in the morphological fields. In this lecture, some of these previous episodes will be introduced. Then, this lecture will give students the opportunities to consider the relations between the morphology and their own research for the doctoral thesis.\n・There is a possibility of changing to online lectures.","expected_learning":"？ Each student will be familiar with the morphology of animals, especially in the respective subjected species.\n？ Each student will be familiar with the morphology of the system, organ and tissues of their own research subject, and will be able to explain the relationship between the morphology and function.\n","course_schedule":"1.
