The recent progress in the science of plant physiology is remarkable. We deal with the field of plant physiology concerning plant production, i.e. the husbandry and breeding of field and horticultural crops in “plant production physiology”. In the lecture, recent progresses will be introduced on some selected topic and perspectives will be given.\n","expected_learning":"1.　　　Explain limiting factors of leaf photosynthetic rate\n2. Explain limiting factors of canopy photosynthetic rate\n3. Explain the changes in C3 and C4 photosynthesis under increasing CO2 concentration and global warming\n4. Explain rubisco and photorespiration.\n","course_schedule":"1. Limiting factors of leaf photosynthetic rate\n2. Carbon fixation from leaves to crop canopies\n3.
