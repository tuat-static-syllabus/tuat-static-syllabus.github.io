The silkworms have been bred in order to get silk thread by human being during several thousand years. The silkworm cannot survive in the outdoors in spite of Lepidoptera insect. The silkworm which does not require a rearing box to prevent to escaping occupies an important position as a laboratory animal / study material. Bombyx mori was the second to have its genome mapped.\nWe introduce some studies of the field of development / genetics from the studies of the silkworm to be outstanding in the world. You will get scientific knowledge and deepening of biological interest by understanding the contents.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding of reproduction , development and genetics of insect","course_schedule":"1.
