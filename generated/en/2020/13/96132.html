To defend themselves against these microorganisms, plants have evolved elaborate immunity systems that are composed of two main resistance: PAMP-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity. The model of this evolutionary processes leading to these two immunity systems were described in “zig-zag model” in 2006 by Jones and Dangl. Many findings in these 15 years have supported this model, as well as proposed novel concepts about plant-pathogen interactions. This lecture will talk about the basic concept of “zig-zag model,” as well as its application to plant-virus interactions.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding the co-evolutionary process of plant-pathogen interactions based on “zig-zag model.”\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1.
