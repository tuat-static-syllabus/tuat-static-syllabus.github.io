June　17 -Fri., June 19, 2020\nRoom with multi point control distant lecturing system\n【Ibaraki University】\nRoom B, 2nd Floor, Kobushi building, College of Agriculture\n【Utsunomiya University】\nConference Room, 3rd floor,\nMine-machi Building No.3 (Agricultural Common Research\nBuilding) Utsunomiya University\n【Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology】\n2nd Conference Room, 4th floor, Main Building of United\nGraduate School of Agricultural Science\n\nIntroduction and outline of the studies and its applications on a wide range of agricultural science, which is studied in the major fields of United Graduate School of Agricultural Science, is presented by using multi point control distant lecturing system, the network system connects 18 universities across Japan. Each lecture is 90 minutes long, and 12 lectures will be given in 3 consecutive days. The lecture will be held in universities of united graduate school of agricultural science (Ibaraki University, Utsunomiya University, and TUAT.) at same time, so students will be able to take the lecture at their own university.\nThe lecture will be given in English for Comprehensive Agricultural Science II. The title and the teacher of each lecture will be informed later. If you are going to register this subject, please submit the registration form before the deadline.\nEvaluation will be decided by the number of lectures student attended. The attendance will be confirmed by submitting “attendance card” and a report for each lecture. If you are more than ten minutes late for the class, you will not receive the attendance card.\nStudent will be required to attend 5 lectures or more to get a credit, but the numbers of lectures can not be combined with the lectures of former term, or another year. Please keep in mind that it is effective only in one term.","expected_learning":"To understand the studies and its applications on wide range of agricultural science.","course_schedule":"Lecture１\nBasic technologies for biomass refinery related to SDGs and its development.
