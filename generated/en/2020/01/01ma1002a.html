In this course, we will learn the differentiations and the integrations of various functions of one variable and their properties. We will practice advanced computations in this course rather than in high schools.\n\nTakayuki Okuda (a part-time lecturer) will be in charge of this course.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiations and the integrations of various functions, such as polynomials, rational and irrational functions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions,\n(2) to understand how to calculate extreme maximal and minimum values of functions, and\n(3) to be capable of performing practical computations on determining areas of figures and lengths of curves.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )","course_schedule":"1. Continuity of real numbers, and limits of sequences\n2. Limits and continuity of functions\n3. Differentiability of functions, and differential calculus\n4.

Fundamental theorem of calculus\n11. Integral calculus\n12. Integrations of rational functions, possibly containing trigonometric functions and irrational expressions\n13. Improper integrals\n14. Plane curve\n15.
