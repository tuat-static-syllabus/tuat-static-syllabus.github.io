In the basic section, we learn about cells which are units of life, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids which are constituents. Finally, unit testing is carried out. In applied version, we understand the function of biopolymer, especially biochemistry of extracellular matrix, and learn about its function and application. In the lecture, points important to each item are indicated in the form of a question in the form of \"point of understanding\", and students are expected to understand important points by taking lectures while considering answers to the questions. There are many technical terms in this field, since \"terms\" to be acquired as knowledge are organized and presented, it is also utilized for preparation / review to acquire knowledge on biopolymers systematically want.","expected_learning":"1. In the basic section, review of biochemistry.\n2. In the applied section, the study of actual use in companies.\n3.
