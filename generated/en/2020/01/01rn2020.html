Some problems are pointed out that centralizing biomass scattered widely may not contribute to control global warming and conflicting between foods and biofuels. The followings will be explained on the basis of the abovementioned issues; the significance of biomass energy use in Japan, the economic aspect and political strategy, challenges on international corporation, biomass production system in agriculture and forestry, collection and processing of biomass, energy and material flow analysis, relationship between natural ecosystem, regional try to use biomass.","expected_learning":"1. Understand the relationship between use of biomass and agriculture/forestry production activities, conserving natural ecosystem and global environment.\n2. Understand present situation and challenges on the necessary technologies and system for producing/utilizing biomass.\n3.
