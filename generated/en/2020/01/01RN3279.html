In this course, students learn EIA theories, methods, regulations and its historical process with several case studies. Scientific aspects such as predictions and evaluation methods as well as democratic aspects relating to public participation will be explained. We will also explore “strategic environmental assessment” as new areas of EIA. Partially, some classes are conducted by practitioners such as a JICA expert.","expected_learning":"(1) To be able to explain what is EIA, and learn/understand followings\n(2) purposes and methods of screening and scoping\n(3) mini/concise assessment\n(4) EIA system in Japan and foreign countries\n(5) survey, forecasting and evaluation methods\n(6) strategic Environmental Assessment\n(7) roles of EIA for the international cooperation\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy.
