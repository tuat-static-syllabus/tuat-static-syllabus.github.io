This lecture is an important subject in various fields related to ecology and fields related to modeling and simulation. In particular, it is a compulsory subject in the agricultural environmental engineering program and the ecosystem conservation program, and it is a recommended course in the forest science program.\n【Overview】\nPopulation ecology is described as mathematical ecology. It is important to understand concepts such as density dependence, environmental capacity, competition, etc. as models described by differential equations.\nWe deal with continuous system Malthus growth, logistic growth, Lotka-Volterra competition system, Lotka ・ Volterra rey-predator system, structured model, discrete system logistic model etc Learn the fundamentals of nonlinear dynamics using a discrete logistic model.\nLearn numerical solutions of differential equations using Matlab and Octave. Homework is numerical experiment (simulation) of each model. By doing this, students learn the principles of mathematical ecology, modeling and simulation together. All these materials are uploaded to Moodle, and lectures are done using this.\n","expected_learning":"Understand the basic principle of population ecology.\nUnderstand the basic models of mathematical ecology and solve them by numerical solution methods.\nUnderstand the program code written in Matlab or Octave.\nRun a program written in Matlab or Octave to get a solution.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\nURL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1.
