I will teach you to learn from the chemical biology perspective, which has recently been established as a new concept in Europe and the United States. Through these, I think that you should think about what it means to acquire scientific thinking abilities and expressive ability = explanatory ability more widely and make use of it in future scientific activities.","expected_learning":"We can understand physiological phenomena of organism via low molecular physiologically active molecule. For example, the growth of plants can be controlled by: (1) regulation by biosynthesis of plant hormones; (2) acceptance and communication; (3) structure and action of unexplained hormones (new physiologically active substances), and grounds considered as hormones Learn ability to explain in a viewpoint, to be able to explain. We will use this as the standard reach criterion.","course_schedule":"[Rewritten on April 20, 2020]\n\nIn fiscal 2020, face-to-face lectures will not be possible due to the spread of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infection and the declaration of emergency (April 7th to May 6th, 2020). Therefore, we would like to proceed with the lectures by purchasing textbooks and conducting self-study on their own without conducting face-to-face lectures.\n\nAn outline of the contents of the lecture,\n\n① Those who wish to take the course should purchase the following textbooks. We are notified that the product cannot be handled at the co-op, so we apologize for the inconvenience, but please order it at Amazon or the nearest bookstore and purchase it yourself. Please obtain it by May 31st.\nHiromichi Nagasawa (Author) Bioorganic Chemistry-Focusing on bioactive substances-Second Edition (Tokyo Kagaku Dojin 2019, 2600 yen + tax)\nISBN 978-4-8079-0955-1\n[Be careful not to buy the old version]\n\n② Until the face-to-face lecture on June 1st,\nThere is a large academic society on agricultural life sciences called the Japan Society for Agricultural Chemistry. Japanese journals published by the society\nFrom [Chemistry and Biology] magazine\nSearch for articles and papers related to \"bioactive substances,\" download the ones you are interested in, and report them to the lecturer. By noon every Friday, students should report the paper they are interested in to Kawade, and report the paper they read by the next week in 200 to 400 characters.\n\nChemistry and Biology; URL of the browsing site\nhttps://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/kagakutoseibutsu/list/-char/ja\n\nThere is a search in the journal.\nIf you enter a keyword such as \"bioactive substance\", \"antibiotic\" or \"plant hormone\", a list of papers etc. extracted by that keyword will appear. The publication date of the papers is not limited, but it seems that the papers after the 1980s are good. Thesis can be downloaded as PDF (marked as [Free]). You do not need to download the papers that are charged.\n\n③ After June 1st, when the face-to-face lecture is scheduled, the lecture will proceed based on the textbook you purchased.\n\n④ If you cannot start the face-to-face lecture on June 1, proceed as follows.\n\n[Bioorganic Chemistry-Centering on Bioactive Substances-Second Edition]\nIt is composed of Chapters 1 to 5 (total 190 pages) and summarizes bioactive substances from various viewpoints.\nParticipants should freely divide each of Chapters 1 to 5 into 5 units and create one question as a quiz from each unit. Instead of a report, please set up a question that holds true as a quiz.\nThen, please give the answer by yourself. (This is important for getting a problem that you can solve)\n\nIn other words, the participants should think about five quizzes about topics extracted from chapters 1 to 5 and carry out the tasks to answer them.\n\nDuring the lecture period, from June 5th (Friday) to July 3rd (Friday), please submit five small exam questions and answers by e-mail to the teacher.\nAfter being corrected, the faculty member evaluates the quality of the question / answer example that you asked for (whether you can read the intent of the questioner who asked why the question was created).\n\nFor those who cannot submit it by e-mail, you can write it by hand and mail it. We will correct and comment with red pencil and return it as a mail or PDF.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please write down your name, student ID number and mail address, and consult the lecturer's teacher by email.\nLecture teacher: Hiroshi Kawade (hkawaide@cc.tuat.ac.jp)","prerequisites":"People who can prepare and review can take courses. Also, we will distribute the attendance table at the beginning of the lecture. I am thinking of the aggressiveness that I can describe and submit questions and doubts, points that I've learned to do by myself, etc. as a course condition.\nAs related subjects, organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetic engineering, plant physiology, etc. will help you to understand. It is possible to see physiologically active substances from a wide viewpoint. Both students who are good at chemistry and students who are good at biology are aiming for content that can satisfy intellectual curiosity.","texts_and_materials":"I list them as below. The textbook is written in Japanese.","assessment":"Assess the quality and content of the five quizzes.\nWhen face-to-face lectures become possible, I will excerpt and explain excellent quizzes.\nWe are thinking of having you answer the good questions.","message_from_instructor":"This year is the last one because the lecture on bioactive substance chemistry is a lecture on the old curriculum.\nUnfortunately this year, I cannot fully convey what I want to convey in the lecture, but reading one textbook on bioactive substances is a good way to understand organic chemistry on bioactive substances in agriculture. I think it will be a property.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/20/2020 1:06:21 PM","name":{"id":183,"ja":"生理活性物質化学","en":"Bioactive Material Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":162,"ja":"川出 洋","en":"KAWAIDE Hiroshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":14,"min":3},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Fri.2","references":"Articles published by high quality top journals (PNAS, nature and related journals, JBC, JACS, Angew.
