Co. Inc.) will give a lecture on how scientific knowledge of microbiology, biochemistry, molecular microbiology so on, has been put to practical use in industry. It will give you a deep understanding from the basic concept of metabolic engineering at the early stage till the cutting-edge technologies, following some examples of strain breeding for amino acid production.","expected_learning":"・Have a deep understanding on usefulness and expectation of biotechnology, learning the development of Metabolic Engineering historically.\n・Learn the cutting-edge biotechnologies and their application to practical productions, and make a basic foundation in generating the student’s own idea.\n・Have an point of view from application research by looking back some case studies of practical development.\n\n","course_schedule":"　In 1908, Dr. Ikeda extracted glutamic acid as a component of the deliciousness of seaweed and named it the 5th basic taste \"umami\", which differs from the 4 basic tastes. This was the first innovation in the amino acid industry and led to the creation of the amino acid business based on the extraction method. Launching “AJI-NO-MOTO” is also the world’s first creation of “UMAMI seasoning business”, leading industry-academia collaboration and open-innovation.\nThen the second innovation, Corynebacterium glutamicum was discovered in 1957 in Japan as a natural producer of glutamate and industrial production of glutamate by “fermentation” has begun. This is the start of the amino acid fermentation. Amino acid fermentation has been expanded not only glutamate but also other amino acids and several technologies were developed. Recently, researches to design and construct biological systems for various useful products, even non-natural products has been active.\n　In this lecture, theory of metabolic engineering for strain breeding will be introduced following some practical cases of amino acid producer. Besides, development researches, that is utilization of various low materials, process developments (scale-up, fermentation, and purification), facilities, environmental and energy measures, patent strategy and so on will be described with concrete examples. I hope you could realize how scientific knowledge such as Metabolic engineering, Biochemical engineering, DNA recombination and Synthetic biology, you are learning, has put to practical use in industry. Also, it could serve you an opportunity to think your future path.\n\nThe First Day (23th, May)\n・Application of microbial metabolism in industry/ Metabolic engineering approach\n・Discovered of umami and creation of amino acids business. / Novel function of glutamate.\n・Discovered of glutamate production microorganisms. /Why microorganism is used?\n・Elucidation of mechanism of glutamate overproduction.\n・Utilization of various C-sources.\nThe Second Day (30th, May)\n・Breeding of strain by DNA recombination technology.\n・Case study：Breeding of lysine producing strains.\n・DNA recombination technology and its regulation.\n・Process developments of fermentation Facilities\n・Economical evaluation of fermentation industry.\n・Evolution of metabolic engineering\n・Case study/Innovative pathway design for glutamate production.\nThe Third Day (20th, June)\n・Purification process and quality insurance.\n・Case study/ Tryptophan fermentation and\n・Environmental measures.\n・Case study/ Glutamic acid fermentation under acidic condition.\n・Enzymation technology for industry. Expansion of protein engineering technology.\n・Case study/Development of phosphotransferase for nucleosides production.\nThe Fourth Day (27th, June)\n・Patent strategy\n・Case study/Analysis of competition on development of cysteine producers from open patents.\n・Future of metabolic engineering: Biofuel, White biotechnology, Synthetic biology\n・Case study/ Development of succinic acid producer.\n・Question and answer session.","prerequisites":"Students are assumed to have basic knowledge on Biochemistry and Microbiology.","texts_and_materials":"None in particular.
