The hydrology is study to learn a state and a change of the water on the earth from the situation of the water cycle, and the study field includes the land such as a river, wetlands and the groundwater. In addition, atmospheric water vapor movement is important to water cycle, and this has a big influence on the formation of the world division into climatic zones and a climate change. Water cycle is extremely important to understand an ecology.\nStudents will learn the theory and influence of the water cycle in the earth, rainfall infiltration, the outflow of evaporation, transpiration, the rainwater in forest.","expected_learning":"Students understand that the water cycle and heat circulation are closely related to the weather forecast. And, students understand the mechanism of natural disaster due to a water cycle and water in the mountainous district and city area.\n\nPlease refer to the curriculum map on the University's website (three policies) for diploma policy perspectives\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1. What is the hydrology? outline of hydrology\n2. Global scale water cycle, the heat balance\n3. Division of climatic zones, outline of meteorology\n4. Water and heat flux in the earth surface (forest, grassland, bare land)\n5. Global warming and climate change\n6. Use of the water by agricultural production, the social activity\n7. Observation of rainfall and characteristic of distribution of the precipitation\n8. Midterm examination second to the seventh\n9. Water management by the basin unit, flood control\n10. Rainfall-discharge process, flood outflow and available water\n11. Soil water movement at the slope and water permeability and retentivity\n12. Theory of soil water movement at the slope\n13. Runoff analysis\n14. Green dam function, paired watershed methods in the world\n15. Sum up and final examination, 9th to 14th\n","prerequisites":"Please perform preparations, review (out-of-class learning).\nThe required study time is based on the standard hours of the university.\n","texts_and_materials":"Distribute copies for text","assessment":"Report score(20%), midterm exam.(40%), term exam.(40%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/19/2020 11:16:17 AM","name":{"id":330,"ja":"水文学","en":"Hydrology"},"instructor":{"id":324,"ja":"白木 克繁","en":"SHIRAKI Katsushige"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Wed.1","references":""}}
