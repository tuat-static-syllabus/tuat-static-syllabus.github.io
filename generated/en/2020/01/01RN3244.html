The lectures provide indispensable matter in agricultural production and agricultural land conservation, understanding of condition which productive crop land supposed to have, and concerning knowledge and practical methodology.\nThis course is taught by the instructor who has experience in land reclamation project for paddy field in Japan and overseas. The lectures consist of examples of real project of land reclamation for paddy field.","expected_learning":"Students gain basic understanding and are able to explain about basic characteristics of soils and water movement in paddy fields and upland fields, irrigation and drainage, farm land consolidation.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"1：class orientation：Course objectives, contents, schedule, Introduction to Environmental Rural Engineering.\n2：“what is paddy fields?“・・・rice cultivation, soils in paddy field, structure of paddy field.\n3：”Water movement in paddy field 1”・・・irrigation in paddy field\n4：”Water movement in paddy field 2”・・・percolation in paddy field\n5：“Water movement in paddy field 3“　・・・drainage in paddy field\n6：“Water movement in paddy field 4“　・・・bearing capacity of paddy field and multi-purpose paddy field\n7：“Reclamation of rice paddy 1“・・・farm land consolidation of rice paddy, structure of the field\n8：“Reclamation of rice paddy 2“・・・Farm land consolidation：paddy field reclamation in Lake Basin Development Authority in Kenya\n9：　Summary of paddy field Environmental rural engineering：\n10：\"Water movement in upland field 1\"・・・1.

Therefore overall understandings of the subjects such as soil science, crop production, hydrology, agricultural meteorology, agricultural practice, agricultural economics is recommended. However, the most important thing is students’ motivation in attending the course. Important subject for attending this course may be soil physics. Students will be exposed for environmental impact assessment and agricultural land consolidation and management as well as agricultural land conservation concerning ecosystem. Pre-study and lecture review (including home works) require standard course hours.　Textbook below will be used for the lecture and Pre-study and lecture review including home works.","texts_and_materials":"Agricultural field environmental engineering 2nd edition, Ed.
