International discussion is actively promoted around the maintenance and management of forest resources and marine resources on a global scale. Economic activities that consider the sustainability of biological resources, including the management of genetic resources and the reduction of food loss, are becoming inevitable. In this lecture, we will take the agriculture, forestry and fishery products as biological resources, consider how global conditions and policies concerning the agriculture, forestry and fisheries industry and products are changing rom the global point of view,\n\nThis lecture is provided by teachers with practical experience.\nAll teachers are the government officers in Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. They have experience of agriculture and forestry administration, and teach the international issues on biological resources in the class.\nSyllabus might change with small modification.","expected_learning":"To understand the current situation and issues inside and outside the biological resources and the contents of policies related to them.\nStudents will make it possible to propose solutions (policy proposals) based on current situation analysis on specific issues concerning biological resources.\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","course_schedule":"Teachers who are planning and devising policies related to biological resources in the seven fields of expertise at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries give the lectures.
