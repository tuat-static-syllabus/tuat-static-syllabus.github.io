The W chromosome of B. mori does not recombine with the Z chromosome and autosomes and no genes for morphological characters have been mapped. Femaleness is determined by presence of a single W chromosome, regardless of the number of autosomes or Z chromosomes. It was found that many long terminal repeat(LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons, retroposons, DNA transposons and their derivatives, have accumulated on the W chromosome as strata.\nA mutant strain of the silkworm, B. mori was proposed as a model for Parkinson’s disease. Homozygous op mutants exhibiting translucent larval integument are reported to exhibit occasional unique actions such as vibration. However, this occasional unique actions of op/op larvae were simply reactions to touch of other larvae.\nAdult horned beetles exhibit bark-carving behaviors to feed on tree sap, in part byusing small projections of the clypeus. However, it was shown that adult horned beetles used their mandibles and no the projections of the clypeus to carve bark.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"The textbook is prepared.","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"am11:00~pm5:00","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/26/2020 1:12:09 PM","name":{"id":298,"ja":"農学基礎ゼミ","en":"Basic Seminar of Agricultural Science"},"instructor":{"id":978,"ja":"阿部 広明","en":"ABE Hiroaki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":2,"min":1,"max":2},"neutral_department":"農学部","category":"教養科目","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"昆虫機能生理化学2号館332室","day_period":"木2","references":""}}
