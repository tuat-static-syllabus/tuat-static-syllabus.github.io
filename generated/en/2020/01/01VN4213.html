Knowledge on this organ pathology plays an introductory role for clinical veterinary medicine. This knowledge also provides basics for toxicopatholological analysis of chemicals using experimental animals. This subject is a course subject by a teacher with practical experience. In charge of toxicology, the instructor has experience in pathological diagnosis in toxicity tests, and gives lectures with examples of lesions in class.","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nPlease refer to the curriculum map of our university HP (3 policies).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\nThere are a variety of diseases including neoplasms that can be observed in farm animals, companion animals and experimental animals. Animal General Pathology is a discipline that deals with the study of responses and rules to all diseases, taking into account all the pathogenic factors and morbid circumstances, which can be found in different animals, but always from a general point of view. The Animal General Pathology includes understanding of basic knowledge necessary for morphological analysis of lesions developed in each disease of animals, as well as acquisition of pathological terms necessary for conduct of diagnosis in practice.\n\nIn the course of Animal Special Pathology B, pathological lesions that appear in following organs in animals are dealt in terms of the understanding of pathogenesis as well as the comparative pathological viewpoint.\n\n1. Urinary system (kidney, ureter, bladder, urethra): For example, (1) can explain the cause, pathogenesis and classification of glomerulonephritis, (2) can explain the pathological features of renal tubular lesions, (3) can explain the pathological features of acute and chronic nephritis, and (4) can explain the pathological features of papillary necrosis and other urinary tract lesions.\n2. Reproductive organs (testis, epididymis, vas deferens, scrotum, male accessory gonads [seminal vesicle, prostate, urethral bulb], penis, foreskin, ovary, fallopian tube, uterus, placenta, cervix, vagina, vulva, mammary gland): For example, 1) explain the cause and pathological features of orchitis, (2) can explain the classification of testicular tumors and ovarian tumors, (3) can explain ovarian and uterine diseases, and (4) can explain the pathological features of infections that cause abnormal birth [abortion, stillbirth].\n3.

Musculoskeletal system (bone, joints, tendons, skeletal muscles): For example, (1) can explain the pathological features of metabolic bone disease and toxic bone disease, (2) can explain the pathological features of bone diseases caused by circulatory disorders, (3) can explain the causes and pathological features of joint disease, (4) can explain the basic lesion of skeletal muscle, (5) can explain the pathological features of inflammatory myopathy, (6) can explain the classification and pathological features of neurogenic myopathy, and (7) can explain the classification and pathological features of myogenic myopathy.\n7.

In addition to the 15 times of class time, refer to the distributed lecture materials, textbooks, reference books, etc. and perform pre / post learning.","texts_and_materials":"Use Animal Special Pathology (2nd Edition), Color Atlas of Animal Pathology (2nd Edition), both being edited by Japanese Society of Veterinary Pathology as textbooks. Powerpoint documents will also be handed out.","assessment":"We will evaluate the grades based on the mid-term and final regular exam scores. Attendance points are not included in the grades, but if students are absent three or more times in classes up to the mid-term exam and in classes after mid-term exam, students will not qualify for the exam. If the score does not reach 60 in each test, perform one additional test.","message_from_instructor":"Pathology is one of the academic disciplines required for the National Veterinary Medical Practitioners Qualifying Examination. Animal Pathology is positioned between basic veterinary classes and clinical classes, and thus, it is necessary to have knowledge on anatomy, histology, immunology, and microbiology to have appropriate understanding of lesions. It will be difficult to have appropriate understandings on clinical classes, such as veterinary surgery and veterinary internal medicine.","course_keywords":"Pathological lesions in major organs, Degenerative changes, Adaptive cellular changes and abnormalities in cellular differentiation, Circulatory disturbances, Inflammation, Immunopathology, Oncology, Malformation.","office_hours":"13:00〜18:30.
