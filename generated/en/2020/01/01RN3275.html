The aspects of 《State-Economics-Society》undergo a dramatic transformation. Overcoming neo-liberal globalization is important. It involves the logic of social subsumption and exclusion. The various problems appear, such as, “poverty and starvation”, environmental crises, gender problem, child labor, “immigrants and refugees”, and “conflicts and violence” etc... On the other hand, the world trend of “decentralization and participation” and the movement of《Rehabilitation of Society》also appear. We will consider the future of social forces.","expected_learning":"This lecture will clear up the relations of 《State-Development-Civil Society》in globalized developing countries (the Global-South) by treating the diverse cases. Of course, 《Development》in the Global-South is various according to the different regional-historic conditions. However, it is very important to discover the construction in the authoritarian structure of 《State and Society》, and to find the demands of people.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"〈The State－Development－Society in the developing country〉(The case study)\n　―The development and politics in Algeria (North Africa)―\n（１）The structure of French colonial rule and the National movement (1830-1954)\n（２）The Algerian War (1954-62)\n（３）The establishment of postcolonial dominant system\nand the developmental policy （Ⅰ）―Ben Bella Regime (1962-65)―\n（４）The establishment of postcolonial dominant system\nand the developmental policy （Ⅱ）―Boumedienne Regime (1965-78)―\n（５）Chadli Regime and the new economic policy /structural adjustment (1979-92) （Ⅰ）\n　　　―The crisis and reorganization of system―\n（６）Chadli Regime and the new economic policy /structural adjustment (1979-92) （Ⅱ）\n　　　―The crisis and reorganization of system―\n（７）The civil war and political-economic reform (1992-99)\n―The disturbance of system―\n（８）Bouteflika Regime and political-economic crisis・Populaire movement(1999-2019)\n　　　―The transformation of system and 《statu quo》\n（９）Post-Bouteflika Regime and development policy (2019-)\n（10）The development of the developing countries (Global south)\n―The methodical reflexion\n―The theory of《The economy of rent and the rentier culture》―（Ⅰ）\n（11）The development of the developing countries (Global south)\n―The methodical reflexion\n―The theory of《The economy of rent and the rentier culture》―（Ⅱ）\n（12）The development of the developing countries (Global south)\n―The methodical reflexion\n―The theory of《The economy of rent and the rentier culture》―（Ⅲ）\n（13）The development of the developing countries (Global south)\n―The methodical reflexion\n―The theory of《The economy of rent and the rentier culture》―（Ⅳ）\n（14）The development of the developing countries (Global south)\n―The methodical reflexion\n―The theory of《The economy of rent and the rentier culture》―（Ⅴ）\n（15）The development of the developing countries (Global south)\n―The methodical reflexion\n―The theory of《The economy of rent and the rentier culture》―（Ⅵ）\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Report","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/6/2020 4:22:15 PM","name":{"id":398,"ja":"国際開発論","en":"International Development Study"},"instructor":{"id":353,"ja":"渡邊 司","en":"WATANABE Tsukasa"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":14,"min":3},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Fri.3","references":"Kiyoshi Matsushita(ed.) “The present of developing countries－State・Development・Civil Society－”\nBenjamin STORA, “The history of Algeria ―the French colonial rule, the war for independence and decolonization.”\nFukuda Kunio, “The transformation of political-economic process for the Third World after independence ―The case of Algeria.”"}}
