In this course, we will first introduce basic concepts and terms of statistics such as means, variances, probability distributions, etc. Then, observing the connection between statistical properties of samples and those of the population, we will learn methods of interval estimation and hypothesis testing.","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is to be capable of\n(1) understanding standard terms and notations of mathematical statistics,\n(2) calculating the mean and standard deviation of a given set of numbers,\n(3) applying normal distribution or Student's t-distribution to estimation of the mean of the population,\n(4) testing a statistical hypothesis by using normal distribution.\n","course_schedule":"1. Summarizing data\n2. Population and sample\n3. Basic characteristics of sample statistics\n4. Relations of two or more statistics\n5. Statistical estimation\n6. Unbiasedness and consistency\n7. Basic concept of hypothesis testing\n8. Application of hypothesis testing\n9. Interval estimation\n10. Goodness-of-fit test\n11. Randomized controlled trial (RCT)\n12. Continuous distribution\n13.
