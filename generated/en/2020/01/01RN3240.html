By the class, we comment on image analysis, an application field from an observation principle about the remote sensing from a satellite. Furthermore, using real remote sensing data, we compose it from a raster display and classification of land surface condition based on supervised classification.","expected_learning":"We understand a principle of the remote sensing and using real data, the method of analysis of natural environments about the local system ecology-like soil, water, vegetation and learn the evaluation technique of the natural environments change in the wide area. I have in particular following goals of getting three points.\n(1) Understand a basic theory about the remote sensing and a measurement principle\n(2) Acquire the basic method of analysis of remote sensing data and their interpretation.\n(3) Utilize knowledge of the remote sensing for regional and global resource management and environmental plan.\n\nDetail information is provided in the following map. https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"(1)Flow of structure and the analysis of the remote sensing\n(2)A sensor and observation method of the remote sensing\n(3)A satellite image and image processing\n(4)Land coverage and classification\n(5)Natural environments by remote sensing\n(6)A hyper spectrum and plane laser instrumentation & measurement practice\n(7)A method of analysis and software With MultiSpec (practice 1)\n(8) spectrum reflection characteristic\n(9)Unsupervised classification (practice 3)\n(10)Supervised classification\n(11)application of natural environments analysis:\n(12) A vegetation index and analysis (practice 5) by NDVI\n(13)Analysis of hyper spectrum data\n(14) Environmental Impact Assessment\n(15) Environmental assessment and interpretation\n(16) Examination","prerequisites":"Practice and review should be conducted with reference materials and handouts.
