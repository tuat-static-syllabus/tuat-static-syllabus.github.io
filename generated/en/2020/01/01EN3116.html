In ordinary and typical lecture of organic chemistry, a wide range of content is classified according to functional groups of organic compounds. As an alternative viewpoint, in this lecture, organic chemistry is classified according to reactions. Therefore, students who take this course necessarily learn not only vertically classification but also horizontally classification of organic chemistry. Importance of reaction mechanism in organic chemistry is to be emphatically focussed on.","expected_learning":"Through this course, students will have deeper understanding of organic reaction mechanisms.","course_schedule":"This course will be proceeded in the same order of contents of the textbook.\nIn necessary, supplementary material will be presented.\n\n1. Chemical bonds and Molecular Structure\n2. Acids and Bases\n3. Expression of Organic Reactions Employing Curved Arrows\n4. Nucleophilic Substitutions and Eliminations\n5.
