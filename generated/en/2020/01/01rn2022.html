This philosophy converted the rational presence from God to a human. In the history of ideas, this conversion was the sea change which unleash the human from medieval values where the God is absolute.\nBy this conversion, we, human beings, have enabled the practice to regard the presence of nature as objects of observation. As a result, the scientific knowledge which had been gradually accumulated raised the industrial revolution. This natural scientific and industrial change is the reason for which we can now enjoy the rich life.\nHowever, on the other hand, the society based on \"mass production-mass consumption\" which brings us the rich life, has led the entire planet into the ecological crisis.\nSo, we are possible to say, one of the most important primary factor which caused the environmental problem is the transformation of philosophical knowledge. Therefore, “Environmental Philosophy” has become necessary today to explore good relationships of human beings and the presence of nature.\nI wish this lecture to be an opportunity, through the overview of Environmental Philosophy, that each of us think deeply about better relationships between human beings and the presence of nature.","expected_learning":"１）Understand what the Environmental Philosophy is\n２）Understand the basic perspective of the relationship between human beings and nature, from the point of view of Environmental Philosophy\n３）Understand the structural factors of occurrence of environmental issues\n４）Spin your own concept of Environmental Philosophy, through learning of ideas and practices to solve various environmental problems\n・Corresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n\n","course_schedule":"【Guidance】What is the “Environmental Philosophy”?\nⅠ　What is the environment for human\n　１）To Human Beings from man①――The environment and development for the individual\n　２）To Human Beings from man②――Blowup the culture and dual inheritance theory that enabled human evolution\n　３）Why do environmental issues arise?\nⅡ　Explore the relationship between man and nature\n　１）Explore the foundation of the relationship between human beings and the presence of nature――Which is the central problem between human or nature?\n　２）Animal Liberation theory and Bioethics\n　３）Think about the life of the human beings\n【Intermediate Summary】\nⅢ　Composition of environmental destruction\n　１）Global structure that results in environmental destruction\n　２）Domestic structure that results in environmental destruction①\n　　　――From the point of view of the victims of the Minamata disease\n　３）Domestic structure that results in environmental destruction②\n　　　――From the point of view of the perpetrators of the Minamata disease\n　４）The composition which leads to pollution――Alienation and Reification\nⅣ　Perspective to spin the Environmental Philosophy\n　１）Possibility of the agricultural philosophy\n　２）Practice to solve environmental problems\n【Final Summary】","prerequisites":"Students are recommended to prepare for and review the classes as described above, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"SAWA,Yoshinari, “Social Dissection by Anthropology and Environmental Studies: Can the human being live alone?” azusa-shuppansya, 2010","assessment":"・class participation 40%：students' questions and comments during the class、contribution to discussion, and comment sheets are taken into account.\n・Final Report 60%：to assess basic knowledge and understanding on Environmental Philosophy and its application to social issues","message_from_instructor":"I expect a positive opinion from you！","course_keywords":"Philosophy, Environmental Problems, Pollution, Alienation, Agricultural Philosophy","office_hours":"Thursday (16:30~18:00)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/24/2020 9:48:33 AM","name":{"id":347,"ja":"環境哲学","en":"Environmental Philosophy"},"instructor":{"id":311,"ja":"澤 佳成","en":"SAWA Yoshinari"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Mon.3","references":"In each lecture, I will introduce the related books and materials."}}
