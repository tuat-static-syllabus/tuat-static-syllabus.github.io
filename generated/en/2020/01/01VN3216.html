And then, practically learn the basics of diagnoses in microbiology. Learning the characteristics of bacteria and virus might leads students to handle bacteria and virus appropriately, and to perform diagnoses using fundamental immunological methods. The contents of this laboratory class is based on the technique learned in Practice in Veterinary Microbiology I laboratory class.","expected_learning":"Practically learn the contents described below.","course_schedule":"Contents are performed over several weeks, and several contents are done simultaneously in one day, depending on the duration of growth or proliferation of cells and pathogens. The schedule is changed every year because of the closing of University by University policy for students committee.\nContents are shown below.\n\n1. Significance and technique of diagnoses of infectious diseases.\n2. Bacterial isolation from animals.\n　　・Staining.\n　　・Inoculation of bacteria into animals.\n　　・Counting live bacteria（spreading）\n　　・Counting live bacteria（evaluation）\n　　・Aseptic sampling\n　　・Staining of bacteria, and evaluation\n3.
