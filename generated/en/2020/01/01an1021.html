Currently, plant molecular breeding using recombinant DNA technique is widely performed in the field of plant production. This technique was developed on the basis of molecular genetics. In this course, students will learn in detail about basic knowledge and technologies necessary to understand the technique, as shown in \"Course schedule\". Specifically, the basics of genetics in the unit 2, the molecular processes of gene expression in the unit 3 to 6, and the control mechanism of gene expression in the unit 7 and 8 will be described in detail. In addition, in the unit 9 to 11, plant breeding using genetic recombination technology will be outlined. Furthermore, in the unit 12 to 14, recent topics in the field of plant molecular genetics will be introduced. This is part of the Courses of Plant Production Science in the Department of Biological Production.","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is that students will be able to understand the process of plant molecular breeding using recombinant DNA technique through the learning about molecular processes and control mechanisms of gene expression, structure of genes and genomes, and procedures of gene manipulation.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"Unit 1: Guidance, Description of this lecture\nUnit 2: Basis of genetics, Structure and function of the gene\nUnit 3: Molecular processes of gene expression (1), Transcription of genetic information\nUnit 4: Molecular processes of gene expression (2), RNA processing\nUnit 5: Molecular processes of gene expression (3), Translation of genetic information 1\nUnit 6: Molecular processes of gene expression (4), Translation of genetic information 2\nUnit 7: Control mechanisms of gene expression (1), Regulation of genetic transcription\nUnit 8: Control mechanisms of gene expression (2), Epigenetic regulation\nUnit 9: Plant molecular breeding using recombinant DNA technique (1)\nUnit 10: Plant molecular breeding using recombinant DNA technique (2)\nUnit 11: Plant molecular breeding using recombinant DNA technique (3)\nUnit 12: Recent topics in plant molecular genetics(1)\nUnit 13: Recent topics in plant molecular genetics(2)\nUnit 14: Recent topics in plant molecular genetics(3)\nUnit 15: Summary of contents of this lecture and final examination","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.

In addition, those techniques will be involved deeper into our lives, and it should be understand as general knowledge. I hope that all students of this course will learn accurately the foundation and application of the molecular ganatics through lectures.","course_keywords":"Gene expression, gene recombination, genetic engineering, molecular breeding, genome, GM crops, epigenetics","office_hours":"It is 12:00 to 13:00 on Monday.
