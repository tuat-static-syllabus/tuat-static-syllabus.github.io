This lecture covers structures and types of proteins, which are typical macromolecules in the organisms, and glycans and lipids, which are macromolecules highly related to the proteins. The lecture also covers the physiological functions, analytical methods, and some applications using these macromolecules.\n[Course objective] This course is a common department subject, and provides topics based on biochemistry.\n","expected_learning":"- Understanding the structures and types of glycans, and also understanding the physiological functions, roles, and their relations to diseases.\n- Understanding the chemistry and analytical methods of protein structures, and also understanding the protein folding and its physiological roles.\n- Understanding the major components and physiological functions of cell membranes and extracellular matrices, which are important for learning of the mechanism of mammalian cells\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: (B)\nPlease refer to the curriculum map at the following URL:\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\n","course_schedule":"Lectures 1 - 5: Takashi Tonozuka\n1) Chemistry of protein structures and folding\n2) Some examples of protein folds\n3) Prediction and databases of protein structures\n4) Mechanism for supporting the protein folding\n5) Methods for protein structure determination\n\nLectures 6 - 10: Yoshihiro Nomura\n6) Introduction of lipids: classification and metabolism\n7) Cell membrane and membrane permeation\n8) Introduction of extracellular matrices\n9) Function of collagens\n10) Inherited diseases\n\nLectures 11 - 15: Shinji Miyata\n11) What “glycans” is: basics, including history of the research, of structures, types, and complex carbohydrates\n12) Biosynthesis of glycoproteins, and diseases related to the glycoproteins\n13) Lectins\n14) Physiological roles of glycans in glycoproteins\n15) Recent topics of glycans: infectious diseases, medicines, diagnostic markers and more.","prerequisites":"Students need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts are provided if needed.","assessment":"Performance in lecture (including mini-tests) (30%) and assignment report or examination (70%)","message_from_instructor":"We hope that this lecture will help you on your research in the future.","course_keywords":"protein, glycan, extracellular matrix","office_hours":"Please contact by e-mail.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"8/24/2020 9:58:34 AM","name":{"id":190,"ja":"蛋白学","en":"Proteomics"},"instructor":{"id":1829,"ja":"殿塚 隆史, 野村 義宏, 宮田 真路","en":"TONOZUKA Takashi, NOMURA Yoshihiro, MIYATA Shinji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":14,"min":3},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Wed.3","references":"McKee Biochemistry, Essential cell biology, etc."}}
