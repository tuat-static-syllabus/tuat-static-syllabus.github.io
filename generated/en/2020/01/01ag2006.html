The Center utilizes virgin forest, secondary forest, farmland, urban green zones and a variety of other fields located within a 100-km area of the Tokyo Metropolis as its Field Museum (FM). Field surveys are conducted for about a week at FMs in order to understand desirable man-nature relationship.","expected_learning":"Criterion for achievment: Obtain the basic skills for making academic reports, by understanding the broad range of practices related to field science. All participants need to attend all lectures of each course.","course_schedule":"We will conduct experimental practice separately in two courses using field museums of FS Center (FM Fuchu, FM Tsukui, FM Tama, FM Karasawayama etc.). The contents of the experimental practice carried out at each FM are as follows.\nFM Fuchu: Experiments on crop cultivation, fruit and gardening, practical training\nFM Tsukui: satoyama environment and biota, environmental education etc.\nFM Tama Hills: Air environment training, Forest environment survey training etc.\nFM Karasawayama: Environmental education practice etc.\n\nThe menus of practice and used FM in each course are different.\nDetails of the contents of each course will be explained in the guidance conducted in April, so please be sure to attend the course applicant.\nFor each course, the maximum number of students is 40.\n\n\n","prerequisites":"Before registration, please inquire with the instructor (Tomohiro Yoshida, yoshitom@cc.tuat.ac.jp) about the details of this subject.","texts_and_materials":"We provide a handout accordingly.","assessment":"70% or more of attendance is a condition of credit acquisition.
