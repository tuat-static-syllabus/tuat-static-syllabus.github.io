In this class, basic knowledge on soil science and ecology and biogeochemical cycles at global scale and will be lectured. In the first half, I will have a talk on development of soils, diversity and ecology of soil biota, soil structure and function. In the latter half, I will have a talk on roles of soils in global biogeochemistry, soil degradation, and agricultural and environmental issues based on the big history of Earth for 4.6 billion years, soil history for 5 hundreds of million years, and human history for 7 million years.","expected_learning":"Students can acquire knowledge on (1) how diverse soils are formed on Earth, what differentiates Earth soil from rock, Martian or Lunar soil, (2) interactions between soils and environmental or agricultural issues from a viewpoint of biogeochemistry, and (3) skills to extract a key process from complicated ecological phenomena.","course_schedule":"This course is composed of the following topics:\n(1) Surface environment and soil of Earth (Rock weathering, Martian or Lunar soil)\n(2) Clay minerals and organic matter (charges and physical characteristics)\n(3) Soil microbiology (microbes, archaea, and virus)\n(4) Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus biogeochemical cycles in ecosystems\n(5) archea Human evolution and soil degradation (civilization, salinization, acidification)\n(6) Agricultural issues and soils (erosion, non-tillage, pesticide)\n(7) Environmental issues and soils (climate change, energy, terraforming)\nSeveral examinations, presentation, and debate will be conducted for active learning.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Prepare based on the necessity","assessment":"Evaluating submitted master thesis","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Research project, objective, method, analysis, discussion","office_hours":"By the demand　fkazumichi@yahoo.co.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"12/20/2019 11:07:00 AM","name":{"id":2425,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅷ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅧ"},"instructor":{"id":2037,"ja":"楊 宗興, 藤井 一至, 熊田 英峰, 中田 典秀","en":"YO Muneoki, KUMATA Hidetoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Prepare based on the necessity"}}
