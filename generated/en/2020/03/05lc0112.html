Cells are separated from the outside by the cell membrane, and organelles are surrounded by the organelle membrane. Each of these biological membranes is formed to have a characteristic shape and an appropriate size, and abnormal morphogenesis of the membrane can cause diseases in human. In this lecture, you will learn about the molecular mechanism of morphogenesis of biological membranes. In addition, we will learn about yeast genetics research, which has been useful in elucidating various biological phenomena including biological membrane formation.\n\nYAOI, Katsuro (AIST, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology)\nThe “enzyme” is industrially used in various fields as a “biocatalyst having a low environmental load”, and enzymatic reactions are performed at normal temperature and pressure. Industrial enzymes are mainly produced by microorganisms, and to study the enzymes, obtaining of novel useful microorganisms, analysis of biochemical properties and three-dimensional structure determination, modification of enzymatic functions such as enzyme activity, substrate specificity, and stability. Various technologies such as the mass production technology of enzymes by microorganisms are necessary to\nstudy industrial enzymes. In this lecture, an overview of technologies will be provided, and some examples of the studies will be shown.\n\n","expected_learning":"[TACHIKAWA Hiroyuki]\n- Understanding how organisms form and use membrane structures.\n- Understanding the importance of research using yeast in this field.\n\n[YAOI Katsuro]\n- Understanding the obtaining and analyzing methods of enzymes used in industry\n- Understanding some studies for obtaining and analyzing novel useful microorganisms\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: (A) and (D)\nPlease refer to the curriculum map at the following URL:\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"[TACHIKAWA Hiroyuki] (Date: September 28, 2020)\n1.
