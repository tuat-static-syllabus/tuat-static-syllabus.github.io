For this purpose, it is necessary to understand agricultural production in relation to environmental conditions, agro-ecosystems, and its hierarchical structures at multiple spatio-temporal scales. This lecture aims to provide basic information for the conservation and sustainable management of water environment including rivers, streams and agricultural canals based on some guidelines published by the Japanese government. Advanced techniques for sensing, monitoring and numerical simulations will also be introduced.","expected_learning":"Students are expected to learn:\n-historical development of irrigation and drainage systems and issues in management/planning in near future\n-structure of agricultural and rural environment at multiple scales,\n-guidelines for river works and farmland consolidation for improved agricultural production in harmony with nature, and\n-advanced ecohydraulic monitoring and modelling as well as assessment based on such information.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.
