For example, X-rays are utilized for analysis of the protein structure as well as for the medical diagnosis device. In recent years, measurement techniques in the optical wavelength region such as visible, near infrared and so on are lead to the non-destructive quantitative analyses or molecular imaging. This course provides students with the application techniques using the various electromagnetic waves.\nThe importance of colloid interface science including hydraulics to understand biomasses and natural resources, such as aqueous environment, soil, foods, paper and so on, will be given in accordance with the development of colloid science.","expected_learning":"Lecturer 1\nThis lecture aims for learning of the properties and application of the various electromagnetic waves.\n\nLecturer 2\nThermodynamics and transport phenomenon are essential to understand various physical phenomena observed in biomasses.","course_schedule":"Lecturer 1\n(1) General properties of electromagnetic wave.\n(2) γ-Beam and X-ray : Various applications of high energy electromagnetic wave\n(3) Ultra violet (UV) and visible (VIS) light : Properties of light in daily life.\n(4) Near infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies : Quantitative and qualitative analyses using vibrational spectra.\n(5) Latest technology : Imaging and terahertz (THz) spectroscopy.\n\nLecturer 2\n(1) Colloidal interface phenomena in biomasses\n(2) Brownian motion and diffusion\n(3) Rate of coagulation\n(4) Stability of colloidal systems\n(5) Relationship between polymer adsorption and coagulation of colloid particles\n","prerequisites":"In addition to the 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references.","texts_and_materials":"Nothing specially","assessment":"Lecturer 1; short reports requested in every class (100%).\nLecuurer 2; short reports requasted in every class, however, draging will be based on an examination (100%).","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Spectroscopy, Materials, Optical behavior, Molecular structure","office_hours":"Office hours will be announced in the first class.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"12/26/2019 9:18:56 AM","name":{"id":2214,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅱ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅡ"},"instructor":{"id":1677,"ja":"四方 俊幸, 足立 泰久, 宮澤 光博","en":"SHIKATA Toshiyuki, ADACHI Yasuhisa, MIYAZAWA Mitsuhiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学府","category":"","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":"Nothing specially, however, lectures will introduce you some interesting articles during class."}}
