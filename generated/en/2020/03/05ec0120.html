The lecture by Dr. Tamaoki is focused on the behavior of radionuclide in the environment such as forest and river basin. Also, he lectures the effects of radiation and/or evacuation on wild life and ecosystems taking the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident as an example. The lecture by Dr. Ozaki is focused on environmental pollution by heavy metals and harmful trace elements. Learn the basics of sample collection procedure by practicing a simulated on-site survey in the campus.","expected_learning":"Dr. Tamaoki: To understand the fate of radionuclide in terrestrial area, and impacts of radiation on wild organisms and ecosystems.\n\nDr. Ozaki: To understand actual situation of environmental pollution in the current days and acquire basic procedure of sample collection (e.g. where to collect, how many collect) as an essential step to clarify the situation.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"This class is the omnibus style lecture conducted by the instructors.\nThe detail of the class are shown as follows;\n\nDr. Tamaoki:\n(1) Basic knowledge of radionuclide\n(2) Standard values of radiation based on individual effects\n(3) Environmental fate of radionuclide in Fukushima (1)\n(4) Environmental fate of radionuclide in Fukushima (2)\n(5) Radiation effects on wild organisms (1)\n(6) Radiation effects on wild organisms (2)\n(7) Effects of evacuation on ecosystem\n\nDr. Ozaki:\n(1) Environmental issues: What sort of problem is this?\n(2) Actual situation of harmful trace metal pollution (1)\n(3) Actual situation of harmful trace metal pollution (2)\n(4) Confirm how to collect samples by conventional method\n(5) Understand random sampling procedure and how to collect samples by\nrandom sampling method\n(6) Compare the measure results obtained from the conventional and\nrandom procedures (the previous results are used as example) by\nstatistical software\n(7) How many samples do we need?: Statistical calculation and actual\nimplementation","prerequisites":"This lecture is a specialized subject.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (30 hours).","texts_and_materials":"Dr. Tamaoki: Nothing special\nDr. Ozaki: Nothing special. Print materials are distributed during the lecture.","assessment":"Lecture by Dr. Tamaoki (50%) and Lecture by Dr. Ozaki (50%)\n\nDr. Tamaoki: Evaluate student’s performance by report related to the lecture\nDr. Ozaki: Evaluate student’s attitude in class (70%) and report (30%)","message_from_instructor":"Dr. Tamaoki: Students have to acquire the correct knowledge about the environmental fate of radionuclide and radiation effects on wild organisms through the lecture. Additionally, I hope students will become the source of accurate information on radiation effect and so on.\n\nDr. Ozaki: It is important to understand the on-site condition to tackle environmental issues. I hope students acquire basic skill for understanding actual situations of issues.","course_keywords":"Great East Japan Earthquake, Accident of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, Radionuclide, Environmental fate of radionuclide, Radiation effects on wild organisms and ecosystems, Heavy metal pollution, Random sampling, Statistical comparison","office_hours":"By the demand","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"8/24/2020 1:30:26 PM","name":{"id":2424,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅵ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅥ"},"instructor":{"id":2036,"ja":"大地 まどか, 玉置 雅紀, 尾崎 宏和","en":"OHJI Madoka"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学府","category":"","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":"Dr. Tamaoki: Studies on Radiation Effects from the Fukushima Nuclear Accident on Wild Organisms and Ecosystems.
