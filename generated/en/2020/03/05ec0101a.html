Dielectric relaxation can sensitively detect the presence of dipole moments and their rotation relaxation times. Then, if molecules and functional groups possess dipole moments, the rates of molecular motions for each molecule and group can be determined hierarchically.","expected_learning":"The definition of electric permittivity will be first given, then experimental methods will be explained.
