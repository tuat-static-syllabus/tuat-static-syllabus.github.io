A rapidly emerging, major health concern is the debilitating effect of muscle weakness and atrophy from aging, termed sarcopenia; however, the molecular basis of this condition is not well understood. Our aim, in this course, is to study the current progress in molecular mechanisms of age-related muscle atrophy, find the problems to be solved, and discuss the solutions for the prevention of sarcopenia.","expected_learning":"1) Learn about Sarcopenia.\n2) Consider the impacts of Sarcopenia for our society.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"1) What is muscle function?\n2) How is our motor system maintained?\n3) Muscle atrophy and aging.\n4) The mechanisms of sarcopenia.\n5) What do we need to prevent sarcopenia?\n","prerequisites":"It is preferable for students to prerequisite basic biology, basic biochemistry, basic molecular biology, and basic biophysics.\nIn addition to the lectures in the class, you are recommended to prepare and review the class using the standard amount of time as specified by the university for each class.","texts_and_materials":"N/A","assessment":"Performance in lecture (50% total), examination (50% total)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Sarcopenia, Frailty, Muscle atrophy, Aging, Dementia, Nursing care","office_hours":"e-mail (Kazuhiro Shigemoto : kazushige@tmig.or.jp)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://www.tmig.or.jp/index.html","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/16/2020 4:21:08 PM","name":{"id":2426,"ja":"応用生命化学特論Ⅱ","en":"Special Lecture on Applied Biological Chemistry Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":2045,"ja":"西河 淳, 重本 和宏, 上住 聡芳","en":"NISHIKAWA Atsushi, SHIGEMOTO Kazuhiro, UEZUMI Akiyoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学府","category":"","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":"サルコペニアー概論―がいろん　(監修・荒井秀典　ライフサイエンス出版2017年初版)"}}
