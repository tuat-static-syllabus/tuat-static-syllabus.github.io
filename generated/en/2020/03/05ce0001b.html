After understanding the basics of statistics, simple practical exercises on statistical tests will be given to deepen your understanding of statistical tests.\nThis is a common practicum of the master course.","expected_learning":"You can learn statistical viewpoints by studying and understanding the basics of biological statistics. You can also devise experimental designs and do statistical analysis of research results by understanding statistical analysis methods.\nThe following three points are the reaching criteria.\n1. Understanding the basics of statistics and learning statistical viewpoints.\n2. Understanding various statistical analysis methods and their application on research\n3. Acquiring ability to assess the validity of results obtained by statistical analyses.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"Following contents are included.\n1. Importance of statistical analysis\n2. Difference between population and sample\n3. Difference between standard deviation and standard error\n4.Difference between parametric and non-parametric tests\n5. Parametric test, Student’s t test\n6. Non-parametric test, Wilcoxon test\n7. Parametric test, one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA)\n8. Parametric test, multiple comparison and multiplicity\n9. Parametric test, two-way ANOVA and multiple comparison\n","prerequisites":"Related to subjects of the thesis, it is a required compulsory subject which is divided into special research A group. Subjects of special study group A open for April enrollment students, enrollees for October should take subjects of special study group B.\nPractice and review should be conducted with reference materials and handouts.\n\nIn completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\n","texts_and_materials":"Prepare based on the necessity","assessment":"Participation in class、Performance in lecture (20%), report assignment given by a lecturer (80%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Statistical analysis, Data interpretation, population, sample, mean, standard deviation, standard error, parametric test, nonparametric test, analysis of variance, multiple comparison","office_hours":"By the demand","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"3/3/2020 6:23:45 PM","name":{"id":2155,"ja":"農学実験計画法および統計解析演習Ⅰ","en":"Exercise for Methods of Agricultural Experimental design and Statistical Analysis I"},"instructor":{"id":2023,"ja":"池田 郁男","en":"IKEDA Ikuo"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Prepare based on the necessity"}}
