In recent years, it has become possible to prepare cellulose nanofiber from pulp fiber as the most advanced nanomaterial. In this lecture, students will learn the concept of natural fiber material application through scientific knowledge of pulp fiber and paper. Students will also learn about the properties of nanomaterials derived from natural fibers. This lecture is a specialized subject, and is designed to acquire specialized knowledge on the use of woody biomass in the Functional Control of Natural Resources of this program.","expected_learning":"The learner efficiently can consider how to apply natural fiber to material by learning scientific knowledge about pulp, paper and cellulose nanofiber.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"＃1: Introduction\n＃2: Beating of pulp fiber\n＃3:The third: Structure of paper\n＃4: Physical properties of paper\n＃5: Strength properties of paper-Part 1\n＃6: Strength properties of paper-Part 2\n＃7: Optical properties of paper # 1\n＃8: Optical properties of paper-Part 2\n＃9: Paper layer formation and drying\n＃10: Inter-fiber bonding @ Part 1\n＃11:The eleventh: Inter-fiber bonding II\n# 12: Manufacturing method of cellulose nanofiber\n# 13: Properties of cellulose nanofiber\n# 14: Use of cellulose nanofiber\n# 15: Exam\n","prerequisites":"The learner is interesting in pulp and paper, bio-based material.\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are ecommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Original texts and references provided at each lectures","assessment":"Based on final examination and a mark given for class participation (100%).\n\n\"S\" for extraordinary successful student\n\"A\" for successful student\n\"B\" for student who fully achieved the goal\n\"C\" for student who poorly achieved the goal\n\"D\" for failed student\n","message_from_instructor":"The leaner is desirable to have an opinion about how to use pulp & paper, plant biomass in the future by learning fundamental knowledge of pulp & paper sufficiently.","course_keywords":"pulp, paper, plant biomass","office_hours":"If you have any questions, please contact us after the lecture and send your e-mail to us.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/6/2020 9:16:44 AM","name":{"id":2423,"ja":"資源機能制御学Ⅱ","en":"Functional Control of Natural Resources Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":1836,"ja":"小瀬 亮太","en":"KOSE Ryota"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Mon.2","references":"（１）”The encyclopedia of Cellulose” edited by Cellulose society (In Japanese), “Material science of Cellulose” written by Akira Isogai.\n（２）”Handbook of pulp & paper technology” and “Introduction of manufacturing technology, Vol. 11 in pulp & paper manufacturing technology series” edited by Japan Tappi.\n（３）”Pulp and paper - Chemistry and chemical technology -\" Second and Third Edition edited by James P.
