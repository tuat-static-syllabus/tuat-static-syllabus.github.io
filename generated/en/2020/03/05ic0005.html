They are also requested to prepare reports in English.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"The following lecturers will give each lecture.\n\n1. Tonozuka\nIntroduction to protein structure\n2. Nishikawa\nMechanism of glycosyltransferase\n3. Matsushita\nFundamentals and application will be outlined concerning analysis techniques of nucleic acids and proteins related to the expression of genetic information.\n4. Kawai\nMany genetically modified crops are commercially cultivated. We will learn backgrounds and principles of GMOs and genome edited plants.\n5. Yoshida\nThe primary, secondary and tertiary functions of food are summarized.\n6. Miura\nThe experimental methods to study food functions are introduced.\n7. Yamagata\nKoji-mold is a Japanese \"national fungus\" that has been used for a long time in Japanese brewing and fermentation industry. Koji-mold has played a major role in the formation of Japanese traditional food culture through seasonings such as miso, soy sauce, and vinegar and alcoholic beverages such as sake. In the class, it will be lectured the historical background of utilization of koji-mold, and why koji-mold has been used for the fermentation and brewing in Japan on the basis on the latest molecular biological research results.\n8. Hasumi\nDrug discovery from natural compounds\n9. Suzuki\nIn this lecture, fundamental techniques for cancer diagnosis and latest therapeutic approach for cancer treatment, including pharmacological approach, will be reviewed. Information on ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of anti-cancer drug and a brief history of the discovery of natural compounds for cancer treatment will be provided. At the end of the lecture, our recent research work on cancer stem cells will be introduced.\n10. Kimura\nDietary metabolites and free fatty acids receptors\n11. Sasaki\nThis lecture will provide the review of the molecular mechanisms of infection processes of plant viruses (pathogens), mainly the intercellular movement process via plasmodesmata (cytoplasmic channels connecting adjacent cells), including the recent information on this research field.\n12. Chiba\nPeople have used various compounds produced by animals, plants and microorganisms. The usage is not limited to nutritional sources, but it includes a wide range of medicinal components, preservatives, coloring agents, perfumes, seasonings, etc. Based on their chemical structures and functions, we will consider the role of biological compounds for the future.\n13. Nomura\nCollagen is a main protein in the body. In this lecture, the structure and funtion of collagen is explained\n14. Miyata\nThe effects of food factors on nerve functions are explained.\n15. Hattori\nThe interaction among food componets will be explained.","prerequisites":"This lecture is an elective subject, and is one of the specialized subjects.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (30 hours).","texts_and_materials":"Handouts (paper and/or electronic) will be provided if needed.","assessment":"Report assignment given by each instructor.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Food Science, Microbiology, Organic Chemistry","office_hours":"Questions can be asked after class, or please request an appointment by email.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"English","last_update":"1/25/2020 11:59:04 PM","name":{"id":2194,"ja":"国際応用生命化学Ｉ","en":"International Life and Biological ChemistryⅠ"},"instructor":{"id":1652,"ja":"三浦 豊, 千葉 一裕, 松下 保彦, 佐々木 信光, 好田 正, 野村 義宏, 木村 郁夫, 蓮見 惠司, 鈴木 絵里子","en":"MIURA Yutaka, CHIBA Kazuhiro, MATSUSHITA Yasuhiko, SASAKI Nobumitsu, YOSHIDA Tadashi, NOMURA Yoshihiro, KIMURA Ikuo, HASUMI Keiji, SUZUKI Eriko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Fri.1","references":""}}
