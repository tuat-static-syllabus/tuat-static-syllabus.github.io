The outline of the lecture is as follows.\nLearn and deepen the understanding about environmentally friendly polymers to explore the way for effective use of biomass resources in terms of their social background, chemical structures, properties, synthesis and processing.\nEnvironmentally friendly polymers can be classified into two types. One is biomass plastics produced from biomass, which is a renewable resource, and second is biodegradable plastics, which are degraded by enzymes secreted by microorganisms in the environment. In this lecture, students will learn about the social background, classification, chemical structures, physical properties, and biodegradability of environmentally friendly polymers. In addition, students will deepen their understanding of the synthesis and physical properties of commodity plastics, the basics of recycling, recent researches on the synthesis and materialization of biomass plastics, and the strategy for utilization of biomass resources.\nIt will be updated during the summer vacation.\n\nProf. Tadashi Ohtani of Tokyo Gakugei University. The outline of the lecture is as follows.\nWith the recent demand for a low-carbon society worldwide, in the world of wood use, correct understanding for the use of wood, especially domestic timber, and the treatment for processing wood is an important role. This lecture is aim to deep understanding of the use of wood in a low-carbon society, and discussing the research results of the forefront of wood processing from the viewpoint of processing biological materials. In addition, based on this lecture, as a young researcher (graduate student) in a research organization, the lecture is considered our own research value to induce scientific and technological innovation when engaging in research on environmental resources and material science. Furthermore, based on the current state of innovation research in Japan, the aim is to deepen the understanding of how each research theme contributes to the utilization of environmental resources and material science.\n\n","expected_learning":"You can learn the latest information on Environmental Science and Natural Resources.\n\nThe educational achievement of this lecture is to learn the basics such as social background, types and properties of environmentally friendly polymers.
