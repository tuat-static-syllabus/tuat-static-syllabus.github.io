We will also study about insect defense mechanisms against microorganisms.","expected_learning":"Gene modified food (GMF) is a subject of interdiciplinaly region which is involved in diploma policy of our department. However, to establish own opinion regarding the safety and benefit, students must study basic nowledge on BT insecticidal protein. Consequently,students study molecular biological aspects of BT in insecticidal protein. Also, student study about insect defense mechanism against microoganisms.","course_schedule":"1. Molecular biological aspects of Domain I of Bt insecticidal protein.\n2. Molecular biological aspects of Domain II of Bt insecticidal protein.\n3. Molecular biological aspects of Domain III of Bt insecticidal protein.\n4. Mode of action of Bt insecticidal protein against insect midgut cells.\n5. Microorganisms-recogtion system of the insect immunity.\n6. Role of C-type lectins in a cell immunity, nodule formatin system.\n7. Molecules and mechanism for the nodule formatin.\n8. Final presentation\n\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"No text","assessment":"Result of test which is carried out in every class will be evaluated. Understanding of molecular biological aspects of BT insecticidal protein and basic knowledge of the systems for insect immunity will be appreciated.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"12/27/2019 5:28:32 PM","name":{"id":1545,"ja":"食料安全科学特論II","en":"Safe food production Science II"},"instructor":{"id":892,"ja":"佐藤 令一","en":"SATO Ryoichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","category":"courses for the 5-years doctral program","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Fri.1","references":"Mode of action of Bt: DOI, 10.3390/toxins11020124"}}
