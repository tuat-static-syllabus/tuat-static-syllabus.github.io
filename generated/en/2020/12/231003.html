The contents include mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of polymers which are particularly important for the polymer physics. Goal of this class is to learn skills of fundamentals from the viewpoint of microscopic properties and applications from the viewpoint of macroscopic properties of polymers. This class also focuses on widely professional knowledge obtained from introduction of recent advanced research and actual experimental and samples.","expected_learning":"You can understand mechanical (stress and strain, viscoelastic), thermal (glass transition, relaxation phenomena) and electrical (dielectric, piezoelectric, conducting, ion-conductive) properties of polymeric materials.","course_schedule":"Part 0: Class guidance\nPart 1: Fundamentals of polymer science (molecular weight and dispersion of polymers)\nPart 2: Mechanical properties of polymer (strain and stress, viscoelastic properties of polymers)\nPart 3: Mechanical properties of polymer (elasticity of rubbers, non-linear phenomenon of viscoelastic materials)\nPart 4: Thermal properties of polymer (Measurement of thermal properties of polymers)\nPart 5: Thermal properties of polymer (Glass transition, crystallization and melting of polymers)\nPart 6: Electrical properties of polymer (Dielectric, piezoelectric and conductive properties of polymers)\nPart 7: Final examination","prerequisites":"Physical chemistry (please note that you cannot take this lecture if you have already taken Polymer Chemistry and Polymer Physics.)","texts_and_materials":"Printed papers are distributed in the class and unnecessary to buy textbooks","assessment":"The grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, reports, and online tests. Standard study time set by our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows: Approximately 20% on report papers, 30% on attendances and 50% on the online examination. Grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Polymer science, Stress and strain, Viscoelastic, Glass transition, Relaxation, Dielectric, piezoelectric and conductive","office_hours":"Anytime in the first floor of Room 121 of Building No. 4","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/27/2020 10:37:47 AM","name":{"id":1534,"ja":"物質エネルギー設計特論I","en":"Advanced Energy and Materials Design I"},"instructor":{"id":600,"ja":"富永 洋一","en":"TOMINAGA Yoichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":2,"min":1,"max":2},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","category":"courses for the 5-years doctral program","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Fri.2","references":"Refer to the books on polymers in the library"}}
