In this course, we learn about the Newton’s law and it's applications, such as the falling motion of one particle and oscillatory motion of pendulums. Then, we also learn the “system of particles” such as rotational motion of rigid bodies.","expected_learning":"1. Be able to explain the Newton’s law and to apply the law to projectile motion and oscillatory motion of particles\n2. Be able to explain kinetic energy, potential, and relation between angular momentum and torque\n3. Be able to calculate the motion of center of mass and relative motions of two interacting particles\n4. Be able to solve problems about motion of rigid bodies.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"L 1 Concept and Terminology in Mechanics, Coordinate System, Vector, Position, Velocity, and Acceleration\nL 2 Newton’s law, Projectile Motion，Simple Harmonic Motion\nL 3 Damped Oscillations, Driven Oscillations\nL 4 Work and Kinetic Energy\nL 5 Conservation Forces and Potential Energy\nL 6 Angular Momentum and Torque\nL 7 2D Motion, Polar coordinates\nL 8 Gravitational Force, Motion of Planets\nL 9 Summary and Midterm Exam\nL10 System of two particles，Center of Mass\nL11 Motion of Center of Mass, Relative Motion\nL12 Motion of Rigid Bodies，Angular Momentum and Energy of Rigid Bodies\nL13 Momentum of Inertia\nL14 Rotation of Rigid Bodies with an Axis, 2D Motion of Rigid Bodies\nL15 Summary and Final Exam\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"\"Mechanics -Insights into the Laws and Theorems-” in Japanese by M.
