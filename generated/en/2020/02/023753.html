In this lecture, students will learn techniques for creating and understanding drawings in electrical and electronic engineering with practical skills. This lecture is positioned as a specialized subject in the department of electrical and electronic engineering, and learns more specialized things in electrical and electronic engineering. In making drawings, the intentions of the drawing must be completely communicated. The drawing user must be able to easily get it. In this lecture, you will learn the technology for creating drawings specified by the JIS standard. In this lecture, you will learn drawing creation technology using drafters.","expected_learning":"The aim is to learn basic drawing techniques in electrical and electronic engineering. The aim is to learn the basic usage of drafters in drafting. The above leads to the acquisition of basic technologies of electrical and electronic engineering as shown in viewpoint (B) in the diploma policy of the department of electrical and electronic engineering　course.","course_schedule":"In this lecture, the following contents are explained.\n# 1: Guidance\n#2-3: Usage of drafters and exercises\n#4-6: Projections used in drafting and exercises\n#7-9: Letters and lines used in drafting and exercises\n#10-11: Symbols used in drafting and exercises\n#12-13: Practical drafting in electrical and electrics and exercises\n#14: Summary\n#15: Confirmation of understanding\n\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"The same printed matter will be given in the class.","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Drafting, Drawing, Electrical and electronic engineering, CAD, Projection, JIS","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/10/2020 11:23:32 AM","name":{"id":2120,"ja":"電気電子製図","en":"Electrical and Electronics Drawing"},"instructor":{"id":2001,"ja":"髙根沢 真, 有馬 卓司","en":"TAKANEZAWA Makoto, ARIMA Takuji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
