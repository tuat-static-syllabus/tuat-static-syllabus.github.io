Students will especially learn the concept of equilibrium through this course. Much emphasis will be put on the improvements of students’ English skills as well. For example, vocabulary tests will be conducted at the beginning of each lecture. Additionally, several workshops are scheduled to deepen understandings of the concept of each chapter through the exercises in the textbook.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"Week 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Lecture (chapter 4)\nPhysical Transformation of Pure Substances I：Phase diagram of pure substance\nWeek 3: Lecture (chapter 4)\nPhysical Transformation of Pure Substances II：Thermodynamic aspects of phase transition\nWeek 4: Exercises (chapter 4)\nWeek 5: Chapter 4 Summary\nExamines (chapter 4)\nWeek 6: Lecture (chapter 5)\nSimple Mixture I：Thermodynamic description of the mixture & Solution properties\nWeek 7: Lecture (chapter 5)\nSimple Mixture II：Phase diagram of binary system & Phase diagram of three-component system\nWeek 8: Lecture (chapter 5)\nSimple Mixture III：Activity & Activity of ion\nWeek 9: Exercises (chapter 5-1)\nWeek 10: Exercises　(chapter 5-2)\nWeek 11: Chapter 5 Summary\nExamines (chapter 5)\nWeek 12: Lecture (chapter 6)\nChemical Equilibrium I：Equilibrium constant & Reaction conditions and chemical equilibrium\nWeek 13: Lecture (chapter 6)\nChemical Equilibrium II：Electrochemical cell & Electrode potential\nWeek 14: Exercises (chapter 6)\nWeek 15: Chapter 6 Summary\nExamines (chapter 6)\n","prerequisites":"Students are strongly recommended to take Physical Chemistry I in advance.","texts_and_materials":"Atkins' Physical Chemistry\nOxford University Press\n","assessment":"Total evaluation of mini examinations (including vocabulary tests) (approx. 10%), exercises (workshop) (approx. 20%) and full examinations (approx. 70%).\n\n[Past performance distribution]\n2017　S:2%,A:28%,B:24%,C:28%,D:20%\n2018　S:0%,A:6%,B:35%,C:29%,D:31%\n2019　S:0%,A:9%,B:32%,C:28%,D:32%","message_from_instructor":"Attendance at every lecture, preparations, and reviews are recommended.","course_keywords":"Thermodynamics, chemical equilibrium,","office_hours":"After finishing lecture ~ 17:00","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/28/2020 11:50:00 AM","name":{"id":606,"ja":"物理化学Ⅱ","en":"Physical Chemistry Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":591,"ja":"直井 勝彦","en":"NAOI Katsuhiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Thu.3","references":""}}
