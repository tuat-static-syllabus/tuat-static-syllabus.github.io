Electricity generation in our country now relies to a major fraction on thermal power stations, but in order to restrict consumption of fossil fuels and to suppress global warming effects, we need our effort to shift to renewable energies and construct a sustainable society. In the first half of the semester, the lecture deals with various types of energy sources, discussing their characteristics and problems from the point of view of physics and chemistry as well as energy engineering and economics. The latter half of the semester will be devoted to the nuclear energy and radiation. Lectures will be given on various aspects of radiation: the basic physical properties, its detection, biological and medical effects and radioactive contamination of the environment. All these knowledges will be required of the students in order for them to have their own opinion about the usage of nuclear energy. This lecture course deals with an interdisciplinary subject related to applied physics, and gives students a unique opportunity of learning introductory nuclear and particle physics, which are otherwise not taught in this university.\nThe lecture will be given by the part-time lecturer TORII Hiroyuki A.","expected_learning":"To acquire knowledge on energy usage, a topic indispensable in our contemporary society, and be educated enough to consider the energy problems from various points of view.\n(1) To understand merits and problems for each of various types of energies including renewable energies.\n(2) To understand radiation and nuclear energy from physical, bio-medical, environmental and other points of view.\n(3) To understand relevance of energy sources and energy engineering to various fields of physics and chemistry, such as mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, semiconductor physics, chemical reaction, radiation and radioactivity, nuclear physics etc. To understand various forms of energy and consider effective usage of energy from engineering point of view.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"1.
