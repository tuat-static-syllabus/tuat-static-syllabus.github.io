Purpose: As a general review of the Organic Chemistry Series Lecture for Organic Materials Chemistry Science Department students, exercises related to reactions were conducted, and in addition to the ability to interpret organic reactions, structural characteristics, chemical properties, physical properties Aiming to train forecasting ability and evaluation ability on We aim to acquire a bird's eye view of organic chemistry through arrangement of common points and differences between molecular orbital legal thinking and organic electronic theory thinking. It also plans to combine the purpose as a remedial of students who could not necessarily achieve results in learning organic chemistry.\nb. Outline: Mainly on the reactive aspects of organic chemistry, reorganizing the guiding principle and fundamental principle and its confirmation through exercises. We exercise mainly on reactions of carbonyl compounds ・ carboxylic acid derivatives and reactions of aromatic compounds, while interlacing the comparison between quantum chemical and organic electronist thinking. The problem is basically based on the Bolhart Shoa Contemporary Organic Chemistry, 4th edition (mainly the second volume), which is the relevant textbook of organic materials, but in principle the explanation in class will be done without using textbooks etc.","expected_learning":"【Arrival target of class】\nThink about where reactions are likely to occur in the molecule, what kind of reaction form is assumed, draw reaction mechanisms on your own, and give power to capture organic reactions in a bird's-eye view.","course_schedule":"Nucleophilic addition reaction to the first carbonyl compound (1)\nClassification of carbonyl compounds\n・ Nucleophilic addition reaction to aldehydes and ketones\n・ Acetal formation reaction\n・ Cyanohydrin formation reaction\nNucleophilic addition reaction to the second carbonyl compound (2)\n・ Reaction with carbon nucleophiles\nAcetilide ion, Grignard reagent, hydride reagent (first half)\nNucleophilic addition reaction to the 3 rd carbonyl compound (3)\n・ Reaction accompanied by migration of hydride reagent (latter half) and hydride equivalent\nComprehensive problem\nNucleophilic substitution reaction to the 4th carboxylic acid derivative (1)\nClassification of carboxylic acid derivatives\n・ Reaction of acid chloride with nucleophilic reagent\n・ Hydride reduction of ester compounds, reaction with Grignard reagent, hydrolysis\nNucleophilic substitution reaction to the 5th carboxylic acid derivative (2)\n・ Functional group conversion reaction of carboxy group\nAcid chloride, ester synthesis, acid anhydride synthesis\nReaction in which the C?O bond of the 6th carbonyl compound is replaced by C?N bond\n・ Imine, oxime, hydrazone, semicarbazone formation reaction\n・ Reaction to replace carbonyl group with methylene\n7th Replacement reaction of α-hydrogen of carbonyl group (1)\nCarboanion, tautomerism, enolization\n・ Halogenation, ketone haloform reaction\n8th substitution reaction of α-hydrogen of carbonyl group (2)\n・ Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction\n・ Reformatsky reaction\nReaction involving substitution of α-hydrogen of the 9th carbonyl group and nucleophilic addition / substitution to the carbonyl group (1)\nThe reaction involving the substitution of the α-hydrogen of the carbonyl group and the nucleophilic addition / substitution to the carbonyl group (2)\nThe reaction involving substitution of α-hydrogen of the 11th carbonyl group and nucleophilic addition / substitution to the carbonyl group (3)\nThe reaction involving substitution of α-hydrogen of the carbonyl group and nucleophilic addition / substitution to the carbonyl group (4)\nResponse planned to be handled in 9th to 12th:\nAldol reaction, Claisen condensation, condensation of carbonyl compound of acid and basic catalyst, cross-condensation,\nMannich reaction, Perkin condensation, Knoevenagel reaction, Michael addition, Dieckmann condensation, reaction of nitroalkane or nitrile as a carbonyl compound equivalent, Robinson ring formation reaction\n13th Reaction of Aromatic Compound (1)\nElectrophilic aromatic substitution reaction\n14th Reaction of Aromatic Compound (2)\nNucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction\nIt may be possible to re-learn a unit that is lacking in the 15th general exercise\nThe 16th final exam","prerequisites":"It is desirable that you take classes of organic chemistry related subjects (Organic Chemistry 1 to 4, Exercise 1 Biomaterial Chemistry, Equipment Analysis, etc.) within the subjects to be taught in the Department of Organic and Polymer Materials Chemistry, but you have acquired credits Is not a condition\n","texts_and_materials":"Although it is not planned to use a specific book as a textbook,\nSome of the tasks to be used specify (by number) the problem of Vollhardt Shore's Modern Organic Chemistry 6th Edition (mainly the second volume, chemist)","assessment":"Evaluate by final exam. Perform small tests or exercises as much as possible each time. The results of the quiz will not be reflected in the results unless there are special circumstances to consider. Depending on the understanding degree of the students, intermediate tests may be conducted.","message_from_instructor":"Organic chemistry is not a subject of memorization.\nI would like you to develop a bird's-eye view of the organic chemistry system within the scope you have taken, along with a total review of the organic chemistry subjects of the department of organic chemistry. I would like you to confirm with your own head and hand that the system of organic chemistry can be explained by comparatively few basic principles and guiding principles.\nI would like you to actively participate in students who can not accept the achievement of organic chemistry and students who have a sense of stagnation in learning organic chemistry.","course_keywords":"Organic chemistry, organic reaction, substitution, addition, elimination, radical reaction, ion reaction, molecular structure, molecular orbital method, covalent bond","office_hours":"12 o'clock of the lecture start date about 1 hour at 13 o'clock; when asking questions etc. at other time zones, it is necessary to make appointment (telephone, e-mail only when not connected) before coming to the room I recommend (in principle, attendance at class)","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"12/20/2019 4:39:10 PM","name":{"id":757,"ja":"有機化学演習Ⅱ","en":"Exercises in Organic ChemistryⅡ"},"instructor":{"id":1992,"ja":"岡本 昭子, 米澤 宣行","en":"OKAMOTO Akiko, YONEZAWA Noriyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Fri.2","references":"(1) Organic Reaction Theory, Kanji Kano, Sankyo Publishing; ISBN 978-4-7827-0525-4 C3043, B5-266\n(2) Organic electronic theory explanation [4th edition] Foundations of organic chemistry, Minoru Imoto, Tokyo Kagaku Dojin; ISBN 9784807903382, page 408"}}
