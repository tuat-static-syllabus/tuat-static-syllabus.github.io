Particularly, we study the heat equations and wave equations (in a sense of classics). In order to calculate the solutions of the equations, we also study the Fourier series and Fourier transformations.","expected_learning":"In this class, we will obtain the abilities bellow:\n1. You can calculate the Fourie series expansion of some simple or easy functions.\n2. You can calculate the solutions of the heat/wave equations with some initial value, or boundary conditions.\n3. You can prove some propositions about the heat/wave equations.","course_schedule":"We will study as follows.\n\n1: Guidance, the solutions of 1st order PDEs of dimension 2, with constant coefficients.\n2: Separation of values method of the heat equation and the Fourie series.\n3: Dirichlet kernel, a convergence of the Fourier series expansion.\n4: The explicit representation of the solution of a heat equation with initial value and boundary conditions.\n5: The Max value principle of heat equations and the uniqueness of the solutions.\n6: The heat equation of infinite interval, and the Fourier transformations.\n7: The heat kernel and the integral representation of the solution of a heat equation.\n8: The 1-dimensional wave equation and its d’Alembert solution.\n9: The solutions of the wave equations with fixed end/open end.\n10: The transformation of the independent variable of 3-dimensional wave equation.\n11: Spherical mean method and the solution with a integral representation.\n12: The projection of the solution of 3-dimension to the plane.\n13: The domain of influence.\n14: The energy conservation low of wave equations and its uniqueness.\n15: Examination, review.\n\nThe examination contains problems about the 1-dimmensional equations and Fourier series expansions only. You can write in English or in Japanese.\n","prerequisites":"I will talk in this class with an assumption that you already know the calculus of differential/integral analysis, the linear algebra, and the ordinary differential equations.","texts_and_materials":"Textbook:\nPartial Differential Equation (Butsuri-Suugaku course) SHIBUYA Senkichi, UCHIDA Fuichi, Shokabo\n(in Japanese)\n\nWe use this book as a textbook, but I don’t talk just like written in this book.
