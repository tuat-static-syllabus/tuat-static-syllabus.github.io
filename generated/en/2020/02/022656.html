The information theory provides fundamental principles that are necessary to build communication systems; eg. how to store data efficiently or how to send data reliably. In this course, starting with basic methods of coding, we will learn theorems that provides the fundamental limit of communication systems.","expected_learning":"Students are expected to learn coding, information, coding theorems.\n\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"(1) Introduction\n(2) Error detecting code\n(3) Error correcting code 1\n(4) Error correcting code 2\n(5) Data compression 1\n(6) Data compression 2\n(7) Midterm exam\n(8) Review until midterm\n(9) information measure and data compression\n(10) Source coding theorem (Shannon's first theorem)\n(11) Channel coding and channel capacity\n(12) Channel coding theorem (Shannon's second theorem)\n(13) Proof ideas of channel coding theorem\n(14) Codes attaining the channel capacity\n(15) Final exam","prerequisites":"This course is a basic class, and it will be a basis for more advanced courses.\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Some materials will be provided in the class.","assessment":"Midterm exam 50%, Final exam 50%","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Tue: 10am-12pm","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/18/2020 2:10:16 PM","name":{"id":698,"ja":"情報理論","en":"Information Theory"},"instructor":{"id":1986,"ja":"渡辺 峻, 中山 悠","en":"WATANABE Shun, NAKAYAMA Yu"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Fri.4","references":"Stefan M.
