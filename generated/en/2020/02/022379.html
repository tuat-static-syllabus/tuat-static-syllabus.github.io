In this lecture, considering historical transformation of concept of chemical bonding and quantum chemical viewpoints, explanations for \"chemical bond\" are given.\nIn this course, lectures are given using Microsoft PowerPoint. In each lecture, handouts are distributed.\n","expected_learning":"1. To understand narrowly defined chemical bonds and intermolecular interactions, and thus to explain properties and structures of substances.\n2. To understand widely defined chemical bonds using molecular orbital theory.\n3. To understand electronic states of substances using molecular orbital theory.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"1st lecture: Structures and properties of atoms. (Chapter 1)\n2nd lecture: Atomic orbital and electron configuration. (Chapter 2)\n3rd lecture: Molecular orbital and covalent bonds. (Chapters 3)\n4th lecture: Diatomic molecules and dipole moment.

Standard study time set by the our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is indicated in the first lecture.","message_from_instructor":"Since it is necessary to understand \"chemical bond\" from the viewpoint of new concepts such as wave function, students should review what they already learned about \"chemical bond\". Since the related contents with other lecture subjects will be pointed out, the uncomprehended contents should be checked.","course_keywords":"Chemical bond, Quantum theory, Molecular structure, Molecular orbital theory, Covalent bond, Metallic bond, Cooridinated bond, Hydrogen bond, van der Waals bond","office_hours":"Whenever I am in my office, I take questions.","remarks_1":"Grade points distribution before last year: nothing.","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://web.tuat.ac.jp/~akio-sai/index.html","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/22/2020 4:41:27 PM","name":{"id":526,"ja":"化学結合論","en":"Introduction to Chemical Bonding"},"instructor":{"id":479,"ja":"齊藤 亜紀夫","en":"SAITO Akio"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Fri.3","references":"\"The basics of modern materials chemistry-Approach by chemical bond theory\" edited by Keiichiro Ogawa and Norimichi Kojima (Kodansha).
