Standard study time set by the our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows: Exercises: 40%, Midterm report: 30%, and Final report: 30%.\nGrade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive\nevaluation:\nS: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.\n","message_from_instructor":"To understand natural science, Calculus is a very important basic study.
