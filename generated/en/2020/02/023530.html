It is designed for junior (third year) undergraduate students. This course helps students understanding essential technical background for micro / nanofabrication. Moreover, principles in MEMS devices and phenomena upon with microchips will be introduced by instructors. In addition, through this course, students can learn how to understand principles and phenomena, and build a strong knowledge base. The course is divided into two halves. The first half of the term will be taught by Prof. Ando and focus on an introduction to silicon-based MEMS. The second half of the term will be taught by Prof. Iwami and applications and case studies of MEMS devices to various fields will be introduced.\nThis course is an elective subjects in the curriculum of the M2 Course of the MSE department.","expected_learning":"The standards of this lecture are :\nto understand a basic MEMS technology.\nto understand characteristics of various microfabrication technologies.\nto understand the principles of representative actuators and transducers.\nto understand physics in micro/nanoscale that is applicable in MEMS.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Lec # Lecture Topics Sub Topics\nPart I: Silicon-based MEMS\n1 Guidance\n2 Introduction to MEMS: MEMS and micromachine\n3 Outline of MEMS fabrication: Dry and wet etching\n4 Actuators: electrostatic, piezoelectric and electromagnetic actuators\n5 Microcantilever & SPM: AFM, STM\n6 Examples of MEMS devices for measurements: 3D microstage, lateral force sensor\n7 Micro/nano tribology: Issues in lubrication for MEMS\nPart II: Applications and Case studies\n8 Lithography and beam applications: Electron beam lithography and focused ion beam\n9 Case study :MEMS accelerometer 1) Principle and implementation\n10 Case study :MEMS accelerometer 2) Analysis of actuators, springs, and capacitive readouts based on virtual displacement method\n11 Case study :MEMS accelerometer 3) Mechanical and electrical sensitivity, and its improvement methods\n12 Case study :Mirror devices 1) Principle and applications\n13 Case study :Mirror devices 2) Torsion bars and scanning angles\n14 MEMS applications: What is the key to commercialization?\n15 Revision\nFinal Exam","prerequisites":"This is part of the M2 Course, and its completion is recommended for students in the Department of Mechanical Systems Engineering.\n\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts.\n","texts_and_materials":"PDFs are distributed via Moodle.","assessment":"Drill & Quiz: 60%\nFinal Exam: 40%\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Tue 10:00-17:00","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/31/2020 3:50:31 PM","name":{"id":799,"ja":"ＭＥＭＳ","en":"MEMS Technology"},"instructor":{"id":1998,"ja":"岩見 健太郎, 安藤 泰久","en":"IWAMI Kentaro, ANDO Yasuhisa"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Tue.4","references":""}}
