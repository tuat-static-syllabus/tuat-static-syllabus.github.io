This course deals with crystal structures of inorganic solids, which are important to understand physical properties of inorganic solids, and explain various physical and chemical properties of inorganic solids based on concrete examples of representative materials.","expected_learning":"The standard of the course is to understand crystal structures of representative inorganic solids and fundamental physical and chemical properties of inorganic solids mainly based on their crystal and defect structures.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Course guidance\nFundamentals of crystal structure 1 (close packing structures, symmetry, unit cell) - Chapter 1\nWeek 2: Fundamentals of crystal structure 2 (types of crystals, crystal structure, use of crystal structure visualization softwares) - Chapter 1\nWeek 3: Representative crystal structures 1 (AB type and AB2 type structures) - Chap. 1\nWeek 4: Representative crystal structures 2 (structures of important oxides) - Chap. 1\nWeek 5: Imperfect structures (defects, amorphous solids)- Chap. 2\nWeek 6: Electronic structures (molecular orbital theory, band theory) - Chap. 3\nWeek 7: Electric properties 1 (electronic conductivity, superconductivity) - Chap. 4\nWeek 8: Electric properties 2 (ionic conductivity) - Chap. 4\nWeek 9: Electric properties 3 (electronic properties) - Chap. 5\nWeek 10: Magnetic properties 1 (behavior of materials in magnetic field) - Chap. 6\nWeek 11: Magnetic properties 2 (representative magnetic materials and their crystal structures) - Chap. 6\nWeek 12: Optical properties 1 refraction, (reflection, absorption and emission of light, phosphors) - Chap. 7\nWeek 13: Optical properties 2 (laser, other optical properties) - Chap. 7\nWeek 14: Properties of low-dimensional materials and nanomaterials (intercalation, surface properties) - Chap. 10, 14 & handout\nWeek 15: Summary of the course\nTerm-end exam","prerequisites":"Students entering this class are desired to have learned Inorganic Chemistry I & II, Physical Chemistry III or their equivalents. Furthermore, fundamental understanding of Electromagnetics are also preferable. Use of internet and moodle is necessary in order to display crystal structures using a computer software.\n\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for\nand review the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and\nusing the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"村石治人　基礎固体化学（三共出版）ISBN 4-7827-0417-8\n(H.

Meanwhile, it is known that inorganic solids, even very fundamental materials such as silica and alumina, often have various different structures, resulting in considerably different physical properties. Even the same crystal structures may show different physical properties resulting from their defect structure and nanostructure. This course starts from understanding crystal structures of inorganic solids and afterward presents factors governing various physical and chemical properties of inorganic solids.","course_keywords":"inorganic materials, crystal structure, physical and chemical properties of solids","office_hours":"Prof. Kazuyuki Maeda (Building 1: N413) Anytime","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"See Moodle page of this course (in Japanese)","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/8/2020 7:59:45 PM","name":{"id":738,"ja":"物性化学","en":"Materials Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":485,"ja":"前田 和之","en":"MAEDA Kazuyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"金1","references":"A.
