The contents also include topics concerning main group elements in inorganic chemistry and inorganic materials.","expected_learning":"The standard of the course is to understand periodic properties of the elements and fundamental features of the typical elements and representative compounds of them based on the groups in the periodic table.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Introduction, Periodic properties of the elements\nWeek 2: Acids and bases\nWeek 3: Oxidation and reduction\nWeek 4: Hydrogen\nWeek 5: The Group 1 elements\nWeek 6: The Group 2 elements\nWeek 7: The Group 13 elements\nWeek 8: The Group 14 elements\nWeek 9: Usage of main group elements and topics (1)\nWeek 10: The Group 15 elements\nWeek 11: The Group 16 elements\nWeek 12: The Group 17 elements\nWeek 13: The Group 18 elements\nWeek 14: Usage of main group elements and topics (2)\nWeek 15: Term-end summary\nTerm-end exam","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and review the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Specific textbooks are not used, but the course will basically follow the two references listed bellow. Lecture handouts are distributed if necessary.","assessment":"Class performance (5%), quizzes & reports (65%), and the term-end on-line exam (30%) are totally evaluated.","message_from_instructor":"Chemistry of the main group elements tends to go into detail, since these elements often show very different properties according to the groups and rows in the periodic table. Understanding unique properties of each element based on the periodic table and the electron configurations can lead to development of new materials and finding of novel physical properties. Voluntary efforts to survey literatures on elements and compounds that interest you are desired for further understanding.","course_keywords":"Periodic law of elements, Periodic table, Main group elements","office_hours":"Prof. Kazuyuki Maeda (Building 1: N413) Anytime","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/11/2020 11:58:19 AM","name":{"id":605,"ja":"無機化学Ⅱ","en":"Inorganic Chemistry Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":485,"ja":"前田 和之","en":"MAEDA Kazuyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Thu.4","references":"Basic Inorganic Chemistry, 3rd Edition (Cotton/Wilkinson/Gauss)\nInorganic Chemistry, 6th Edition (Shriver/Weller/Overton/Armstrong/Rourke)"}}
