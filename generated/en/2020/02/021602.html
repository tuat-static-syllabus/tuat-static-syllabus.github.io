Scientists and engineers must know how to model the world in terms of differential equations, and how to solve those equations and interpret the solutions. This course focuses on linear differential equations and their applications in science and engineering.","expected_learning":"After completing this course the students should be able to:\n1. Write the differential equations of engineering systems including required initial conditions.\n2. Understand practically where initial conditions come from and how to evaluate them.\n3. Become familiar with linear or nonlinear,constant parameter or time varying parameter, as applied to differential equations and systems.\n4. Model multiple input-multiple output engineering system by a system of differential equations.\n5. Solve a first order differential equation.\n6. Solve an n-th order linear differential equations with constant coefficients.\n7. Solve differential equations using power series solution.\n8. Solve engineering problems described by a differential equation or systems of differential equations.\n9. Understand the fundamental difference between ordinary and partial differential equations from physical point of view. Solve simple partial differential equation problems.","course_schedule":"We will follow the textbook and aim to cover in full or in part the following chapters:\n[1] First Order Differential Equations\n[2] Second Order Linear Equations\n[3] Higher Order Linear Equations\n[4] Series Solutions of Second Order Linear Equations\n[5] Systems of First Order Linear Equations\n[6] Nonlinear Differential Equations and Stability\n[7] Partial Differential Equations\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"T.
