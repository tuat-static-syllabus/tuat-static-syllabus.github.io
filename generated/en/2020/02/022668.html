We are going to study current, magnetic field / vector magnetic potential by current including their relationship, and steady magnetic field. Then we are going to study time-varying field (electromagnetic induction and displacement current), and electromagnetic waves. Finally, Maxwell’s equations are derived. Practices are included for better understanding.","expected_learning":"You will be able to understand steady magnetic field in Electromagnetism. Then, you will be able to calculate the magnetic field and vector magnetic potential by current, and understand the fundamental principle of steady magnetic field. You will be able to understand time-varying field (electromagnetic induction and displacement current), and physical meaning of Maxwell’s equations after studying electromagnetism.","course_schedule":"1st.: Background of Electromagnetism and introduction.\n2nd: Review of vector analysis, Ohm’s law, and current / electric field in conductors.\n3rd: Current and magnetic field\n4th: Ampere’s force and magnetic flux density\n5th: Lorentz force and tube.\n6th: Practice 1\n7th: Biot-Savart’s law\n8th: Practice 2\n9th: Vector magnetic potential\n10th: Practice 3\n11th: Gauss’ law\n12th: Ampere’s circuital law in derivative formula\n13th: Ampere’s circuital law in integral formula\n14th: Practice 4\n15th: Force on currents in magnetic field Review\nExamination\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"The Feynman Lecture on Physics, by Feynman, Richard Phillips\nEngineering Electromagnetics, William H.
