But even the best technology is of no value if it cannot be connected to a business, in other words, if it cannot lead to innovation. The priority is first to understand what the market wants, and then develop great technology which both responds to those needs and outdoes the competition. Another role of technology is to give birth to as yet unformed markets. Technology one develops turns into a business only when it takes shape and is launched effectively into the market. It is this series of initiatives that constitute technology management - management designed to innovate.\nThis course is designed for beginners, the intent being to provide an overview of the nature of technology management in manufacturing companies, as well as learning the concepts and methodologies of technology management via lectures and group exercises. The syllabus is as follows.\n1. What does it mean to stimulate innovation based on technology (connect technology to business)?\n2. Corporate vision, and the way of approaching and proceeding with developing business strategy\n3. Leveraging logic models to express strategy\n4. Program management\n5. Organizational management and communication\n6. Exercises in researching companies and presentations by groups\n\nThis course is offered as one of the courses in the Global Integrated Studies, and is taught by a professor with real-world experience.
