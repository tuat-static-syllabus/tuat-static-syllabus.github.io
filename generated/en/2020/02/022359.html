The purpose of this lecture is to understand a biochemistry from the basics to the practical use. For example, \"eating three times a day\", \"eating twice a day\", and \"eating nothing\", ...which would be an efficient way to decrease body weight? This can be easily understood by learning the contents of the 11th lecture concerning a basic metabolism.","expected_learning":"To acquire knowledge of biochemistry that is useful in polymer and medicine fields.\n\nFor the curriculum policy perspective of this course, please refer to the curriculum map in the Faculty of Engineering Course Guide.","course_schedule":"(1) Introduction to biochemistry\n(2) The structure and function of small molecules\n(3) The structure and function of macromolecules (proteins)\n(4) The structure and function of macromolecules (enzymess)\n(5) The structure and function of macromolecules 1 (DNA and RNA)\n(6) The structure and function of macromolecules 2 (DNA and RNA)\n(7) Biomacromolecules in medical fields\n(8) Review\nand midterm examination\n(9) The structure and function of lipids\n(10) The structure and function of polysaccharides\n(11) Metabolism\n(12) Cell 1\n(13) Cell 2\n(14) Cell 3\n(15) Review\nand final examination","prerequisites":"In addition to the class hours, please prepare and review according to the standard time presented by the university.","texts_and_materials":"Not specified (I would like to make a lecture in which each student understands and summarizes the written and oral explanations in this lecture to be a textbook on biochemistry for everyone).","assessment":"Midterm examination: 50%\nFinal examination: 50%\n<Evaluation standard>\nIn order to evaluate the degree of achievement of the goal (\"Expected Learning\" mentioned above), a wide range of problems from basic questions to description problems are used in examinations.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"biochemistry, medicine","office_hours":"Any time is available.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://web.tuat.ac.jp/~murakami/","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/4/2020 3:57:40 PM","name":{"id":2369,"ja":"生体材料化学Ⅰ","en":"Biomaterials ChemistryⅠ"},"instructor":{"id":607,"ja":"村上 義彦","en":"MURAKAMI Yoshihiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"木2","references":"Not specified (I think that any commercially available book concerning general biochemistry will be a reference book for this lecture)."}}
