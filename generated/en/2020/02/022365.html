In this lecture, you will learn the basic principle of quantum mechanics as well as the fundamental about the quantum theory of translation, vibration, and rotation of molecules. Then you can understand the nature of quantum chemistry and spectroscopic principles of atoms and molecules. Therefore, this lecture is the basis of the contents of \"Quantum chemistry II\" and \"Structural chemistry\".","expected_learning":"(1) Understanding the difference of physical description in classical mechanics and quantum mechanics.\n(2) Understanding of the wavefunction, Hamilton operator, and Schroedinger equation.\n(3) Calculating the Schroedinger equation in simple cases and finding the corresponding wavefunction and energy level.\n(4) Understanding of the quantization of the translational, vibrational and rotational energies.\n","course_schedule":"1.
