Each student is required to calculate a plenty of exercises by his or her hand in order to deepen the understanding and the way of thinking of statistical thermodynamics. This class is also to learn the basic mathematical techniques of statistical physics for solving the typical exercises and also for application to actual physics.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"Week 1 Probability and multiplicity\nWeek 2 Multiplicity function, average and sharpness and mean of the multiplicity function\nWeek 3 Entropy and the temperature\nWeek 4 Boltzmann factor\nWeek 5 Partition function and Hermholtz free energy\nWeek 6 Calculation using partition function, pressure\nWeek 7 Thermodynamic identity\nWeek 8 Classical statistical mechanics, equipartition law of energy\nWeek 9 Thermal radiation and Planck distribution\nWeek 10 Specific heat and the Debye theory for lattice vibration\nWeek 11 Chemical potential\nWeek 12 Gibbs factor and Gibbs sum\nWeek 13 Fermi-Dirac distribution and Bose-Einstein distribution\nWeek 14 Ideal gas and indistinguishability for identical particles\nWeek 15 Heat and work\nThere are possibilities that the schedule may change more or less due to the progress of the lecture.","prerequisites":"Mechanics I, II, Electromagnetics I, II, Introduction to quantum mechanics, Quantum mechanics I, Mathematical Physics I, II","texts_and_materials":"Charles Kittel, “Thermal Physics” (W.
