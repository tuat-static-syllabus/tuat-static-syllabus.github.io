Furthermore, it is important to set goals with a clear view of targets that have economically and socially high-impact.\nSome guest lecturers will join to this course from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), a core organization that promotes science and technology policy in Japan. In this course, we (mainly beginners in this field) will learn the following contents, especially about the flow from basic research result to societal implementation, through classroom lectures, case studies, and group exercises.\n1. Basic research on agriculture and engineering and its fusion research\n2. Industry-academia collaboration and social implementation\n3. STI for SDGs\n4. STI for creating a future society\n5. Group discussion and presentation of issues\n6. Conclusion\n\nThis course is offered as one of the courses in the Global Integrated Studies, and the lecturer of this course has first-handed experiences on the establishment of new business fields by industry-academia collaboration at companies, the promotion of basic research at JST and the promotion of advanced industry-academia collaboration at TUAT. In addition, JST-based guest lecturers will also participate in the lectures to provide some knowledge on current domestic and overseas trends.\n","expected_learning":"1) To be able to understand the concept and role of the SDGs in society, and to propose some ideas for practicing basic research and industry-academia collaboration that image the future society.\n2) To learn how to lead effective conclusions by thinking, speaking, and discussing independently within the group.\nCompetency development:\nIndependently thinking, Self motivation, Leadership, Adjusting skill, Communication, Writing skill, Presentation skill, Subject researching and solving skill.\n","course_schedule":"1st day:\n♯1　Guidance of basic research and industry-academia collaboration: Explain how to proceed with the entire lecture and how to evaluate it.\n♯2 Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) for the SDGs: The guest lecturers from JST will discuss some issues related to science, technology and innovation for the SDGs, such as explanations of terms, trends in domestic and overseas efforts, social implementation through industry-academia collaboration, and the ripple effects of social returns on results.\n♯3 Group Activities 1: Preparation of report on science, technology and innovation for the SDGs. In addition, the groups consisting of about five students will survey on the “TUAT Plastic Reduction 5R Campus” activity declaration from the viewpoint of science, technology and innovation for the SDGs.\n\n2nd day\n♯4 Science and technology for creating a future society (JST-Mirai Program): Invited JST -Mirai Program staff gives lecture on the innovation and society creation aimed at the future society creation including businesses, methods and initiatives to quickly return the basic research results in university to society.\n♯5 Group Activities 2： Preparation of report and presentation on the concept used in the JST-Mirai Program. The groups consisting of about five students will choose a specific theme such as key elemental technologies, technologies required for industry-academia collaboration, and their industrial fields. The description about the relationship with the SDGs is also required.\n♯6 Group presentation 1： Among the issues adopted by the JST-Mirai Program, future perspectives about one theme should be presented. Representatives will report some contents such as the research on important elemental technologies for realizing the future, technologies required for industry-academia collaboration, their industrial fields, and the perspective of the SDGs.\n\n3rd day\n♯7 Group presentation 2： Regarding to the declaration of activities for the “TUAT Plastic Reduction 5R Campus”. Presentations will be conducted by each group regarding the specific contents of this project and contributions to society.\n♯8 Conclusion : The significance of industry-academia collaboration to return the latest research results at universities and other institutions to society as quickly as possible is introduced using actual examples.\n","prerequisites":"In group exercises, individual roles are assigned by each group. Investigation is required about the content of the issue at the relevant site of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). Preparation of a report on the lecture content by the guest lecturers.\nThe contents of the selected issues should be summarized and presented in a group.\nPreliminary survey related to the SDGs and the JST-Mirai Program is required about 8 hours of extra-class study time each.\nIn addition to 16 hours in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\n","texts_and_materials":"Dedicated material will be distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"Class contribution (every class), 30%: participation to the class discussion and contribution.\nMini-report , 30%: richness of reports\nGroup work (3.5.6.7 class), 40%: contribution to the group discussion and quality of the group.\n","message_from_instructor":"The integrated research of agriculture and engineering is a feature of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. The results will be implemented in society through industry-academia collaboration.\nIn this course, learn the importance of the viewpoint of “Sustainable development goals” during the flow from basic research to industrial activities. In addition, understand the future society that achieved them, and understand cutting-edge approaches such as setting and solving science and technology issues to achieve them. We hope that this lecture provide useful knowledge and experience, such as studying specialized fields and setting research themes, and as a working adult.\n","course_keywords":"Science and technology, Agriculture-industry integration, Basic research, Industry-academia collaboration, Innovation, Social implementation, SDGs, Future society, Global society, Open innovation","office_hours":"After each lecture, or send e-mail to me h.wake@w7.dion,ne,jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/28/2020 6:20:17 PM","name":{"id":2417,"ja":"工学部特別講義Ⅱ（産学連携科目〜農工融合〜）","en":"Special Lecture on EngineeringⅡ(Industry-Academia Collaborative Class : Fusion of \"Agriculture\" and \"Engineering\")"},"instructor":{"id":2007,"ja":"和気 仁志","en":"WAKE Hitoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"2nd","course_type":"2nd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Related sites of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)\nSDGｓ：\nhttps://www.jst.go.jp/sdgs/\nhttps://www.jst.go.jp/global/sdgs.html\nJST-Mirai Program（未来社会創造事業）：\nhttps://www.jst.go.jp/mirai/jp/about/index.html\n"}}
