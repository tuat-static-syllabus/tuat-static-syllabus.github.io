The students will be evaluated by their understanding of the research background, performance presentation and capability to answer the questions scientifically.\nNakamura and Ichikawa Laboratory: The students should make a brief introduction of the most recent paper on 1) the development and evaluation of media for the electrochemical devices, 2) the state analysis of the biopolymer in media, and 3) the improvement or development of analytical tools on interfacial reaction.\nNagasawa and Tera Laboratory: The students will introduce two papers from J. Am. Chem. Soc., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., ChemBioChem, etc. per week, and discuss the contents of the papers. The students will also read the reference books related to organic synthesis, such as Classics in Total Synthesis, in turn by answering questions scientifically.\nSakurai Laboratory: The students will learn to read and discuss the English scientific papers in the field of organic synthesis of derivatives of biological molecules and chemical biology.\nYohda, Shinohara and Noguchi Laboratory: The students will learn to read and understand the English scientific papers related to the cutting-edge researches on biotechnology. The students will be trained to obtain the English ability and knowledge on biotechnology.\nNakamura, Kim and Nakamura Laboratory: The students will participate in two types of lab activities. The one is the weekly data discussion which is focusing on their research progress. The students in certain group will present their recent data every two weeks. The other lab activity is the seminar which will be carried out at the same time with the data discussion. The students will introduce the most recent research paper closely related to their research themes.","prerequisites":"The student must be the member of corresponding laboratory.","texts_and_materials":"Follow the instructions of your supervisor.","assessment":"Class Participation　100％\n(The students will be evaluated by the attendance, presentation and performance on discussion.)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/23/2020 9:09:58 AM","name":{"id":861,"ja":"応用生物工学演習Ⅰ","en":"Seminar for Biotechnology Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":681,"ja":"浅野 竜太郎","en":"ASANO Ryutaro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":10,"min":4,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"卒研・卒論","references":"Follow the instructions of your supervisor."}}
