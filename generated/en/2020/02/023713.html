The nature of this subject was said to be the most important task of power companies around the world, on energy and demand forecasting. In this lecture all practical experiences including break-through-finding are taken into examples and practices and taught in the classroom. These kinds of actual practices are not mentioned in any textbooks, so the students are eagerly benefited from this session.","expected_learning":"By attending this course, you will be able to learn about the Power Systems and also able to analyze the Network calculation, and Day-to-Day Operation Planning which is generally done by power companies every day.","course_schedule":"The energy network which plays an important role in supplying good quality of power (stable and reliable) is regarded as a large-scale system which consists of power generation transmission, substations and distribution equipment. In this course we study and consider problems in entire of this large-scale network.\nOur aim is to understand the basic characteristics and structure of an energy network, and study the planning and operation and control of this huge systems.\nThis course consists of the following contents.\n\n(1) Planning and operation of energy network\n(2) Energy network elements and structure\n(3) Characteristics and features of energy network\n(4) Mathematical model of energy network\n(5) Outline of network planning, operation, and control\n(6) Economy load dispatching of power generation equipments,\n(7) Active power and frequency control\n(8) Voltage and reactive power control\n(9) Network security and reliability analysis\n(10) Energy load forecasting and supply-demand balance planning\n(11) Power deregulation\n(12) Wind power energy\n(13) Application of intelligent methods (such as artificial neural netwoks) in energy network\n(14) Distributed energy resources and micro grid\n(15) Energies and environment harmony","prerequisites":"I want you to study some reference books about the optimization techniques and renewable energy resources.","texts_and_materials":"I don't use a textbook for this course.\nI will distribute some documents related to the course before the classes or I will put them on the homepage of my laboratory, so you can download them any time through the internet.","assessment":"【Important, Due to Corona Virus Situation】　In case we had the entire classes of this course as ONLINE Lecture】\nThe method of evaluation\n10 marks:　report\n30 marks: intermediate test\n60 marks: final examination","message_from_instructor":"I welcome any students from different departments.\nPlease prepare well before class and during class please keep calm.","course_keywords":"Social development and energy, an environmental problem, power generation technology, deregulation of power industry, energy demand forecasting","office_hours":"Any time during the weekdays (you need to make appointment first)","remarks_1":"【Important, Due to Corona Virus Situation】　In case we had the entire classes of this course as ONLINE Lecture】\nThe grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, report, and online tests. Standard study time set by our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows:\nAttendance: 20 points\nquizzes and assignment test: 40 points\nonline test: 40 points\nTotal points: 100 points\nPassing Score: 60 points and above\nGrade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.\n","remarks_2":"In this course the main subjects are power system and renewable energy which are the hot topics now. It is only this course that teaches deregulation of power industry to the BS students.","related_url":"www.tuat.ac.jp/~bahman","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/7/2020 2:10:18 PM","name":{"id":825,"ja":"エネルギーネットワーク工学","en":"Energy Network Engineering"},"instructor":{"id":555,"ja":"長坂 研","en":"NAGASAKA Ken"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"Nagasaka","day_period":"Thu.4","references":"(1) Book name: \"Planning and operation of electric power system\"\nPublisher: Ohm-Sha\nAuthor: Yasuo Tamura\n(2) Book name: \"electric power system engineering\"\nPublisher: Denki Shoin\nAuthor: Yasuji Sekine"}}
