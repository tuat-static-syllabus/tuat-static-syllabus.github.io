The winners of Nobel prize in chemistry in 2013 are working on this field. Today people think that chemistry is not only discussed from experiments but also theoretical simulations. In this lecture, I introduce quantum mechanics, an important rule for small particles and also basics in theoretical chemistry. We will consider how the quantum mechanics is used for chemical problems. Major discussions in chemistry are based on molecular electronic states. We will solve the Schrodinger equation for the electrons in atoms or molecules by hand or using a computer, which will help you to understand the theoretical chemistry world more deeply. I expect learners already have enough knowledge for classical mechanics in high school.\n","expected_learning":"Learners will understand the following points.\n(1) roles of theoretical chemistry\n(2) basic knowledge of quantum mechanics\n(3) electronic structure of atoms\n(4) electronic structure of molecules\n","course_schedule":"In the beginning of each lecture, you have a small examination and you need to study beforehand every week. The problems and answers are opened in the internet.\n\n1st week: Introduction: Chemistry is mathematics!\n2nd week: Review of classic mechanics in high school (equation of motion, circular motion)\n1st week: Bohr model, partial derivative\n2nd week: wave equation, nature of light and electron\n3rd week: Derivation of Schrodinger equation, nature of wave function\n4th week: one-dimensional square well potential problem\n5th week: two and three-dimensional square well potential problem\n6th week: Schrodinger equation of Hydrogen atom\n7th week: Schrodinger equation of Hydrogen atom, mathematical software\n8th week: Multi-electronic atoms, electron configuration, spin\n9th week:H2+ molecule, Linear combination of atomic orbital (LCAO)\n10th week: Molecular orbital and chemical reaction\n\n","prerequisites":"Students attending this course are expected to have enough knowledge of physics (especially classical mechanics and wave function) at high-school level.\n","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Attitudes and mini-examinations, and three reports. Late-coming more than 15 minutes equals to an absence of the class. You will fail to get your credit with more than twice absences of the classes.\n\n","message_from_instructor":"I will do my best and make this course enjoyable and memorable for you. You can enjoy studying theoretical chemistry by getting over various mathematics and physics problems and computational simulations!","course_keywords":"Computational chemistry, quantum mechanics, atom, molecule, electronic structure","office_hours":"8th building ,room 571, Tokyo Metropolitan University, 1-1, Minami-Osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/minoria/qc/qc_first.html","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/24/2020 12:17:35 PM","name":{"id":508,"ja":"化学基礎","en":"Basic Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":561,"ja":"阿部 穣里","en":"ABE Minori"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"工学府","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"水2","references":"Japanese text written by Nakata Munetaka “Kiso Course Butsuri Kagaku I Ryoshi Kagaku”\nPhysical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach by McQuarrie and Simon, University Science Books; 1 edition (July 1, 1997) etc\n"}}
