This experiment consists of two parts, “Physical Chemistry Experiment” and “Inorganic Chemistry and Analytical Chemistry”. The class is divided into two classes, C1 and C2, and one class conducts physical chemistry experiments followed by inorganic chemistry and analytical chemistry experiments. The other class conducts physical chemistry experiments after conducting inorganic chemistry and analytical chemistry experiments first.\n\nIn “Physical Chemistry Experiments”, students learn physical chemistry experiments through thermodynamic physical quantity measurement experiments and understand the correspondence between experiments and theories. Learn how to handle data and organize appropriate charts to organize experimental results.\n\nIn “Inorganic Chemistry and Analytical Chemistry Experiments”, familiarize yourself with experimental operations and instrument handling through analytical experiments centered on titration, and learn safe and careful basic experimental techniques to obtain accurate measurement results, as well as errors and effectiveness. Become familiar with the correct handling of numbers. Also, exercises using molecular models for spectrophotometric analysis and isomers of inorganic complexes.\n","expected_learning":"In “Physical Chemistry Experiments”, students can understand that the concepts, such as enthalpy, entropy, and chemical potential, and learn thermodynamic physical quantity measurement methods.\n\nIn “Inorganic Chemistry and Analytical Chemistry Experiments, especially through chemical analysis and material synthesis, students can acquire the basic experimental techniques by ensuring the knowledge learned in the lectures on inorganic and analytical chemistry.\n\nDiploma policy perspective of this course: Please refer to the curriculum map in the course guide.","course_schedule":"The following themes will be implemented in Experiments in Applied Chemistry I. There are also group themes, so please check the schedule and meeting place in the overall guidance (the date: specified later, belongings: 2020 version of student experiment textbook, and pens).\n\nPhysical chemistry experiment\n1. Experiment Guidance: Explanation of physical chemistry experiments, confirmation of precautions in conducting experiments, safety training.\n2. Measurement of reaction heat: Learn the concepts of enthalpy and reaction heat through the reaction between hydrochloric acid and magnesium. Also, learn how to measure the heat of reaction using the volume change caused by the melting of ice.\n3. Cryoscopic determination of molecular weight:\nDetermination of molecular weight by measuring the lowering of the\nfreezing point of a sucrose/water solution. Understanding the\nthermodynamic theory of the freezing and the method of least squares.. Also, learn about the least squares method.\n4. Partial molar volume: Confirm by the experiment that 20 ml of liquid A and 80 ml of liquid B are not necessarily 100 ml, and consider the reason using the concept of chemical potential.\n5. Solubility of solids: Understand the thermodynamic concept of dissolution and observe temperature-dependent solubility changes. The solubility is grasped from the concentration measurement by ultraviolet light absorption spectroscopy (UV).\n6. Rubber elasticity / rheology: Understand that rubber elasticity is entropy elasticity. Students learn the concept of rheology in the association with various everyday phenomena.\n7. Electrical conductivity of electrolyte solution: Learn the difference in concentration dependence of electrical conductivity of strong and weak electrolyte solutions.\n\nInorganic and analytical chemistry experiments\n1. Experiment Guidance: Explain the contents of inorganic / analytical chemistry experiments, confirm precautions in conducting experiments, and conduct safety lectures.\n2. Statistical processing practice: Learn about experimental data processing methods by actually measuring particle size distribution.\n3. Practice of molecular model: Understand the three-dimensional structure of metal complex with molecular models.\n4. Neutralization titration: A typical example of volumetric analysis is neutralization titration using acid-base reaction. Master the preparation of secondary standard solutions and titration with acid-base indicators. Moreover, neutralization titration is performed using a glass electrode pH meter to prepare a pH titration curve. Learn the equivalence point of the neutralization reaction from the titration curve, and learn about the shape of the titration curve, the strength of the acid, and the operating principle of glass electrodes.\n5. Complex titration: Evaluate EDTA solution with zinc standard solution, learn about complexation reaction and metal indicator, and learn the theory and experimental operation about complex titration method. In addition, the determination of calcium and magnesium contained in limestone is carried out using this.\n6. Spectrophotometric analysis: Conduct an adsorption experiment of methylene blue with zeolite to deepen understanding of the adsorption evaluation method by spectroscopy.\n7. Powder X-ray diffraction: Identification of the sample and information on the crystal structure can be obtained by irradiating the crystalline material with X-rays and measuring the intensity of the diffracted X-ray. Identify unknown samples by powder diffractometry and deepen understanding of crystal structure evaluation methods.\n","prerequisites":"Preparatory training is essential from the viewpoint of ensuring safety in conducting practical training. Each person should carefully read the experimental texts and fully understand the contents, create a flowchart of the experimental procedure, etc., examine the physical and chemical properties of the reagents in advance, and write them in the experimental notebook (15 hours).\nAfter the experiment is completed, an experiment report is created. Appropriately describe the purpose, experimental procedures, results, discussions, conclusions and references according to the prescribed format, and submit them within the prescribed date (30 hours).\nAdd 90 hours of class time and the above-mentioned learning outside the class, and prepare and review. The contents of the study is in accordance with the standard number of hours of the University.\n\n","texts_and_materials":"Use the Department of Applied Chemistry experiment text (2020 edition).","assessment":"Comprehensive evaluation of report points (including test points) (50%) and normal points (including class participation and positive presenting during experiments) (50%). Guidance, lectures, and experiments should be all attended in principle. Acquiring credits may be difficult due to lateness, absence without notice, delayed or unsubmitted reports, and negligence during the experiments.","message_from_instructor":"Safety in experiments takes priority over anything else. Carefully prepare for the experiment, and dress appropriately.","course_keywords":"Physical Chemistry, Thermodynamics, Inorganic Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry","office_hours":"Respond as needed. Please refer to the guidance materials for contact information.","remarks_1":"1) Report deadline: 8:40 on the designated date as a general rule\n2) Attendance will be taken at 13:00 at all laboratory classes.","remarks_2":"1) All students are required to join the disaster and accident insurance for students (GAKKENSAI).\n2) Comply with safety rules (wearing an approved lab coat, closed-toe sports shoes, safety protective glasses, name tags, etc.). Details will be explained in the guidance.","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"12/11/2019 7:00:54 PM","name":{"id":2375,"ja":"応用化学実験Ⅰ","en":"Experiments in Applied ChemistryⅠ"},"instructor":{"id":1978,"ja":"沖田 尚久, 森 啓二","en":"OKITA Naohisa, MORI Keiji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Mon.3～5,Tue.3～5","references":"P.
