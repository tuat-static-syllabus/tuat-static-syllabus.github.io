In this course, students will learn theoretical background, then will execute molecular orbital calculations using a molecular orbital analysis software. The purpose is to learn a method for interpretation of computational results.\nThis is a course held by a part-time instructor. This syllabus is subject to change by the faculty member due to lectures.\n","expected_learning":"(1) Students should understand the Schrodinger equation, electronic structures of atoms and diatomic molecules, orbital-orbital interaction, and approximation theory (variational method, Huckel method, Hartree-Fock method, etc.).\n(2) Students will be able to perform molecular orbital calculations of small molecules.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: (B)\n","course_schedule":"1) Schrodinger equation\n2) Atomic orbitals of hydrogen-like atoms (1)\n3) Atomic orbitals of hydrogen-like atoms (2)\n4) Atomic orbitals of hydrogen-like atoms (3)\n5) Visualization of atomic orbitals using a software\n6) One-center two-electron systems and variational method\n7) Multi-electron atom, Pauli exclusion principle and Hund's rule\n8) Molecular orbital and Slater determinant\n9) Orbital-orbital interaction, Huckel method, Bonding and antibonding orbital\n10) Introduction of molecular orbital analysis software\n11) Homonulcear diatomic molecules\n12) Heteronuclear diatomic molecules\n13) Polyatomic molecules\n14) Molecular orbital calculation and visualization of molecular orbitals using a software\n15) All topics in this course may be covered.\n　　Final examination","prerequisites":"Related subjects: Mathematics subjects, mechanics, vibration and wave physics, electromagnetics, inorganic chemistry I, computer chemistry\nIn addition to the 30 hours of class time and the time required to create assignments, refer to the distributed lecture documents and reference books, and prepare and review according to the standard hours of the University.","texts_and_materials":"No text is specified.
