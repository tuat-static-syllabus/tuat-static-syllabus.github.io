Programming is basic skill for today's researchers and engineers. In this lecture, students learn C language which is generally used for computer simulations and controls of experimental systems. Recently, Python language is rapidly becoming very popular because it is used as the standard language for AI programming. This lecture also teaches Python language.","expected_learning":"Students should be able to make fundamental programs by their own.\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1. C: Preparation of programming environment\n2. C: Computer hardware, data, variable, equation\n3. C: Process flow (1)\n4. C: Process flow (2)\n5. C: Functions and program structure\n6. C: Pointer and array\n7. C: String manipulation\n8. C: File input and output\n9. Python: Preparation of programming environment, interpreter and complier, object-oriented programming\n10. Python: Variable, equation\n11. Python: Process flow\n12. Python: Collection\n13. Python: Functions and program structure\n14. Python: Libraries (Numpy, Matplotlib)\n15.
