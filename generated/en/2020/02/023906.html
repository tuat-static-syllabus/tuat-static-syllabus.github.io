The lectures also include examples of how basic studies are fundamental to and applied to the cutting-edge research, and of the research environment in the globalized society. Through such experience, students are encouraged to consider the values of their studies and research in a broad context and towards their own future. This course will aid students to elevate their global awareness and improve their English communication skills in practice.\n\nThis lecture course is included in Global Integrated Studies of the Liberal Arts and Fundamental Studies, and offers students opportunities to apply and integrate their knowledge and skills obtained in the foundation courses during their first two years in the university.\n","expected_learning":"1.

I feel lucky it is true for me, but I don't think most people can say the same yet. Human-Robot Interaction studies show that the readiness of the systems is far from reaching expectations. To compensate for the robots’ limitations tricks are used: controlled lab experiments, Wizard of Oz, and minutely scenarized interactions. Studies controlling some very specific parameters are like in-vitro experiments, failing in providing a holistic study of human and robot shared experience. \"HRI in the wild\", in ecological environment, can provide a rich data set of interactions, they are like in-vivo experiments. Because of the unstructured nature of the experience, programming such interactions is ultimately time consuming and requires multiple expertise, thus often left behind. I will present our tools to create HRI in the wild and some applications in kindergarten and private houses. I will introduce our robot cognitive processes and expressive movements generation. I will conclude with some robot & UX design perspectives.\n\n\n\"Physics and Chemistry of Particles in Air\" by Prof Lenggoro\n\nThe physical and chemical properties of airborne (gas-phase) particles effect the？air quality (indoor or outdoor). It’s important to understand how the airborne particles (for example: air pollution) form and the role they play in the Earth's climate through their interactions with clouds. It is also crucial to understand the chemical reactions leading to production of the \"good\" particle. The range of nanophase-materials generated by these gas-routes has increased in recent years to include many metals and various oxide ceramics.","prerequisites":"In addition to 16 hours in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"・Class participation (30%)： Contribution to the discussion and lectures throughout\n・Written report (60%)：　For each GIR session, a report is assessed, which should include summary and important points of the lectures and discussion, as well as own thoughts and ideas about international research environment and career paths\n・Contribution to Group activity（10%）：Contribution and presentation during the common sessions\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"International research development, Career paths","office_hours":"For the international GIR researchers, questions should be asked during the class time.
