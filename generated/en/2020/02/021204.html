These lectures are intended to prepare students for other courses in biology offered by this department. In biological systems, there are different hierarchies of scale: from tiny molecules to small cells and to tissues and organs. Observing organisms at these different scales forms the basis of biology. In this course, the goal is to capture a comprehensive picture of biology through photographs, illustrations, and movies that can help explain each level of the hierarchy.","expected_learning":"You will gain an understanding of the basics of cell biology, genetics, and molecular biology and will be able to explain the details of the course content summarized below.","course_schedule":"Lecture 1: Introduction: Cell structure and function [You are responsible to check your fundamental knowledge of biology. Course instructors will explain the structure and function of cells as the basic unit of life. We will also explain the structure and function of biological membranes.]\n\nLecture 2: Energy and enzymes [Instructors will explain energy conversion in chemical reactions required for life and the role of enzymes as catalysts.]\n\nLecture 3: Metabolic pathways [Instructors will explain how cells use metabolism to produce energy required to maintain living systems. We will cover the metabolism of four types of molecules: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.]\n\nLecture 4: Photosynthesis [Instructors will explain how plants convert light energy into chemical energy.]\n\nLecture 5: Cell division [Instructors will explain somatic cell division, which is used to create genetically identical cells, and meiosis, which is the foundation of genetic diversity.]\n\nLecture 6: Genetics [Instructors will provide an overview of Mendelian genetics and explain its relationship with chromosomal movement during cell division.]\n\nLecture 7: Structure and function of DNA [Instructors will explain the structure of DNA, which is the essence of genetic information, and the DNA replication process. Students will also learn how amino acids correspond to nucleotide sequences.]\n\nLecture 8: Viruses and bacteria [Instructors will explain how viruses and bacteria grow.]\n\nLecture 9: Eukaryotic gene expression [Instructors will describe how gene expression is regulated in eukaryotes, with inclusion of common organisms, such as plants and animals.]\n\nLecture 10: Animal responses [Instructors will explain how animals respond to external stimuli. We discuss vision and hearing.]\n\nLecture 11: Cellular information transmission [Instructors will explain how cells within the body transmit signals in response to environmental stimuli.]\n\nLecture 12: Immunity [Instructors will explain how immunity protects our bodies from outside invaders.]\n\nLecture 13: Development and evolution [Instructors will explain the process of forming an individual from a fertilized egg and discuss the relationship between development and evolution.]\n\nLecture 14: Biotechnology [Instructors will explain recombinant DNA technology and related biotechnologies.]\n\nLecture 15: Summary, general exercises [The whole set of lectures will be summarized and the level of comprehension will be measured.]","prerequisites":"Review homework will be distributed for each lecture. At the beginning of the next lecture, we shall check the student’s comprehension level by giving a quiz related to the previous lecture. Course instructors will provide slide materials for the next lecture so that students can prepare ahead of time.","texts_and_materials":"Life: The Science of Biology\nDavid Sadava, David Hillis, H Heller","assessment":"A review test of the previous lecture will be conducted at the beginning of each lecture.\nOne mid-term and one final exam will be conducted.\nTotal value of quizzes, 60%; mid-term exam, 20%; final-term exam, 20%.","message_from_instructor":"I would like you to understand that the basic method of science is in experimental observation, and not simply memorizing knowledge.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Contact via email.
