Prof. Iwabuchi is also involved in assessments such as risk communication and river management with high metal concentration around the suspended mine, and requests lectures from the viewpoint of practitioners. Learn the concepts and basics of human health risk assessment and ecological risk assessment of chemical substances, and introduce case studies and practice calculations. Not only one-way “lectures” but also opportunities for students to present and discuss with their own heads. In addition, 2 to 3 external speakers will be invited to provide related topics.\n\n","expected_learning":"(1) Understand the human health and ecological risk assessment and management practices of chemical substances\n(2) To acquire a trial and error method to understand daily risks","course_schedule":"1. Introduction\n2. What is risk assessment? -Try to “stretch” until safety and security\n3. Procedure for human health risk assessment\n4. Example of human health risk: calculating radiation risk\n5. External speaker (planned: Risk of radioactive materials)\n6. Examples of human health risks: Risks calculated by everyone (planned: group announcement)\n7. Human health risk assessment: other examples and summary\n8. Ecological risk assessment Before that!\n9. Ecological risk assessment basics and procedures\n10. Basis of statistical analysis for ecological risk assessment: eh? How do you decide no influence?\n11. Decide the water quality environmental standard for zinc\n12. Zinc regulation and its problems: how to infer real-world effects?\n13. External speaker (planned: Risk of genetically modified plants)\n14. Introduction of lecturers or ecological risk related cases\n15. Summary","prerequisites":"It is preferable to have high school level mathematical skills (just a little), but we welcome those who are willing to participate in the lecture actively even if there are three spaces, and have the willingness to learn using their own heads.","texts_and_materials":"Materials necessary for the lecture will be distributed every time. Also, the slides used for the lecture will be available via Moodle after the lecture.","assessment":"Regular points, submissions and final exams.\n\n","message_from_instructor":"I hope that you will learn the trial and error method to read and understand everyday \"risks\" through learning about risk assessment and management of chemical substances. If you're confident, come to the world of risk assessment research.","course_keywords":"Environmental risk assessment, ecological risk assessment, water quality environmental standards, cancer risk","office_hours":"No office hours because this class has operated by a part-time lecturelar.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/21/2020 5:58:11 PM","name":{"id":612,"ja":"環境物質化学概論","en":"Environmental Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":595,"ja":"岩﨑 雄一","en":"IWASAKI Yuuichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Wed.4","references":"Junko Nakanishi \"Environmental Risk\" Iwanami Shoten (1995)\nKazuya Nakatani “Risk Monosashi: Is there a safe and secure life?” Japan Broadcasting Publishing Association (2006)\nChikako Hatakeyama “Really thinking about food safety” Chemistry Doujin (2009)\nNakanishi Junko, Masunaga Shigeki, Matsuda Hiroyuki \"Environmental Risk Calculation\" Iwanami Shoten (2003)\nHiroyuki Matsuda \"Introduction to Ecological Risk Studies\" Kyoritsu Publishing (2008)"}}
