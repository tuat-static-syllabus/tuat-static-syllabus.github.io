For example, power in various kinds of electrical and electronic devices is different, which can be divided to direct current and alternating current in quality, or can be divided to big power and small power in energy. Power electronics is the necessary technique of supplying power for electrical and electronic devices. Power electronics is a significant subject of the power control and transformation for various the electrical and electronic devices.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to figure out principles about technique of power control and power transformation.","course_schedule":"Week 1 Introduction to power electronics.\nWeek 2 The relevant knowledge of semiconductor devices used power control and transformation.\nObjectives: Principles, structure and function.\nWeek 3 Circuit configuration.\nObjectives: Understand the concept of rectifying circuit changing alternating current into direct current (1)\nWeek 4 Operating principles.\nObjectives: Understand the concept of rectifying circuit changing alternating current into direct current (2)\nWeek 5 Circuit configuration.\nObjectives: Separate excitation devices of changing direct current to alternating current (1)\nWeek 6 Operating principles.\nObjectives: Separate excitation devices of changing direct current to alternating current (2)\nWeek 7 Circuit configuration.\nObjectives: Self-excitation devices(1)\nWeek 8 Operating principles.\nObjectives: Self-excitation devices (2)\nWeek 9 Control circuit.\nObjectives: Amplification of PWM (1)\nWeek 10 Operating principles.\nObjectives: Amplification of PWM (2)\nWeek 11 Circuit configuration.\nObjectives: Transformation of AC-AC (1)\nWeek 12 Operating principles.\nObjectives: Transformation of AC-AC (2)\nWeek 13 Circuit configuration.\nObjectives: Transformation of DC-DC (1)\nWeek 14 Operating principles.\nObjectives: Transformation of DC-DC (2)\nWeek 15 Summarization\nObjectives: Prepare for the exam.\n","prerequisites":"Students entering this class are assumed to have the knowledge of electronic devices and electronic circuit.","texts_and_materials":"Power electronics by Masao Yano & Ryohei Utida","assessment":"Participation:10%, Report: 30%, Test: 30%, Final Exam: 30%\nThe grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, report, and online tests.
