Fluid flow, electric field, and magnetic field are all represented as a spatial distribution of vectors in a three-dimensional space. Vector analysis is a field of mathematics concerned with various operations to the vectors, which includes differentiation and integration of vectors. In this course, students will learn the basic points in vector analysis that are required to learn fluid dynamics and electromagnetism. Students will be trained to solve various problems in vector analysis by doing exercises.\n\nThe topics covered in the course include:\n- Inner and outer products\n- Frenet-Serret formulas\n- Gradient, divergence, and rotation of vector fields\n- Line and surface integrals\n\nThis course is one of the specialized fundamental courses in the curriculum.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n- Calculate the curvature and torsion of a trajectory by differentiation of a vector function\n- Calculate the area of a curved surface by integration of a vector function\n- Calculate the gradient, divergence, and rotation of vector fields\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Unit vector, base vectors, linear independence of vectors\nWeek 3: Dot product, direction cosines\nWeek 4: Vector equations, outer product\nWeek 5: Triple product, differentiation of a vector function of one variable\nWeek 6: Integration of a vector function of one variable, arc length, unit tangent vector, normal vector\nWeek 7: Curvature, binormal vector, torsion, Frenet?Serret formulas, Kepler’s laws\nWeek 8: Review of the first half, midterm exam\nWeek 9: Vector function of two variables, first fundamental quantities, surface element\nWeek 10: Scalar and vector fields, gradient, Hamilton operator\nWeek 11: Directional derivative, divergence\nWeek 12: Rotation, line integrals of a scalar field\nWeek 13: Line integrals of a vector field, surface integrals of a scalar field, surface integrals of a vector field\nWeek 14: Divergence theorem, Stokes’ theorem, cylindrical and polar coordinate systems\nWeek 15: Review of the second half, exam\n","prerequisites":"Basic calculus and algebra courses.
