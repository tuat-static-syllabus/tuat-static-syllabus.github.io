In this course, we will introduce another programming model, functional programming, using the Haskell language. While imperative programming is based on the state of a program, functional programming is based on the evaluation of functions. This different computational approach, or paradigm, has many advantages and applications. Also, it has been gaining more and more attention from software engineers as it enables high-level object manipulation and easy program logic description. One could speak of modern programming. The second half of this course will be dedicated to logical programming, using the Prolog language for concrete examples. The relation and transition between the two paradigms (i.e., functional and logical) will be at the centre of discussions.","expected_learning":"Being able to understand what functional and logic programming are and how to use the Haskell and Prolog programming languages to produce short programs.
