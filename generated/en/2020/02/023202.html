He is the faculty member in charge is a professor for many years in the Faculty of Engineering at Hosei University, and has long been contributing to research and education in polymer chemistry, and has a reputation for teaching polymer chemistry in an easy-to-understand way to even beginners. In this lecture, we will study polymer synthesis centered on addition polymerization and condensation polymerization. In addition, the contents of the course may be changed due to class organization.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n(1) Recognize the fundamentals of polymerization reactions\n(2) Determine the appropriate polymerization in order to obtain target polymers\n(3) Describe the living polymerization system with giving a specific example\n","course_schedule":"Week1: Introduction to polymer chemistry\nWeek2: Definition of polymer\nWeek3: Kinetics of condensation polymerization\nWeek4: Condensation polymerization\nWeek5: Basic strategy of addition polymerization\nWeek6: Examination\nWeek7: Radical polymerization\nWeek8: Radical copolymerization\nWeek9: Structure and reactivity of vinyl monomers\nWeek10: Ionic polymerization\nWeek11: Anionic polymerization\nWeek12: Cationic polymerization\nWeek13: Living polymerization\nWeek14: Ring-opening polymerization\nWeek15: Examination\n","prerequisites":"Understanding the contents of the scope of Organic Chemistry I-III.","texts_and_materials":"Polymer synthesis chemistry (revised edition), Inoue Shohei, Shokabo, 2011","assessment":"Mid-term test (40%), final exam (60%)\n2017 results distribution: S: 24%, A: 39%, B: 17%, C: 17%, D: 2%","message_from_instructor":"In a high molecular compound, several hundreds to several thousand molecules of monomers to be repeating units must be linked.
