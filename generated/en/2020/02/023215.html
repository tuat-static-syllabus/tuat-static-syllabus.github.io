The aim of this course is to improve reading comprehension ability of English scientific articles related to applied chemistry and materials and presentation skills, it is required every time to make a presentation of the contents understood from an English article as an assignment.\nIt should be noted that students are divided into a small groups with 5 - 7 members and attend a lecture by a different teaching stuff every week. Students must receive an article two weeks before each lecture and prepare to give a full presentation.
