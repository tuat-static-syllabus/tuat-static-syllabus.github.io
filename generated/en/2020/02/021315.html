Students learn basic experimental methods and attitude (safety management, report preparation, etc.).\n\nThese experiments consist of two parts, \"Experiments of Basic Chemistry\" and \"Experiments of Physics\".\nLocation:\n\"Experiments of Basic Chemistry\":Building 1, 3F, Rooms 301-306\n\"Experiments of Physics\": Building 4, 2F, Rooms 201 and 204\n\n[Experiments of Basic Chemistry]\nStudents will learn fundamental skills and knowledge of inorganic analytical chemistry.\n[Experiments of Physics]\nStudents will learn basic knowledge of physical chemistry and experimental techniques of material science.\n\nAfter these experimental lesson, students will be ready to conduct your graduation research as an expert experimentalist.","expected_learning":"Students who successfully complete this course will be able to :\n・Make experimental preparation.\n・Handle experimental tools properly.\n・Evaluate experimental results.\n・Treat experimental data appropriately.\n・Have comprehensive discussions.\n・Write reports precisely and properly.\n・In addition, you will also learn about calibration of glassware, errors and significant figures, quotations and references.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"General Guaidance: Orientation, the safety training, and lecture about writing experimental reports, physical quantity, SI units, and significant figures.\n\n[Experiments of Basic Chemistry]\nOrientation and safety training specific to chemical experiments.\n1. How to use the basic experimental equipment for analytical chemistry: volumetric flask、pipette、burette、and electric balance.　　　　　\n2. Measurement of solution concentration: Preparation of solutions of known concentrations using volumetric flask.\n3. Calibration of one-mark pipette: Understanding an importance of systematic error in experimental measurements.\n4. Measurement of solution density: Preparation of aqueous solutions of NaCl of various concentrations. Calculation of the density of each solutions. Determination of the concentration of sample solutions from calibration curve (density vs concentration).\n5. Glasswork: Making a bottom of a test tube, a capillary for melting point measurement, etc.\n\n[Experiments of Physics]\nOrientation and safety training + seminar about experiments + experiments as follows;\n1. Simple harmonic oscillation (Examining spring constant and elastic strain energy of spring from an observation of simple harmonic oscillation of spring)\n2. Coupling pendulum (You will learn a theory of coupled vibration from connected two simple pendulum)\n3. Resonance of air core (You will examine wave motion from the measurement of their frequency)\n4. Direct current (DC) circuit measurement (You will learn basic techniques about the measurement of voltage, current, and resistance)\n5. Alternating current (AC) circuit measurement (You will learn about phase and complex numbers on AC circuit)\n\nSome experimental themes have been integrated and/or deleted to conduct online experimental class only for this year.","prerequisites":"Students are required to prepare for each experiment in order to take reasonable care for your safety and for all other students. You should read the textbook thoroughly to understand the contents of the experiments (5 h).\n\nAfter each experiment, the students have to write an experiment report and submit it within the due date (15 h).\nIn addition to 25 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to perform the above task using the textbook and the references specified below.\nIn completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\n\nAll students are required to join the Disaster and Accident Insurance for Students (GAKKENSAI).\nStudents may not work in the lab without complete compliance with the safety policy, which will be announced at the course guidance (1st day) in detail.\n","texts_and_materials":"The original textbook ed. by our department for lab courses.\n","assessment":"The grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, quizzes, report, and online tests. Standard study time set by the our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows: Normal score: 50%, quizzes, assignment test, and report: 50%. Grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.\n\nIf you have unexcused absences, arriving in class late, and late and/or missing reports, you may not receive a passing grade.\n\nPast grade distribution\n2019 S: 9%; A: 85%; B: 4%; C: 0%; D: 2%\n","message_from_instructor":"In this class, you should make a serious effort and attempt to interpret the chemical phenomenon based on the principle so that you can reach a professional level as an individual chemist.\n\nTake part in experiments (including group experiments) with positive attitude individually despite of group training","course_keywords":"Volumetric Analysis; Titration/ Colorimetric analysis; Oscillation/Vibration; Electrical Circuits; Basic Experiment; Inorganic Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Physical Chemistry","office_hours":"A/N Contact information will be shown in the handout distributed at the course guidance.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/8/2020 7:37:08 AM","name":{"id":2089,"ja":"科学基礎実験","en":"Experiments in Fundamental Science"},"instructor":{"id":1526,"ja":"坪内 彰, 兼橋 真二","en":"TSUBOUCHI Akira, KANEHASHI Shinji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Thu.1～2","references":"Reference books are useful for understanding the experiments scheduled in this course and analyzing the data.These can be available in our University Library.\nJikkenn wo anzen ni okonautameni and Zoku Jikkenn wo anzen ni okonautameni (the manuals for Safe Experiments in English), ed.
