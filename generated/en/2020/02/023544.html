That is the ability to design in the broad sense.\nThe purpose of this lecture is to learn the basics of design through design calculation, data analysis, and determination of design shape based on the drawings that is required to convey the technical information to others.\nThe lecturer of this course has the firsthand experiences on design and drawing in various corporates, and will describe actual examples from industry for case-studies, analyses and discussion.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand the drawing way of mechanical systems as following:\nDimensioning, dimensional tolerance and fit, geometric tolerance, surface roushness\nMechanical elements (screws, gears, shafts, bearings, etc.)\nVarious symbols (welding symbol, material symbol)\nTo understand the design following the procedure below\nStrength calculation of mechanical equipment, drawing of mechanical equipment","course_schedule":"1. Introduction of lecture and fundamentals of drawing\n\n2. Writing of dimension and surface roughness and drawing training\n\n3. Dimensional tolerance and fitting, geometrical tolerance and normal tolerance and drawing training\n\n4. Drawing of screw and gear and drawing training\n\n5. Drawing of bearing, seal and gear, and calculation practice and drawing training\n\n6. Drawing method of pipe, spring, and calculation practice and drawing training\n\n7.
