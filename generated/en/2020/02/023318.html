At part of “experiment about polymer physics”, Osamu ENDO and Kenro TOTANI will teach about fundamental features of polymer such as optical, mechanical properties, and the measurements. You will also learn reaction behavior and chemical temperament of molecules.\n[Polymer chemistry and synthesis]\nPolymers such as fibers, elastomers, and plastics are familiar and important materials for our lives. In the experiments, you will learn polymerization technique through synthesis of fundamental polymers and how to handle various forms of polymer materials (e.g., small particles, gel, film etc…).\n\n[Polymer physics]\nKnowledge about polymer structure and mechanical properties are absolutely imperative for understanding of physical/chemical character of polymer. In these experiments, you will perform experiments about light-scattering, which are major methods to estimate structural anisotropy in polymers. Furthermore, tensile test and experiments of elasticity will provide you information about mechanical properties of polymers. Through these experiments, you will learn fundamental studies of polymer structures and the analyses.\n","expected_learning":"To understand how to handle the polymeric compounds and evaluate polymer characters.\nTo interpret the structure and the formation reaction behavior of polymers based on results.\nDiploma policy: refer to the curriculum map in the Curriculum Handbook.\n","course_schedule":"Course Contents\n[Polymer chemistry and synthesis]\n1.
