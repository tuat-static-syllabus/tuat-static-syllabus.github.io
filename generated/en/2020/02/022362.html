Students will especially learn the concept of equilibrium through this course. Much emphasis will be put on the improvements of students’ English skills as well. For example, vocabulary tests will be conducted at the beginning of each lecture. Additionally, several workshops are scheduled to deepen understandings of the concept of each chapter through the exercises in the textbook.","expected_learning":"You can understand a basic theory of equilibrium thermodynamics such as phase equilibrium with one- and multi-component systems with/without chemical changes and the basis of the electrochemical equilibrium.","course_schedule":"Course schedule\nWeek 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Lecture (chapter 4), Physical Transformation of Pure Substances I\nWeek 3: Lecture (chapter 4), Physical Transformation of Pure Substances II\nWeek 4: Exercises (chapter 4)\nWeek 5: Summary (chapter 4)\nExamines (chapter 4)\nWeek 6: Lecture (chapter 5), Simple Mixture I\nWeek 7: Lecture (chapter 5), Simple Mixture II\nWeek 8: Lecture (chapter 5), Simple Mixture III\nWeek 9: Exercises (chapter 5-1)\nWeek 10: Exercises (chapter 5-2)\nWeek 11: Summary (chapter 5)\nExamines (chapter 5)\nWeek 12: Lecture (chapter 6), Chemical Equilibrium I\nWeek 13: Lecture (chapter 6), Chemical Equilibrium II\nWeek 14: Exercises (chapter 6)\nWeek 15: Summary (chapter 6)\nExamines (chapter 6)","prerequisites":"Students are strongly recommended to take Physical Chemistry I in advance.","texts_and_materials":"Atkins' Physical Chemistry\nOxford University Press","assessment":"The grade evaluation in this online class is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, mini examinations, reports, and online tests. Standard study time set by our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows: Total evaluation of mini examinations (including vocabulary tests) (approx. 10%), exercises (workshop) (approx. 20%) and full examinations (approx. 70%). Grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.","message_from_instructor":"Attendance at every lecture, preparations, and reviews are recommended.","course_keywords":"Thermodynamics, chemical equilibrium,","office_hours":"After finishing lecture ~ 17:00","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/21/2020 6:18:35 PM","name":{"id":606,"ja":"物理化学Ⅱ","en":"Physical Chemistry Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":600,"ja":"富永 洋一","en":"TOMINAGA Yoichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","office":"afjgxte/L1151","day_period":"Thu.3","references":""}}
