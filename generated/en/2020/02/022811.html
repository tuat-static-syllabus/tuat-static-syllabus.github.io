Therefore, it is a required subject for students training the fundamental information theory and its applications.\n\nIn this exercises, real-life problems of source coding, communication channels, and channel coding are introduced via practices mainly with the original prints.","expected_learning":"Learners who complete this course will be able to solve:\n- the notion of entropy and information,\n- the fundamental limits of data compression,\n- the theoretical limits of error correction.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps (computer and information science, diploma policy type C).","course_schedule":"1. Introduction & binary code\n2. Probability theory (sets, permutation, random variable, Bayes' theorem)\n3. Probability distribution (random variable, probability distribution, central limit theorem)\n4. Probability process (Markov process, stationary distribution)\n5. Definition of information (self-information, entropy, Shannon’s fundamental inequality)\n6. Source and channel models\n7. Examination 1\n8. Mutual information\n9. Ttransinformation and channel capacity\n10. Basis of source coding (encoding and decoding)\n11. Basis of channel coding (error detecting and correction, Shannon's first fundamental theorem)\n12. Expanded source coding (block Huffman coding)\n13. Parity check (Hamming code, Shannon's 2nd fundamental theorem)\n14. Coding theory (linear code, cyclic code)\n15. Examination 2","prerequisites":"This exercise is part of the courses in the department of computer and information science. In addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, and they are recommended to spend 15 hours for preparing and revising the lectures.","texts_and_materials":"Prints are distributed in the exercise.","assessment":"Exercises (50%), Examination1 (20%) and Examination2 (30%)","message_from_instructor":"I want students to develop a deeper understanding of information theory that is the basic technology for digital communications. I would also like to encourage students to learn how to calculate and evaluate the limitation of coding and channel capacity that we consider during the lectures, and to learn how we conduct research.","course_keywords":"Information Theory, entropy, Shannon's first and second fundamental theorem","office_hours":"From 10:00 to 12:00 on Monday.
