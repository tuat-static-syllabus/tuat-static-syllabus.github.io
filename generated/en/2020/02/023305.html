The classification, indication method, structure, chemical and physical properties of saccharides (monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides) will be described in detail according to commentary on the reactivity of enolate. After commenting on the chemical behavior of nitrogen-containing functional groups and heterocyclic compounds, we classify, display, structure, chemistry and physical properties of biological related substances and polymers such as amino acids, peptides, proteins and nucleic acids will be described in detail.","expected_learning":"【Objective】 Understand the chemical nature of amine ・ heterocyclic compound ・ dicarbonyl compound and obtain basic understanding on bio-related substances such as saccharide ・ protein ・ nucleic acid.","course_schedule":"How to proceed classes may change depending on circumstances, but generally we will proceed with the following contents.\n\n1st Guidance and Introduction\n2nd reaction of a compound having active methylene 1 (textbook Chapter 23)\nUnderstand reaction by ester enolate by learning Claisen condensation, Dieckmann condensation and others.\n3rd reaction of compound with active methylene 2 (textbook Chapter 23)\nUnderstand the high reactivity of β - dicarbonyl compounds by learning Micheal reaction, Robinson cyclization, etc.\nThe 4th Carbohydrate 1 (Textbook Chapter 24)\nLearn the name and structure of carbohydrates.\nThe 5th Carbohydrate 2 (Textbook Chapter 24) and\nLearn the reaction of carbohydrates (oxidative cleavage, reduction, condensation with amines, glycosylation, enrichment and charcoal reduction reactions).\nThe 6th Carbohydrate 3 (Textbook Chapter 24) and\nLearn the reaction of carbohydrates (oxidative cleavage, reduction, condensation with amines, glycosylation, enrichment and charcoal reduction reactions).\nThe seventh Carbohydrate 4 (Textbook Chapter 24) and\nLearn the structures of disaccharides and polysaccharides and their functions in nature.\nThe 8 th 2 nd - 7 th Summary and Exam\nThe 9th Heterocyclic Compound 1 (Textbook Chapter 25)\nWe understand that heterocyclic compounds include nonaromatic heterocyclic compounds and aromatic heterocyclic compounds and learn about the reaction of nonaromatic heterocyclic compounds\nThe 10th Heterocyclic Compound 2 (Textbook Chapter 25)\nLearn about synthetic methods, reactions, and properties of nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocyclic compounds such as pyridine and quinoline. In case\n11th Peptide ・ Protein ・ Nucleic Acid 1 (Textbook Chapter 26)\nUnderstand the type and nature of amino acids, synthesis method.\nThe 12th Peptide ・ Protein ・ Nucleic Acid 2 (Textbook Chapter 26)\nLearn about higher order structures of polypeptides.\nThe 13th Peptide ・ Protein ・ Nucleic Acid 3 (Textbook Chapter 26)\nLearn about synthetic methods of polypeptides.\nThe 14th Peptide ・ Protein ・ Nucleic Acid 4 (Textbook Chapter 26)\nUnderstand the dual helical structure of NA and the function of RNA etc from the chemical viewpoint.

Schore","assessment":"Evaluation method for online lectures:\nStandard study time set by the our university is required to get the grade. Organizing and establishing the knowledge of the students by continuing the review and preparation, and interactive learning are evaluated. Credits will be given when the learning effect is recognized. Minil test (84%) and a normal score (16%) are used for evaluation. The quizzes will be given twice for the review and preparation for each lecture. The normal point is to evaluate only questions and statements of opinion expressed to all students during class hours.\nOvertime questions are not a direct reflection of your grade points. Respond to intellectual curiosity and willingness to learn.","message_from_instructor":"Enolates and heterocycles are also important for learning about biological macromolecules typified by sugars, proteins, DNA and bio-related molecules. Since this lecture contains many important elements as organic chemistry, we hope to take active participation.","course_keywords":"Heterocyclic compounds, carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids","office_hours":"About 1 hour after the lecture ends. However, we will respond as often as possible.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"5/10/2020 9:50:13 PM","name":{"id":754,"ja":"有機化学Ⅴ","en":"Organic Chemistry V"},"instructor":{"id":1992,"ja":"岡本 昭子, 米澤 宣行","en":"OKAMOTO Akiko, YONEZAWA Noriyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"4号館248a","day_period":"月1","references":"Bruice, Organic Chemistry, 7th edition"}}
