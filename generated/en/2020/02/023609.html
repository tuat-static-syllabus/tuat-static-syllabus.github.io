To understand and explain physical phenomena on the scale of daily life, ignoring the discreteness of atoms and regarding the materials as a continuous media give us a large advantage. As a subject in the curriculum of applied physics, in this course, students will learn the fundamental concept and mathematics of the physics of continuous media, from elastic body to fluid.","expected_learning":"1.
