Research fields include “Organic Chemistry”, “Opto-electronic Materials”, “Energy Chemistry & Electrochemistry”, “Molecular Design”, “Molecular Catalysis”, and “Inorganic Solid State Chemistry”). The research theme is determined after consultation with advisers. Their studies are carried out through discussion with advisers and academic staffs in the lab. In addition, students will learn the operation procedures of various scientific instruments in each laboratory useful for promoting the research. It is necessary to handle these instruments very carefully, because breakdown owing to users' misoperations will cause heavy trouble to other users.\n[End of September] Students give a poster presentation as well as a short oral presentation in the interim presentation. At this time, each student must explain on the research purpose and results to academic staffs, graduate students, and third-year students.
