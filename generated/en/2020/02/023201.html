It is a basic science to understand life. Whole life ( Animals, Plants, Microbes ) consists of cell(s). The cell activities are important to maintain life, those contain taking nutrition, excretion of wastes, intracellular metabolism and cell-cell communication. Those phenomena are able to understand by chemistry. In this lecture, the basic 4 contents of the cell are learned. These are Amino acids, Carbohydrates, Lipids and Nucleic acids. Those maybe help to understand the cell and life.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this lecture will be able to\n1.Know the basic Taxonomy of life\n2.Understand the 4 kinds of biomolecules to form the cell\n3.Notice the importance of chemistry for understanding life\nReview the lecture as soon as possible is important to understand this subject rather than preparation.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1st lecture Guidance about this lecture, Organismal Evolution ( Taxonomy & Phylogeny ), Cellular architecture\n( Prokaryotes )\n2nd lecture Cellular architecture ( Eukaryotes ), Water ( Physical properties & Chemical properties )\n3rd lecture Guidance about 4 kinds of Biomolecules, Chemistry of Amino acids ( General properties, Structures,\nCharacterisitics and Stereochemistry )\n4th lecture Chemistry of Amino acids ( Derivatives ), Chemistry of Proteins ( Primary structure, Secondary\nstructure, Tertiary structure and Quatenary structure )\n5th lecture Chemistry of Proteins ( Protein purification and analysis )\n6th lecture Chemistry of Carbohydrates ( Classification, Configuration and Conformation of Monosaccharides )\n7th lecture Chemistry of Carbohydrates ( Sugar derivatives and Disaccharides )\n8th lecture Summary and Midsemester examination\n9th lecture Chemistry of Carbohydrates ( Structure & Character of Polysaccharides )\n10th lecture Chemistry of Lipids ( Classification, Fatty acids and Triacylglycerol )\n11th lecture Chemistry of Lipids ( Glycerophospholipids, Sphingolipids and Steroids )\n12th lecture Chemistry of Lipids ( Fat-soluble vitamins, Eicosanoids, Lipid bilayers and Lipoproteins )\n13th lecture Chemistry of Nucleic acids ( Structure of Nucleotids & Nucleic acids )\n14th lecture Chemistry of Nucleic acids ( DNA helix & Character of double-stranded DNA )\n15th lecture Summary and Final exams\nThis program is tentative plan.
