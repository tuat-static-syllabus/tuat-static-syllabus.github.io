New concepts such as enthalpy and Gibbs Energy will be introduced to deeply understand physical and chemical changes. In addition, contents are mainly in line with the thermodynamics, and include equilibrium state, molecular motion, electrochemistry and chemical reaction rate. Goal of this class is to solve a wide range of exercises related to these items and to learn the academic and practical achievement through commentaries from the answers.","expected_learning":"You will be able to learn chemistry from the viewpoint of thermodynamics. And you can understand a basic theory of equilibrium thermodynamics such as phase equilibrium with one- and multi-component systems with/without chemical changes and the basis of the electrochemical equilibrium from exercises.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1 : Equation of state for a perfect gas\n2 : Real gas\n3 : The first law of thermodynamics I\n4 : The first law of thermodynamics II\n5 : The second and third law of thermodynamics\n6 : Gibbs and Helmholtz energies\n7 : Summary of the 1st to 6th lectures\nmidterm examination\n8 : Physical transformation of pure substances\n9 : Simple mixtures (thermodynamics of mixtures, the nature of solutions, activities)\n10 : Phase diagrams\n11 : Chemical equilibrium\n12 : Electrochemical equilibrium\n(13 : Molecular motions )\n(14 : Chemical reaction rates )\n15 : Summary of the 8th to 14th lectures\nfinal examination","prerequisites":"It is desirable to attend physical chemistry I and II. In addition to the time in the lecture and for preparation , students are recommended to spend the standard amount of time as specified by the university on self-learning.","texts_and_materials":"Atkins Physical Chemistry, volume 1","assessment":"10％ on practice questions, 40％ on a midterm exam, 50 ％ on comprehensive final exam.","message_from_instructor":"This class is practical hands-on training through exercises, and you can further understand the physical chemistry. Physical chemistry is important subject that is underlying research life in your future.","course_keywords":"Equation of state, Real gas, Raw of thermodynamics, Gibbs and Helmholtz energies, Phase, Phase transition, Phase diagram, Equilibrium, Activity, Electrochemistry, Diffusion, Migration of ions, Chemical reaction rate","office_hours":"Anytime in the first floor of Room 106 of Building No. 4","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://web.tuat.ac.jp/~tatewaki/","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/21/2020 2:54:18 PM","name":{"id":2371,"ja":"物理化学演習","en":"Exercises in Physical Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":609,"ja":"帯刀 陽子","en":"TATEWAKI Yoko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"","day_period":"金1","references":"Refer to the books on physical chemistry in the library"}}
