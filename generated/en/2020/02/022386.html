Students study proteins, nucleotides, sugars and vitamin during this lecture, and for understanding these subjects especially on metabolic pathways, combination of knowledge about such carbonyl compounds as amides, esters, aldehydes and amines and phosphonic acids are highly required. Thus, it is desirable for students to confirm issues already studied in previous lectures after having explanations at the class.\nIn this course, lectures are given using Microsoft PowerPoint. In each lecture, handouts are distributed.","expected_learning":"1. To understand properties, reactions and synthetic methods of amines.\n2. To understand properties, reactions and synthetic methods of bio-related substances (sugars, peptides, nucleic acids, vitamins).\n3. To understand metabolic pathways from the viewpoint of the organic chemistry.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1st lecture: Properties,reactions and synthetic methods of amines. (Chapter 20: 20.1-20.4)\n2nd lecture: Properties,reactions and synthetic methods of heterocyclic amines. (Chapter 20: 20.5-20.8)\n3rd lecture: Classifications and stereochemistries of sugars.
