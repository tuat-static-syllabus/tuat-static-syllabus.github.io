Surface integral and flux integral\n10. Rotation of vector fields and Stokes’ theorem I\n11. Stokes’ theorem II\n12. Gauss’ divergence theorem I\n13. Gauss’ divergence theorem II\n14. Green’s theorem\n15. Term examination\n","prerequisites":"Knowledge of the courses of “Calculus Ⅰ/Ⅱ and Exercise” will be used in this course.\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"I will show in the first class.","assessment":"We planned to have \"50% for the mid-term exam and 50% for the final exam\", but if the test cannot be performed due to the coronavirus, we will inform you of alternative methods such as reports at a later date.
