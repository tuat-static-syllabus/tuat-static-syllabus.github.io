The contents include mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of polymers which are particularly important for the polymer physics. Goal of this class is to learn skills of fundamentals from the viewpoint of microscopic properties and applications from the viewpoint of macroscopic properties of polymers. This class also focuses on widely professional knowledge obtained from introduction of recent advanced research and actual experimental and samples.","expected_learning":"You can understand mechanical (stress and strain, viscoelastic), thermal (glass transition, relaxation phenomena) and electrical (dielectric, piezoelectric, conducting, ion-conductive) properties of polymeric materials.","course_schedule":"(1) Class guidance and mini test (check for related lectures)\n(2) Mechanical properties of polymer\n1: strain and stress of the polymers, p.190-193\n2: elasticity and viscosity of polymers, viscoelastic properties, p.193-196\n3: natural rubber, elasticity of rubber, p.198-199\n4: dynamic viscoelastic properties, p. 196-198, non-linear phenomenon of viscoelastic materials, p. 201-204\n5: molecular interpretation, p. 204-210, time-temperature superposition principle, p. 214-218, etc.\n(3) Thermal properties of polymer\n1: measurement of thermal properties of polymers, p.227-230\n2: transitions of polymer (melting and crystallization), p.230-232\n3: transitions of polymer (glass transition and enthalpy relaxation), p.233-235\n(4) Electrical properties of polymer\n1: dielectric properties of polymer, p.238-242\n2: piezoelectric properties of polymer, p.242-246\n3: electron-conducting polymers, p.247-255\n4: ion-conductive polymers, p.255-261\n5: applications of ion-conductive polymer (Li-ion secondary batteries, fuel cells)\n(5) Summary","prerequisites":"Polymer Chemistry I and II, Physics of Polymers and Texiles I","texts_and_materials":"Fundamentals of Polymer Sciences (SPSJ)","assessment":"Approximately 50% on reports, 30% on online examination and others\n\nGrade distribution\nFY2018　S: 4.6%, A: 34.9%, B: 39.5%, C: 14.0%, D: 7.0%\nFY2017　S: 5.3%, A: 47.4%, B: 34.2%, C: 13.1%, D: 0%\nFY2016　S: 5.6%, A: 30.6%, B: 33.3%, C: 19.4%, D: 11.1%","message_from_instructor":"Please think about practical polymeric materials such as tires, plastic bottles and fibers for shirts which are widely used around you.
