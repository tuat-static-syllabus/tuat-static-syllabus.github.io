The contents of the syllabus are subject to change depending on the instructor and operational circumstances.\n\n【Purpose】\nIn this lecture, you will acquire the knowledge on handling dangerous materials that is always required at business establishments and laboratories that handle substances, including chemical companies, and prepare to acquire the national qualification “Class A dangerous materials handler”. The aim is to use the knowledge gained through these in experiments and research activities.\n【Overview】\nThe nationally qualified \"Class A Dangerous Goods Handler\" satisfies the examination qualifications in the first semester of the second year if all the courses offered in the Department of Applied Chemistry are earned. This qualification is a qualification that can be obtained by many chemical companies when they are assigned to business offices and research laboratories.Because it was acquired in undergraduate school, it will be advantageous in future research and job hunting It is also expected qualification. This intensive lecture will be held by a person with practical experience with the aim of passing one pass to the national qualification \"Class A dangerous materials handler\".","expected_learning":"The achieved criteria are as follows.\n(1) Have sufficient knowledge of dangerous goods and be able to correctly evaluate the risks of dangerous goods\n(2) Be able to calculate physical phenomena such as state changes related to dangerous goods and explosion limits\n(3) Sufficient knowledge of laws and regulations based on the Fire Service Law. \"","course_schedule":"This lecture is offered in the form of an intensive lecture. Lectures will start in late September, with four opening dates. Please note that the course registration is required for the courses, which will start at the end of the second semester.\n\n[Part 1] Mechanism to regulate dangerous goods\n[Part 2] Classification and properties of dangerous goods\n[Part 3] Laws and regulations on dangerous goods\n[Part 4] Change in state of matter and thermal energy\n[5] Gas properties\n[6th] Change of substance\n[7] Thermodynamics and dynamics\n[8] Acid and base\n[9] Oxidation and reduction\n[10th] Handling of organic compounds\n[11] Combustion, ignition, explosion and fire extinguishing method\n[12th] Characteristics of dangerous goods of each kind Part 1\n[13] Characteristic of each kind of dangerous goods Part 2\n[14th] Characteristics of dangerous goods Part 3\n[15th] Mock test\n","prerequisites":"Students must have at least 15 credits of chemistry courses offered by the first semester of the second year of applied chemistry. If you have less than 15 credits, you may be allowed to attend the course, so if you are interested, please refer directly to Prof. Akazome at the first time.\n\nLectures require 30 hours or more of self-learning as preparation for preparation and review, studying laws and regulations, and preparing for exams.","texts_and_materials":"\"One shot passed!
