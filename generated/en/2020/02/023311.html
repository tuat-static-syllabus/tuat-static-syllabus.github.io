Students will learn the essential ideas of electrochemistry such as electrolytic double layer, electrode potential, and electrode kinetics, and will be challenged to apply them to electrochemical reactions for batteries, photocatalysis and solar cells. During each lecture, much emphasis will be put on solving exercises in textbook, which will help students to deepen understandings of the concept of each chapter.","expected_learning":"You will understand the principle of battery, solar cell, electroluminescent devices and photo catalyst.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Energy and equilibrium chemistry\nWeek 3: Electrolytic double layer, Reference electrode 1\nWeek 4: Electrolytic double layer, Reference electrode 2\nWeek 5: Standard electrode potential\nWeek 4: Nernst equation (chapter 3)\nWeek 5: Examines 1 (chapter 0-3)\nWeek 6: Photon electrochemistry; photosynthesis- electrochemical process occurs in nature-(chapter 4 and 5)\nWeek 7: Chemical reaction pathway (chapter 6)\nWeek 8: Electrode reaction pathway (chapter 7)\nWeek 9: What is activation energy (chapter 8)\nWeek 10: Examines 2 (chapter 4-6)\nWeek 11: Flow of molecules and ions (chapter 9)\nWeek 12: Surface electrochemical reaction (chapter 10)\n\nWeek 13: Examines 2\n","prerequisites":"Students are strongly recommended to take Physical Chemistry I and II in advance.Preparations, and reviews are recommended\n\n","texts_and_materials":"Chemistry of electron transfer -Introduction of electrochemistry-\nTadashi Watanabe, Asakura Shoten\n","assessment":"Attendance, Midterm and Final examination.\nEvaluation will be carried out by score of reports and quizzes (40%) and the mid and final examination (60%).\nGrade distribution Y2018, S（5％）、A（17％）、B（28％）、C（22％）、D（17％）、E（11％）\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Battery","office_hours":"0.5〜1.0 hour after the lecture","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"12/27/2019 2:17:26 PM","name":{"id":758,"ja":"電気化学","en":"Electrochemistry"},"instructor":{"id":606,"ja":"渡邊 敏行","en":"WATANABE Toshiyuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Thu.4","references":"Chemi"}}
