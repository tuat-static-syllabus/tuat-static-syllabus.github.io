The knowledge and skills are essential for conducting R & D. The aim is to gain knowledge not only of practical training but also of policy background. We will also improve our ability to prepare applications by gaining an understanding of what aspects of the grant are being reviewed.\nIt is increasingly important today that universities, research institutes, and researchers can obtain their research funds. In this lecture, I will first explain the background of the policy discussion on research funding, which is considered important in applying for research funding. Second, I will provide an overview of representative funding agencies and government funding. This overview includes the contents of publicly offered funds in the research activities of the university, and the evaluation of required results after obtaining research funds and conducting research.\nAs an exercise, the students are required to establish the knowledge and accumulate the technical experience of implementation by creating simulated application documents for typical publicly offered R & D funds.\n*The contents can be changed depending on the instructors.\n","expected_learning":"Based on the above contents, students will be able to apply for research and development funds by acquiring research-related information collection methods and formulate research plans by positioning the acquisition and management of research and development funds in their research and development process.\n*Corresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.

Preliminary {5 and 6 periods} (2 frame)\n\nPreparing for the exercises involves a reasonable workload, such as selecting papers and reading comprehension (and researching related research article). It is important to note that the preparation period is only about two months, as it is an intensive lecture format.\nDuring class time, we will set up several 30 minutes of work related to the preparation of the exercises. Questions and questions regarding the exercises will be accepted at that time.\nIn the exercise, the presentation theme is not supposed to be actual research subject of each student to avoid the inequality between full time and part time students and to control research information. To choose the proxy areas or subjects is, nevertheless, possible. This course will not aim to improve student actual applications for grants. If you need to do so, it is recommended to consult with your laboratory instructors.","prerequisites":"The students must be able to use the university library and the university academic article database. Failure to do so may make it difficult to conduct graded exercises. If you wish to take courses and earn credits when you cannot use the resource, please contact the instructor and obtain permission before registration.　\nIt is necessary to have a certain level of research skills such as reading comprehension of academic papers (knowledge on the structure of papers) and previous literature search and patent search. It is hoped that you have experience beforehand. If you have enough time, it is recommended that you have researched papers, patents, etc. as candidates for the exercise materials before the course starts (Japanese and English are acceptable).\nThe students are required to prepare and review in accordance with the standard hours of the University in addition to 30 hours of class time.\n","texts_and_materials":"The materials will be presented through Moodle.","assessment":"Over 70% of attendance is requested.\nThe evaluation will be determined by the 5-point method. Exercise presentation (40%) and a report on the contents of the presentation (60%) make a comprehensive evaluation.\nS (90-100): Superior\nA (80-89): Good\nB (70-79): Fair\nC (60-69): Poor\nD (0-59): Not Applicable\n","message_from_instructor":"The lecturer has practical experience in R & D evaluation, innovation policies and standardization strategies at the Council for Science, Technology, and Innovation, Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, and others. In the formulation of the Science and Technology Basic Plan, etc., I have been planning policy for the management of R & D funds. Currently, I am conducting research and education activities from the viewpoint of innovation theory and management strategy theory at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade, and Industry. I would like to explain the contents based on both policy practice and academic theory.","course_keywords":"Competitive funding, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI), Grants for university operating expenses, Subsidies, Commissions, R & D evaluation, Science and technology basic plans, System reforms, Emphasis policy","office_hours":"Please contact me by email in advance.
