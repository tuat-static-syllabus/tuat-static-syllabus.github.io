Based on engineer ethics, the scientists and technologists have to grasp the technical risk in each field, and prevent an accident and a disaster caused by human error and the machine trouble. Still more, they should deal everything appropriately when an accident occurs. In this class, we learn a skill to find a risk factor to hide behind the industrial activity and to manage them effectively as a researcher, an engineer.","expected_learning":"(1) To understand the concept of a risk concerning the industry technology and its management technique systematically.\n(2) To acquire the ability to find a risk factor from the examples that occurred in the past.\n(3) To learn the skill about the prevention from accidents or disasters and countermeasure for them.\n","course_schedule":"Module 1】\n1. Human error I\n2. Human error II\n3. Social responsibility and security of the university and the company.\n\n【Module 2】\n4. Risk management\n5. Risk assessment\n\n【Module 3】\n6. A machine/ system industrial technology and safety\n7. Applied chemistry industrial technology and safety\n8. Risk measures by using TRIZ\n9. Industrial biotechnology and safety\n10. Information proccesing industrial technology and safety\n11. Radioactive material and safety\n\n【Module 4】\n12. Abnormality management in the production process.\n13. Risk sense culture and its education\n14. Problems in the industrial safety management\n15. Report presentation\n","prerequisites":"Ethics is to make you conscious, and industrial safety management is to acquire the practice skill\nabout the safty. Therefore, it is recommended to take both \"Engineering Ethics \" (The first half year) and \" Industrial Safety Management \" (The latter half year )\n","texts_and_materials":"We use a document uploaded in Moodle as a textbook.
