The largest group of arthropods is insects (>1.08 million species), followed by mites and ticks (>55,000 species). This 1-credit course utilizes lectures to learn the sophisticated physiological functions of these animals that have prospered on Earth, and learn about pest management in agriculture, their utilization as food and applications to industrial products.\n\nThe first lecture will be conducted online with Zoom. If the number of participants is less than the examination capacity (39) in the classroom (BASE Lecture Room I), the second and subsequent lectures will be conducted in a hybrid style (face-to-face + Zoom). On the other hand, if the number of participants is larger than the examination capacity, the second and subsequent sessions will also be conducted online with Zoom. However, these schedules are subject to change depending on the situation of COVID, and the Zoom address, etc. will be announced via Google Classroom (code: kqaahcv).","expected_learning":"To understand basic physiological functions of insects and mites, and mode of action of pesticides.","course_schedule":"1) Guidance\n2) Biomimetics\n3) Entomophagy\n4) Pest control\n5) General acarology\n6) Advanced acarology\n7) Summary\nExam","prerequisites":"Completion of basic biology courses at an undergraduate level and Advanced Production and Utilization Systems of Biomass I is required.
