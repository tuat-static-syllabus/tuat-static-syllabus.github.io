In this course, the notion of a vector space and a linear map between two vector spaces will be introduced. We will learn various basic properties of a basis and the dimension of a vector space, and the image and the kernel of a linear map. We will also learn about an eigenvalue and an eigenvector, for deep understanding of linear algebra.\n\nThis course is taught by a part-time lecturer. Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to understand vector spaces, linear maps, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, inner products and diagonalization, and\n(2) to be capable of performing their practical calculations.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"1.
