However, as we enter an era of a shrinking population, many local communities, both rural and urban, are losing their functions. This course will require participants to learn research methods in sociology (qualitative research method and participation observation) to grasp the elements to realize the sustainable local community.\nThe research theme for FY2022 will be \"Urban and Suburban Agriculture and Farmers: The Pride of Farmers Living in Tama. The Tama region of Tokyo, where our university campus is located, is a suburb of central Tokyo, where a relatively large amount of farmland remains and urban and suburban agriculture is practiced. However, it is also true that the size of the urban green space in the urbanized area is gradually shrinking.
