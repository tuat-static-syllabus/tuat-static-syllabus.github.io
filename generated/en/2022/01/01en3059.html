In the analysis of air quality, actual measurement and simulation are the two wheels of analysis tools. For simulation, it is necessary to construct a numerical model that can simulates the actual phenomenon. In developing the numerical model, it is necessary to select the appropriate physical and chemical processes for each target event, as well as input data. This lecture explains how to construct a numerical model for the flow of exhaust gas from a chimney, and the transport of air pollutants over a wide area, as well as examples of its application.\n\nThe date of the lecture will be announced in this syllabus and Classroom until the end of September 2022.","expected_learning":"1) Students will be able to explain the necessity for simulation analysis in air pollution research.\n2) Students will be able to describe how to build a numerical model.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1.
