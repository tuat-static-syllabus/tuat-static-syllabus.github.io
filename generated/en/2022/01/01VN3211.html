General Pathology deals with general rules on the mechanisms of the lesion development in relation with etiology by means of physiological, biochemical and molecular biological assessments, as well as morphological views. This subject is a course subject by a teacher with practical experience. In charge of toxicology, the instructor has experience in pathological diagnosis in toxicity tests, and gives lectures with examples of lesions in class.","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nPlease refer to the curriculum map of our university HP (3 policies).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\nThere are a variety of diseases including neoplasms that can be observed in farm animals, companion animals and experimental animals. Animal General Pathology is a discipline that deals with the study of responses and rules to all diseases, taking into account all the pathogenic factors and morbid circumstances, which can be found in different animals, but always from a general point of view. The Animal General Pathology includes understanding of basic knowledge necessary for morphological analysis of lesions developed in each disease of animals, as well as acquisition of pathological terms necessary for conduct of diagnosis in practice.\n\nLecture on the contents of the next class.

History and conceptual aspects of pathology (textbook Chapter 1, pages 1 to 6): Historical transition of pathology, etiology and concepts in pathology; Basic structure and function of cells and mechanism of cell injury (textbook Chapter 2, 7-17): Structure and function of normal cells, cause of cellular injury, principle of injury process and biochemical mechanism, and major factors of cellular injury. It is necessary to fully understand the intrinsic and extrinsic factors of diseases, relationship between major causes and modifying factors for disease development, methodologies in pathology, relationship between diagnostic pathology and experimental pathology, and process of cellular injury and its mechanism.\n2. Cell and tissue injury and death. #1 (textbook Chapter 3, pp. 21-36): Morphological change of cell injury, and abnormalities in cellular metabolism. Degenerative change based on cell injury is a basic pathological change of cells and tissues, and it is necessary to fully understand the type of the degenerative lesions.\n3. Cell and tissue injury and death. #2 (textbook Chapter 3, pp. 37-55): Morphological change of abnormalities in cellular metabolism (continued), cell death, tissue necrosis, and senescence. Cell death and tissue necrosis are basic pathological changes of cells and tissues, and it is necessary to fully understand the type of the cell death-related lesions.\n4. Cell and tissue injury and death #3 (textbook chapter 3, pages 55-62): Inclusion body formation and post-mortem change; Cell adaptation and differentiation abnormality (textbook chapter 4, pages 63-67): atrophy, hypertrophy and hyperplasia, metaplasia and dysplasia. Atrophy, hypertrophy and hyperplasia, metaplasia and dysplasia are cellular injury and cellular responses to stress and stimulus, and therefore, it is necessary to fully understand their characteristics.\n5. Cell proliferation and differentiation and their abnormalities (textbook Chapter 5, pages 69-90): Mechanism of cell proliferation, stem cells, extracellular matrix, regeneration, wound healing, fibrosis, scar formation. Understanding the examples of tissue regeneration, wound healing and fibrosis processes are important for understanding the clinical picture.\n6. Summary of lecture contents from the 1st to the 5th, and mid-term examination.\n7. Circulatory disturbance (textbook Chapter 6, pages 91-110): Circulatory disturbance, edema and shock. Understanding of the congestion, congestion, collateral circulation, hemorrhage, thrombosis, embolism, infarction, edema, etc. is important for estimation of the spread of lesions. For this purpose, proper understanding of normal blood and lymph circulation is essential.\n8. Inflammation #1 (Textbook Chapter 7, pp. 113-134): Concept of inflammation, tissue changes in inflammation, and chemical mediators related to inflammation. Inflammation is an overall change in responsiveness to damage received by the body, and thus, understanding of this concept is one of the essential points in general pathology.\n9. Inflammation #2 (Textbook Chapter 7, pp. 135-154): Acute inflammation and chronic inflammation, nomenclature and morphological classification of inflammation, and systemic effects of inflammation. Understanding of the differences in the appearance of acute inflammation and chronic inflammation, and their morphological classification is important for understanding the cause of inflammatory diseases. Understanding of the systemic effects of inflammation is important for determining the prognosis of individuals.\n10. Immunopathology #1 (Textbook Chapter 8, pp. 155-167): Immune system and immune response. It is important to comprehensively understand the role of immunocompetent cells.\n11. Immunopathology #2 (Textbook Chapter 8, pp. 167-181): Cytokine network, allergy, transplantation immunity and MHC, autoimmune disease and immunodeficiency syndrome. Understanding of the role of cytokine which is a mediator of immune reaction, type of allergy, immune response as a response of biological protection and the mechanism of its disruption is important.\n12. Tumor pathology #1 (textbook Chapter 9, pages 185-196): Definition, classification and nomenclature of tumors, special terms used in oncology, gross findings of the shape and characteristics of tumors, histological characteristics of benign and malignant tumors and metastasis. Understanding of terminology used in oncology, understanding of differentiation between benign and malignant tumors is important for clinical oncology.\n13. Tumor pathology 2 (textbook Chapter 9, pages 196-218): Influence of the tumor on the host, tumor immunity, and origin of the tumor. It is necessary to understand the mechanism of the tumor development. In the aging companion animals, tumors occur most often, and it is an important area in diagnostic pathology.\n14. Chromosomal, gene and developmental abnormalities (textbook Chapter 10, pp. 225-234): Cause, mode of development of malformation, classification of malformation. The relation from genetic or chromosomal abnormalities to abnormalities at cell level, organ level, and individual level is important for understanding the developmental abnormalities.\n15.

In addition to the 15 times of class time, refer to the distributed lecture materials, textbooks, reference books, etc. and perform pre / post learning.","texts_and_materials":"Use “Animal General Pathology, 3rd Edition”, edited by Japanese Society of Veterinary Pathology as a textbook. Powerpoint documents will also be handed out.","assessment":"We will evaluate the grades based on the mid-term and final regular exam scores. Attendance points are not included in the grades, but if students are absent three or more times in classes up to the mid-term exam and in classes after mid-term exam, students will not qualify for the exam. If the score does not reach 60 in each test, perform one additional test.\nThe percentage of points, points of evaluation, and timing of the examination are as follows:\nMid-term exam 50%: In the 6th lecture, students will be tested on their knowledge and understanding of the lecture content from the 1st to the 5th lectures, and evaluated comprehensively.\nFinal exam 50%: In the 15th session, students will be tested on their knowledge and understanding of the contents of the lectures from the 7th to 14th sessions, and evaluated comprehensively.","message_from_instructor":"Pathology is one of the academic disciplines required for the National Veterinary Medical Practitioners Qualifying Examination. Animal Pathology is positioned between basic veterinary classes and clinical classes, and thus, it is necessary to have knowledge on anatomy, histology, immunology, and microbiology to have appropriate understanding of lesions. It will be difficult to have appropriate understandings on clinical classes, such as veterinary surgery and veterinary internal medicine.","course_keywords":"Pathomorphology, Pathoanatomy, Histopathology, Immunopathology, Oncopathology","office_hours":"13:00〜18:30.
