The first part of the classes include history, classification, morphology, structure, function, nutrition, growth mechanism, metabolism, genetics and mutations of the important bacteria in veterinary fields. It also introduces concepts and methods of sterilization, disinfection and chemotherapy for pathogenic bacteria and their infection. The seconc part introduces basics of veterinary virology, including classification, infection, growth, genetics and mutations of the important viruses in veterinary fields. The last part introduces basics of immune systems and vaccines to understad basics of important immunodetection methods. Students learn some basic methods for virus studies, including culture, quantitation and detection of the viruses, in some parts.\n\n","expected_learning":"Understanding of following subjects; history, classification, morphology, structure, function, nutrition, growth mechanism, metabolism, genetics and mutations, whichever applies to the microbes, of the important bacteria and viruses in veterinary fields, concepts and methods of sterilization, disinfection and chemotherapy for pathogenic microbes and their infection, immune systems and vaccines, virus culture, virus quantitation and detection.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:（農学部の場合）See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )","course_schedule":"1.
