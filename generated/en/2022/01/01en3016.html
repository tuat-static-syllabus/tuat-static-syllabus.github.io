In this class, we will learn viscoelasticity and glass transition phenomena to understand characteristic mechanical and thermal properties of polymeric materials, which are never observed in low mass substances. Moreover, rubber elasticity, one of the most striking mechanical properties of macromolecules, is also discussed. This course is the most primitive fundamental of physical properties of macromolecules which are quite important in environmental and natural resource since.","expected_learning":"1) Understanding of basic theory of (linear) viscoelasticifty.\n2) Understanding of genaral thermal properties of macromolecular materials.\n3) Understanding of rubber elasticity.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy: See the curriculum maps. https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1) Introduction to viscoelasticity\n2) Definition of strain, rate of strain, stress, elastic modulus, and viscosity\n3) Static and dynamic measurements\n4) Elementary mechanical models\n5) Viscoelastic spectra\n6) Important viscoelastic parameters (zero-shear viscosity, average relaxation time, and steady state compliance)\n7) Viscoelastic properties of macromolecules (time-temperature superposition principle)\n8) Viscoelastic properties of macromolecules (Andrade eq., Vogel-Fulcher eq., Williams-Landel-Ferry eq.)\n9) Viscoelastic properties of macromolecules (molecular weight dependence)\n10) Glass transition of macromolecules\n11) Factors controlling thermal properties of macromolecules\n12) Thermodynamics of rubber\n13) Statistical mechanics of rubber\n14) Summary\n15) Examination\n","prerequisites":"Fundamentals of mechanics and thermodynamics would be necessary.
