We will learn about basic ecological processes and biology for the formation of current forested landscape. We also focus on impact of timber harvesting on ecological and biological consequences. Topics related to current knowledge for mitigation the impacts and develop sustainable forest management can be included. Discussions can also be extended to theories and practices for wildlife management, biodiversity, soil conservation, and water and biogeochemical cycling. This course will be consisted by one-day field class and in-classroom lectures and discussions.","expected_learning":"By the end of this course, students will have an understanding the basic concepts and processes that shape forest ecosystems in Asia and the other regions. Students will also gain basic knowledges for applying the contexts related to forest management and conservations. Basic knowledge in this class can also be used for conducting the further field-based researches and laboratory analysis. Finally, students will obtain skills for synthesizing various issues in forest ecology and management.\n\nSee detail for CurriculumMap in the following link https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\n\n","course_schedule":"Lecture #1: Introduction of forest ecology and management\nLecture #2: Recent issues of forest ecology and management 1\nLecture #3: Recent issues of forest ecology and management 2\nLecture #4 to #7: Field class of forest ecology and ecosystem management","prerequisites":"Approprate study hours based on TUAT guildline.
