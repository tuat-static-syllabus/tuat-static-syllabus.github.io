Insect’s forms, body colors and behaviors are diverse and very attractive creatures. In the field of agriculture, insects cause serious damage to agricultural crops and some insect species that are classified as agricultural pests. While other insects are useful for human life. For example, insects can help the change of the structure of compound by their metabolism cycle. This system can be utilized for development of medicines.\nIn this lecture we understand insects from their physiological and biochemical perspectives and we discuss what these systems can be utilized for human life.\n","expected_learning":"To obtain the knowledge of insect physiology and biochemistry, and student can apply this knowledge to industrial goods. https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1.
