As global society has become increasingly aware of the value and wealth of diversity in our world, it’s vital to avoid ‘essentialized', or traditional understandings of culture. This is because essentialized understandings can inaccurately portray particular groups as having fixed characteristics.\nIn this class, we will explore difficult questions around cultural complexity, notions of identity, diversity, and power relations from a historical perspective. Culture can impact our perspectives, behavior, how we interact in the world and our personal identities. While culture is not the same as identity, and can be expressed in a variety of ways. This is to say, culture is complex, diverse, and fluid.\nThinking about multiculturalism can promote community harmony, anti-racism, intercultural understanding, and develop positive relationships between people from all cultural backgrounds.\n\nThis course is offered as one of the Humanities and Social Sciences courses of the Global Liberal Arts Studies.\n","expected_learning":"1.
