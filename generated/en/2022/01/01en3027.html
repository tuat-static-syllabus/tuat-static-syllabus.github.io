Details are as follows.\n\n1. Environmental stress treatment on plants and growth analysis of plants\n2. Observation of decomposition mechanism of plant biomass resources\n3. Observation of morphological characteristics of vertebrates\n4. Mechanism of plant biomass resources formation and biological evaluation and classification\n5. Microbial transformation\n6. Microbial degradation of artificial chemical substances\n\nThis subject is carried out by teachers who have been involved in activities outside of academia. Tarao and I. Watanabe have experience as dispatch specialists and investigation team members of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). M. Watanabe has experience working in a private company. In the class, lectures will be given with knowledge and experience gained through practical work.","expected_learning":"1. Acquiring applied biological experimental techniques necessary for environmental resource sciences.\n2. Learning the basics of academic writings.\n3. Acquiring critical thinking that makes you doubt that the following phrase is written verbatim in any syllabus.\n\n・ In terms of the diploma policy, please refer to the curriculum map on our HP (three approaches).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"1. Effect of soil moisture stress on plant growth and leaf gas exchange rate (Izuta and Makoto Watanabe)\nPlants are grown under the water stress condition, and their growth and physiological responses are examined. The test shall be conducted in three parts.\n\n2. Observation of decomposition mechanism of plant biomass resources (Yoshida)\n(1) Cultivation of fungi in a medium containing cellulose as a sole carbon source\nSpores formed by fungi shall be recovered and cultured in a cellulose medium.\n(2) Measurement of cellulolytic enzyme activity in culture medium\nThe cellulolytic enzyme activity produced in the culture medium shall be determined.\n\n3. Morphological characteristics of vertebrates (Ohji and Izumi Watanabe)\nFish are dissected, and morphological features of each tissue and organ and details of the function are observed.\n\n4. Mechanism of plant biomass resources formation and biological evaluation and classification (Funada and Nakaba)\n(1) Tree growth mechanism\nObserve the lateral meristem for secondary growth (cambial zone and cambial precursor cells), the differentiating xylem and mature cells, and the constituent cells of the outer and inner bark (phloem tissue) with a microscope to understand their organizational characteristics and the mechanism of secondary growth.\n(2) Biological evaluation and classification of resources\nIt is understood that the variation in the density, which is the most crucial physical indicator of woody resources, is related to the composition ratio and morphology of the cells constituting the xylem.\n\n5. Bacterial Transformation (Tarao)\nUnderstand the principle of transformation and gene recombination technology by introducing a plasmid encoding a drug resistance gene into E. coli cells.\n\n6. Microbial decomposition of artificial chemical substances (Tarao)\nUnderstand the principle of bioremediation using microorganisms by determining the rate constant of degradation of p-nitrophenol by bacteria.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Download the manual from the Google classroom.","assessment":"- Score evaluation is based on reports, assuming attendance at all classes (100%).\n- Each teacher evaluates the report on a full scale of 5 points, and if the average score of all teachers is three or more, the report is judged acceptable (S ≧ 4.5; A ≧ 4; B ≧ 3.5; C ≧ 3 ; D <3).\n- If you miss even one time, you will fail.","message_from_instructor":"- Lab coat, indoor shoes, safety glasses, and writing materials are indispensable.\n- Before the class, understand the contents of the experiment well. Be careful when handling chemicals.\n- Peruse the Safety Manual.\n- Obey the instruction by teachers and teaching assistance.","course_keywords":"Plant and environmental stress, bacterial transformation, plasmid, biodegradation of biomass resources, formation and biological evaluation and characterisation of biomass resources","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/16/2022 3:26:28 PM","name":{"id":262,"ja":"環境資源科学実験Ⅲ(生物学応用)","en":"Experiment on Environmental and Natural Resource Science III (Advanced Biology)"},"instructor":{"id":189,"ja":"多羅尾 光徳","en":"TARAO Mitsunori"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":14,"min":3},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Mon.3～5,Fri.3～5","references":""}}
