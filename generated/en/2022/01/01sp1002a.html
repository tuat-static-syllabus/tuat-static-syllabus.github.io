This course aims that throughout several physical activities, students learn a self-management method of the health-related physical fitness, so that students can enjoy a richly and healthy social life (including campus life).\nTo this end, course participants perform a battery of tests to measure physical fitness and motor skills, determine the optimal level of exercise intensity, and then train their physical capacity. In addition to such a physical fitness training, they exercise physical activities in various classes of sports. The final examination requires the course participants to write a short report, in which they analyze their data of the physical fitness test and training.\n","expected_learning":"There are two goals that course participants should achieve: the acquisition of the practical methods to objectively evaluate their own physical fitness and execute the self-management of health. It is expected that the participants actively learn the concept of self-management cycle to maintain and improve the health-related physical fitness: Recognizing their current states of the health-related physical fitness (Check), planning a training program (Plan), doing it (Do), analyzing effects of the training program on their physical capacity (Re-Check), and changing a manner of physical activity in daily living (Action).\n\nCompetence Development:\nAutonomy [XX], Mission-oriented Research, Problem Solving [XX], Communication skills [X], Effective Writing skills [X], Academic Ethics [X]\n","course_schedule":"Week 1: Class orientation including a lecture on the concept of self-management cycle to maintain and improve the health-related physical fitness.\nWeek 2: Perform a battery of tests to measure the health-related physical fitness (Pre-test).\nWeek 3: Lecture on the basic of fitness and exercise science. Instructions of how to determine exercise intensity and plan a training program.\nWeek 4: Execute the physical training (1): Methodology to determine optimal exercise intensity using heart rate records.\nWeek 5: Execute the physical training (2): Methodology to load muscles with their own weight (a typical method of the muscular strength training).\nWeek 6: Execute the physical training (3): Methodology to prevent muscular and ligament injuries.\nWeek 7: Execute the physical training (4): Methodology to regulate the exercise intensity.\nWeek 8: Execute the physical training (5): Understanding of the relationship between rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and heart rate (HR).\nWeek 9: Execute the physical training (6): Methodology to prevent heat stroke (effective drink of water and cooling down).\nWeek 10: Execute the physical training (7): Understanding of the relationship between air temperatures and physiological responses (e.g. heart rate).\nWeek 11: Execute the physical training (8): Devising a way to motivate exercise.\nWeek 12: Execute the physical training (9): Devising a way to regularly exercise for a long-period of life.\nWeek 13: Perform a battery of tests to measure the health-related physical fitness (Post-test).\nWeek 14: Lecture on the analysis of the physical fitness tests data and training records. Instructions of how to discuss the effects of training on the physical capacity.\nWeek 15: Final practical exercise. Understanding the significance of changing a manner of physical activity in daily living.\n","prerequisites":"This course credit (1 unit) is the minimum requirement for graduation for all the TUAT undergraduate students.\nIn addition to the class study of 30 hours for 15 weeks in total, it takes appropriate hours self-study to prepare for a short report.\nAttend the class specified by your department.\nRelated courses: Sports and Health Sciences (Lecture), Sports and Physical Activity (Practical).","texts_and_materials":"None.","assessment":"Evaluation standards and respective percentages.\n1. Practice assessment policy (up to 40 %)\nAchievement of exercise (amount of physical activity, aggressiveness, rigorous of data recording, etc.)\n\n2. Task practice policy (up to 20 %)\nPracticality (independence and originality) of voluntary efforts and ingenuity to tackle the issues of each theme\n\n3. Report a short essay (up to 40 %)\nUnderstanding of health-related physical fitness management cycle (comprehensive consideration for establishing exercise habits based on analysis of data from recording of physical exercise)","message_from_instructor":"The class participants must wear wears and shoes appropriate for exercise.
