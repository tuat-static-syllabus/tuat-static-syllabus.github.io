The goal of this lecture is to learn the basic knowledge of the cells, and to understand life at the molecular level.\nWe focus on prokaryotic cells, and eukaryotic cells including plants and animals. In the beginning of this lecture, we will learn the structure and features of the biological molecu les composing cells, structure and function of cells, and organelles and intracellular structures of cells.\nFurthermore, chemical and informational processing in the cell will be discussed, which leads to understand how biological activity functions within the cell. Here the chemical processing means metabolism of biomolecules and energy, and the informational processing means the transfer of genetic information from nucleic acids, especially DNA, to biomolecules. We learn basic genetics as well. This lecture is the basis of the specialized education in biosciences.","expected_learning":"The students can gain the basic knowledge of the cells to understand life at the molecular level.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy\nPlease see the curriculum map\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campu slife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1.
