Students will experience different styles of lectures and classes depending on the contents. It consists of two parts.\n\nPart I : Common Introductory Program\nIn this program that is common to all first-year students, students will learn about our university and think how they would pursue their academic life here. The university history and TUAT principals are described as well as our research activities, with the aim of encouraging students to engage in university study and to understanding the importance of designing their individual university life.\n\nPart II : Faculty-Specific Program\nWith the progresses of molecular biology and biochemistry, biotechnology is developing dramatically. Whereas we have been utilizing biotechnologies in many medical, pharmaceutical, and agricultural fields, some have points out many issues relating to bioethics and natural environments such as cloning and gene engineering techniques. In this class, each attendee will decide a theme of interest, look into the background, merits and demerits to our society, and finally give a presentation with PowerPoint.","expected_learning":"\"1) To understand the autonomous learning in the University, and be able to design individual's academic life at University from broad perspectives.\n2) Think about the mechanistic basis of natural phenomena\n\nCompetency Development：\nInitiative and Autonomy, Leadership and Facilitation, Knowledge Creation, Presentation Skills, Mission-Oriented Research and Problem Solving, Academic Ethics\"\n","course_schedule":"\"Part I : Common Introductory Program\n1.

In order to recognize whether you understand or not, let's make it a habit to ask questions when you don't understand or have questions. We want you to feel the importance of asking questions, not because you don't understand what you don't understand, but because you are trying to understand what you don't understand.\nI would like to explain the questions carefully. Through the repetition of explanations, questions and explanations, we hope that the students will learn how to learn as university students.\n\n","prerequisites":"\"Part I : In addition to 10 hours you spend in the class, you are recommended to review the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University for each class, to plan out the courses to take and design how you would pursue your academic activities ahead.\nPart II : same as part I\"\n","texts_and_materials":"\"Part I : 　Handouts and exercise materials are provided during the class\nPart II : same as Part I\"\n","assessment":"\"Part I (25%)：　Marks are given based on worksheets collected at the end of each class.\nPart II (75%)： based on preparation of presentation as well as discussion on presentation\"\n","message_from_instructor":"Let's think deeply!\n","course_keywords":"\"Part I : 　Questioning mind, Autonomous learning; Part II : deep thinking\"","office_hours":"It will be announced during the class.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/28/2022 5:11:56 PM","name":{"id":298,"ja":"農学基礎ゼミ","en":"Basic Seminar of Agricultural Science"},"instructor":{"id":162,"ja":"川出 洋","en":"KAWAIDE Hiroshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"Liberal Arts and Fundamental Studies","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"1-218","day_period":"Thu.2","references":"\"Part I :\n・アカデミック・スキルズ　大学生のための知的技法入門　（慶應義塾大学出版会）　佐藤望(編著)、湯川武、横山千晶、近藤明彦\n・思考を鍛える大学の学び入門ー論理的な考え方・書き方からキャリアデザインまで（慶應義塾大学出版会）井下千以子\n\nPart II : be suggested in the lecture\"\n"}}
