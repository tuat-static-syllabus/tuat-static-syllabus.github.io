Plant breeding science is an breeding science targeting for higher plants. In this course, it will be lectured that a wide range from the foundation to application of plant breeding science, as shown in \"Course schedule\". In addition, it will be also explained that the principles and methods of basic breeding techniques actually used at the site of plant breeding, introduce the present situation of plant breeding both domestically and abroad and the latest research results. This is part of the Courses of Plant Production Science, and its completion is recommended for students in the Department of Biological Production.","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is that students will be able to understand the new breeding techniques in addition to conventional methods used in plant breeding through learning of principle, theory, and methodology of plant breeding.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"Unit 1: Guidance, Description of this lecture\nUnit 2: Basics of plant breeding and genetics, Allogamous plant and autogamous plant\nUnit 3: What is plant breeding?
