When encountering an \"unknown infectious disease\" such as COVID-19, it is necessary to protect one's health and life and think about how every one’s research can contribute to battle against the infectious disease.\nThis course corresponds to the subject of Future-Forecasting Epidemiology that aims to minimize the spread of emerging viral infections by predicting future viral infections and preventing epidemics in advance. In recent years, emerging viral pathogens often transmitted from wild animals to humans. The emergence of such zoonotic viral infections involves not only animals but all environments surrounding us. In other words, it can be said that all specialized fields such as biology of plants, insects, forests, soils and oceans, sociology, economics and politics are involved in the epidemics of such emerging viral infections. This course helps students to study and take measures against emerging viral infections that will emerge next when they take courses in more advanced specialized subjects.\n","expected_learning":"1) To understand and be able to explain basic knowledge of and ways to learn zoonotic diseases.\n2) To understand the basic measures for collecting information and preventing diseases in order to practice Future-Forecasting Epidemiology.\n3) To be able to take basic epidemic prevention measures for infectious diseases in your own life and research.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"Contents:\n1) Correct knowledge of new coronavirus infection (COVID-19)\n2) What is zoonotic disease?\n3) Roles and issues of testing, treatment, and vaccines\n4) “Future-Forecasting Epidemiology” Introduction-To prepare for the next emerging virus infection\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 7.5 hours of class time and exams, prepare and review according to the standard number of hours of the university.","texts_and_materials":"\"Introduction to the New Corona\" by Tetsuya Mizutani, Tokyo Kagaku Dojin, 2020\nLaboratory Manual for Veterinary Microbiology (Chikusan Syuppansya).
