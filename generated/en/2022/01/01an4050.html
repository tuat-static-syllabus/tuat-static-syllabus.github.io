We would like you to learn the typical pattern of the \"biosynthetic pathway\", which is the chemical reaction pathway in which the chemical substance \"natural product\" is produced in the living body of animals, plants and microorganisms.\n\nLet's learn the series of processes of biosynthesis and acceptance of natural low molecular weight organic compounds with physiological activity, signal transmission and expression of physiological activity from natural product chemical thinking. I will teach you so that you can learn from the viewpoint of chemical biology, which has become established as a new concept in Europe and the United States these days. Through these, I hope that you will think more broadly about what it means to acquire scientific thinking ability and expressiveness = explanatory ability, and use it in your future scientific activities.\nThink of it as a basic discipline that deeply considers the fundamental principles of life phenomena, rather than just thinking about applications and practical applications.\n\nThis lecture will be offered online in the third semester of 2020.\nFor the code of Classroom, refer to Google's Classroom.\nThis syllabus does not disclose details for security reasons.\nPlease be sure to get information such as materials and learning methods in Google Classroom.\nThank you.","expected_learning":"Learn \"biosynthesis\" in which complex natural organic compounds are constructed from simple units, and acquire \"basic ability to consider biosynthesis pathways from chemical structures\". Understand the physiological phenomena of living organisms through small bioactive molecules. For example, (1) control by biosynthesis of plant hormones; (2) search and biosynthesis of bioactive natural organic compounds, acceptance and information transmission; (3) structure and action of unexplained hormones (new bioactive substances) can be explained and explained. Have them acquire such abilities. This is the standard achievement standard.\n\nPerspective of Diploma Policy of this subject: Please refer to the curriculum map of our website (three policies).\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"The contents are roughly divided into \"biosynthesis\" and \"biological activity\", each of which is composed based on several categories. We will embody the knowledge with actual examples as appropriate so that it will lead to more advanced concept construction.\nThe first time will be an overview, and from the second time onward, each item will be explained in two to three units from [2] to [6], but related items will be exceeded at any time regardless of the item. I will explain. I would like to consider thinking that puts knowledge to practical use.\n\nI. Biosynthesis and natural products\n1. 1. What is biosynthesis (carbohydrate biosynthesis, sugar)\nExplain the meaning of biosynthesis, the molecular mechanism of photosynthesis, and the sugar produced by photosynthesis. The structure of chemical substances is complicated, but we pay attention to the regularity, and we will introduce the chemical substances and biological functions.\n2. 2. Fatty acids, polyketides, shikimic acid\nIntroducing the biosynthesis pathway of fatty acids, the biosynthesis and action of aromatic natural products, macrolides, and polyene compounds obtained from the polyketide obtained by this. We also compare the shikimate pathway with aromatic natural products via polyketide.\n3. 3. Terpenoids, steroids, alkaloids\nIt is no exaggeration to say that terpene and steroid-based natural products are representative of plant-based natural products, and have been actively researched for a long time. Terpenes are biosynthesized in units of isoprene skeleton. Cholesterol, which is a representative of steroids, is biosynthesized from triterpenes. Learn terpene and steroid biosynthesis.\n\nII. Natural products and biological activity\n4. Endogenous bioactive substances of plants\nPlant hormones are typical endogenous bioactive substances in agriculture, and they bind to receptors and act in trace amounts. We will explain these structures and the mechanism of acceptance.\n5. Physiological function regulators such as fungi\nIntroducing physiologically active substances produced by filamentous fungi and actinomycetes and substances that act as microbial hormones.\n6. Natural products and antibiotics (function suppressors)\nAdd a brief classification and explanation of the structure and mechanism of action of antibiotics.","prerequisites":"Those who can prepare and review should take this course. In addition, an attendance table will be distributed at the beginning of the lecture. We consider that the condition for studying is the willingness to submit questions, questions, and points that you have noticed that you are going to study.\nRelated subjects such as organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetic engineering, and plant physiology will help you understand. It is possible to see bioactive substances from a wide range of perspectives. Whether you are a student who is good at chemistry or a student who is good at biology, we aim to satisfy your intellectual curiosity.\n\nThe required study time is based on the standard number of hours of the university. Of course, self-study beyond that is welcome.","texts_and_materials":"生物有機化学―第２版ー（長澤寛道・著）東京化学同人（2019年6月発刊）written in Japanese\n（We arrange and place orders so that you can purchase textbooks from the University's co-op.）","assessment":"I would like to evaluate your performance in the final examination.\nHowever, since an attendance sheet will be distributed every hour, please be proactive in writing down any questions, doubts, or observations you may have. I would like to introduce and explain excellent questions and observations during the lecture. For students who provide such topics, we will consider moving up one grade level (from an A to an S, from a B to an A).","message_from_instructor":"The lecture will explain the mechanisms by which bioactive substances are accepted and show physiological functions, using representative compounds as examples. The lectures will include the latest topics related to the contents of the textbook, which are not written in the textbook, so that students can learn on their own what they know by reading the textbook.","course_keywords":"Natural Products, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, Biosynthesis, Bioassay, Bioactive natural product chemistry","office_hours":"Please contact by e-mail if you have questions and interests","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/28/2022 11:32:07 AM","name":{"id":171,"ja":"天然物有機化学","en":"Natural Compound Organic Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":162,"ja":"川出 洋","en":"KAWAIDE Hiroshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":15,"min":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Mon.4","references":"浅見忠男・柿本辰男編　新しい植物ホルモンの科学（第3版）　講談社2016年発行\n\n「基礎から学ぶ植物代謝生化学」\n水谷正治ほか編（羊土社，2018年発行，ISBN-10: 4758120900）\n\n天然物化学・生物有機化学Ｉ（北川勲，磯部稔・著）朝倉化学大系13\n朝倉書店（2008年）"}}
