In addition, climate change such as global warming, and population increasing at global scale are challenges that must be overcome to realize a global food production system for sustainable agriculture.\n\nIn this class, the relationship between meteorological environments and crop growth and productivity will be introduced from the viewpoints of meteorology and crop physiology, and a wide range of topics from the basics the lates agricultural technologies to data agriculture.","expected_learning":"Understand the basics of meteorology and crop science, and the relationship between agriculture and meteorology on multiple spatial and temporal scales.","course_schedule":"1.
