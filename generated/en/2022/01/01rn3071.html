Next, learn the method of analyzing unsteady structures using this.\nIn addition, students learn the deflection angle method and the triple moment theorem, which are analysis methods for statically indefinite structures.","expected_learning":"(1) Can analyze truss structures and columns\n(2) Indeterminate beams can be analyzed using deflection\n(3) Elbow-type ramen and portal-type ramen can be analyzed using the deflection angle method\n(4) Unsteady and continuous beams can be analyzed using the deflection angle method and the triple moment theorem.\n\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n","course_schedule":"1.
