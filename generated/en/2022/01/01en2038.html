In addition, protein and major components of cell walls are also polymers. The purpose of this lecture is to acquire basic knowledge of synthetic and natural polymers.\n\nOutline\nThis course provides an overview of the synthesis of basic polymeric materials, as well as an explanation of the properties, analytical methods, and derivatization of natural polymers. Students acquire the basics of synthetic polymer chemistry and understand the characteristics of natural polymers.","expected_learning":"This lecture will enable students to understand the basics of polymer chemistry, including the structure, reactions, and properties of polymers.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/)\n","course_schedule":"1. Lecture schedule, overview\n2. Condensation polymerization\n3. Addition polymerization I (basic concept of radical polymerization)\n4. Addition polymerization II (monomer structure and reactivity)\n5. Ionic polymerization\n6. Other polymerization (ring-opening polymerization, emulsion polymerization, interfacial polymerization)\n7. Polymer structure, degree of polymerization\n8. Carbohydrate I (monomer properties, reaction)\n9. Carbohydrate II (basic structure of polymer)\n10.Carbohydrate II (derivatization)\n11. Lignin I (monomer structure)\n12. Lignin II (polymerization mode)\n13. Lignin III (Analytical method)\n14. Lignin IV (reactivity)\n15. Review\nFinal exam\n","prerequisites":"It is desirable that students have taken “Organic Chemistry” and “Wood Chemistry for Natural Resource Science”.\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.\n","texts_and_materials":"Prints are distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"Examinations 100%（Examination takes place at the end of the term.
