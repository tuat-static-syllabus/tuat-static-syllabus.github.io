The course intends to give a basic knowledge of physical chemistry. The subject provides a liberal arts education in the curriculum, and is also important for the understanding of agricultural sciences.\n[Overview] The lecture provides basic concepts of quantum chemistry, chemical bonding, chemical reaction kinetics, acid and base, enthalpy, entropy, etc., from the view point of physical chemistry.","expected_learning":"- Understanding basics of quantum chemistry, and understanding chemical bonding from the view point of quantum chemistry.\n- Understanding reaction kinetics and acid/base, which are important concepts in chemical reaction.\n- Understanding enthalpy and entropy, both of which are important concepts in thermodynamics.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: (A)\nPlease refer to the curriculum map at the following URL:\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/.","course_schedule":"Omnibus / three instructors\n\nQuantum chemistry basics and chemical bonding. Instructor: Keiji Hasumi\n1. Quantum chemistry basics (first half of chapter 7 in the textbook)\n2. Electronic configuration and atomic orbitals (last half of chapter 7 in the textbook)\n3. Molecular structure (first half of chapter 9 in the textbook)\n4. Molecular orbitals (last half of chapter 9 in the textbook)\n5. Review and examination\n\nChemical reaction kinetics and acid/base.
