Participants will learn water and energy cycles in the climate system with emphasis on the phase change of water. Furthermore, water-related disaster and climate variability threaten the lives of people will be understood with the examples of field surveys.\n\nThis lecture is related to classes such as “Earth Science”, “Earth Environment Geology”, “Geochemistry”, “Ecosystem Management”,“Freshwater Environment Studies”, “Environmental Soil Science”, “Atmospheric Environmental Studies”, and “Marine Environmental Studies”. Participants are requested to systematically learn the connection between Atmosphere, hydrosphere and soil systems.","expected_learning":"Students who successfully completed the course of this lecture,\n- are able to explain that climate system has specific characteristics in science and in region, and has influence on a human society.\n- are able to explain how the field survey is organized using methods when the effects of climate variability become apparent, and then how the results of field survey are implemented in society.\n- are able to explain the studied topics to the general public in an easily understandable manner as outreach activity.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n\n","course_schedule":"The lecture content will change depending on the participant’s interests, and progress of the lectures, but the following topics will be lectured.\n\n1. Overview of the environmental system of earth’s surface layer\n2. Overview of the climate system (1：Overview of various systems on the earth)\n3. Overview of the climate system (2：Overview of the atmospheric system)\n4. Water and energy circulation on the climate system (1：Various scales composing the water cycle)\n5. Water and energy circulation on the climate system (2：solar activity and energy balance)\n6. Atmosphere thermodynamics and convective activities (1：How to grasp the state of air mass？)\n7. Atmosphere thermodynamics and convective activities (2：Cloud formation)\n8. Atmosphere thermodynamics and convective activities (3：Cloud to rain)\n9. Interaction of systems of atmosphere and hydrosphere\n10. Disaster related to water (1：Natural disasters in the world and field survey)\n11. Disaster related to water (2：How society responds to disasters？)\n12. Climate variability (1：Overview of Climate Change)\n13. Climate variability (2：Impacts of climate change)\n14. Climate variability (3: Human society responding to climate change)\n15. Summary of lectures\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"There is no text book.","assessment":"Subjective & active participation to the class (ex., questions) is highly considered (60%) in addition to final exams (40%).\nThe grade distribution of the previous year is following.\n\n(2021year S: 26.2%, A: 38.1%, B: 26.2%, C: 9.5%, D: 2.4%)\n(2020year S: 15.0%, A: 43.3%, B: 26.7%, C: 10.0%, D: 5.0%)\n(2019year S: 2.9%, A: 55.1%, B: 37.7%, C: 0.0%, D: 4.3%)\n(2018year S: 15.2%, A: 65.2%, B: 15.2%, C: 0.0%, D: 1.5%)\n","message_from_instructor":"I hope that this lecture will be useful for acquisition to knowledge to understand the water and energy circulation of the earth's surface layer. The contents of the lesson will be modified taking into consideration the content and knowledge of the other classes provided at TUAT. Please do positively ask questions using question cards or e-mails.","course_keywords":"Climate system, Water and energy circulation, Climate variability, Geography, Climatology","office_hours":"The 4th time slot of Thursday. Lecturer recommends that you will send e-mail (kiguchi@ifi.u-tokyo.ac.jp) about questions and discussion because time lecturer stay at office is limited.","remarks_1":"This lecture will be conducted online by Part-time lecturer Dr. M.
