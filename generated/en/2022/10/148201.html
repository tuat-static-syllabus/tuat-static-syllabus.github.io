This broad entry to communication theory will be accessible and understandable to all students, regardless of research background, culture or language ability.","expected_learning":"To set up a structural and theoretical foundation for the practical group- and team-work exercises in Science Communication III, and also a base for the more advanced and specialized principles of communication theory that will be covered in the fall semester (Science Communication II and IV).","course_schedule":"1:\nGeneral Introduction to other students in the class and the teacher. Overview of the syllabus and general aims of the course.\n\n2:\n\n\n\nCommunication methods\n\n3:\nIntroduction to language ? how we use language each day in our lives and what styles of communication are familiar to us, both as lay people and as scientists.\n\n\n\n4:\nScientific literature and the other media sources, such as news, as examples of communication styles, and their stylistic origins and principles.

What is a scientist supposed to be? (Jokes may be used to illustrate certain stereotypes).\n\n\n7:\nReporting and composition. The students will observe a performance in the classroom and write a short description of what they have observed. Here we will gain insight into observation and descriptive skills, interpersonal variations in organizational and expression styles.\n\n\n\n8:\nHow do we deal with the paradox of meaningful communication: i.e., that our ideas must be original to be interesting, but phrased within a traditional, stereotypical framework. ‘Thinking outside of the box, paradigm-shift, game-changer etc.” ? meaning behind such phrases that are in common use today.\n\n\n\n9:\nThe role of physiological and psychological conditions in communication. In particular we will explore the value and role of frustration, arousal and other emotional affect in relation to performance, creativity and productiveness.\n\n\n\n10:\nIntroduction to presentations, or ‘public speaking’, as a key communication medium. This oldest form of mass communication will be discussed and we will have class exercises to teach us how to prepare ourselves to give an effective oral presentation.\n\n\n\n11:\nIntroduction to Group- or Team-work. Developing the communication tradition without breaking with it completely. Continuity in relationships ? interpersonal, with our present culture and past cultures, with our education structure. Concepts of originality and authenticity.\n\n\n12:\nEsthetics and unity as essences of experience and communication\n\n13:\nLevels of communication and meta-communication ('talking about' something) Shifting levels to build clarity and release communication impasses, neutralize emotional topics and unblock creative ideas and abstract solutions.\n\n\n14:\n'Life as a quest: for knowledge, fluency, inspiration, beauty etc.' Vs\n\n'The art of not trying'\n15:\nCourse reflection and discussion\n\n\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Mini-report: 50% Imposing a mini-report during class hours.\nEnglish presentation ability: 30%\nNormal score rating: 20% Attendance status.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/22/2022 2:07:06 PM","name":{"id":1501,"ja":"Professional Communication","en":"Professional Communication"},"instructor":{"id":897,"ja":"QUINN Gary（早）","en":"QUINN Gary"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering(Doctor)","category":"courses for the doctral program","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Bio-Applications and Systems Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Tue.4","references":""}}
