In that, he creates and uses various rhythms.Temporal biology is a comprehensive discipline related to the temporal aspect of life, but has evolved as a study of biological rhythm based on the biological clock, which is a time unit unique to living organisms. This year, we will introduce the current state of interdisciplinary analysis of biological rhythms, especially circadian rhythms, using various approaches such as mathematics, physics, molecular genetics, pharmacology, physiology, and cultural history.","expected_learning":"The goal is to understand the above outline and to gain a certain understanding and awareness of issues about time in life","course_schedule":"====\n\nLectures by lecturers from other universities (July) will be online, and other basic meetings will be held.
