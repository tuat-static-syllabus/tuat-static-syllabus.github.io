For example, the size of the core of the toilet paper, the shape of the USB connector, the keyboard layout of the personal computer, etc. In addition, many standards are applied, from materials and equipment used in research to equipment used in factories. Standards provide us with convenience in many ways. Good use of these standards not only enables you to perform a variety of tasks efficiently, but also to achieve high performance. The purpose of this lecture is to understand the role of standards and to learn how to use them.\nOutline of lecture\nIn this course, students will understand the importance and necessity of standards and learn how to use them through thought experiments in which they commercialize the results of their research themes while referring to the lecture content. Specifically, the items listed in the following Expected Learning are considered step by step in thought experiments. The results of these considerations are accumulated and finally completed as a report. At each step of this course, students give a three-minute presentation on their thinking for thought experiments and exchange opinions with other students.\n\n","expected_learning":"To be able to understand and explain the importance and necessity of the standards shown below, in order to make the products and services assumed in thought experiments what users want and enable users to use them with confidence.\n1.What value to provide and to who to provide its value\n2.How to protect against various risks\n3.Basic processes and related standards in development\nIn addition, to be able to understand the necessity and effectiveness of reflecting and utilizing the awareness and learning from the opinions of others in one's own consideration.\n\n","course_schedule":"1st Introduction\nOutline, Pass Criterion, Course description\n<Necessity of Objective>\n2nd Standardization of roles and its issues for business\nRelationship between standards and change of business and its environment, importance of recognizing objective\n3rd Standards refer to realization of study objective\nExample of standards roles for realization of study objective\n<Providing values and their receiver> (expected learning 1)\n4th Consideration for users\nStandardization cases considered with users and without users\n5th Elimination about fake products\nQuality assurance of products by certification using standards\n6th Standardization related technology progress\nStudy about standards related with issues on emerging technology\n<Protection against risks> (expected learning 2)\n7th Type of risks, Safety\nBasic concept making products safe, Laws and regulations, related standards\n8th EMC (Electromagnetic compatibility), Environment protection\nRelationship between regulations and standards, and their movement\n9th Cybersecurity, Protection of personal information\nProtection against risks prompted by intention, Existing problems and progress of developing standards to solve them.\n10th Land of origin, Standard essential patent, Fake products, Conflict materials\nRule, regulation, standards avoiding conflict\n<Development, Procurement, Manufacturing> (expected learning 3)\n11th Standards needed for developing products\nStandards related to materials, designing, evaluations and its usage\n12th Standards needed to distribute design information and data refer to products\nTerms, symbols, documentation system, and their role\n13th Standards for products developing process, Treatments\nDesigning, process flow developing, manufacturing, supply chain\n14th Standardization process and contents of standard\nStandardizing process of ISO/IEC and company, Structure of standard\n<Overall summary>\n15th Presentation of report\nSummary of course, presentation by all students\n\n","prerequisites":"This lecture is one of basic subjects.\nYou should attend 30 hrs lectures and required about 60 hrs for preparatory and review.\n\n","texts_and_materials":"Use text documents up-loaded to moodle.","assessment":"Evaluate the report and the degree of contribution to the lecture on a total of five levels.\nFor the evaluation of the report, the degree of understanding of the achievement criteria is evaluated(70%).\nThe degree of contribution to a lecture is evaluated by the frequency of participation in discussions and the content of remarks(30%).\nNot evaluate for student less than 70% attendance.\n","message_from_instructor":"Standards are an important tool in business.
