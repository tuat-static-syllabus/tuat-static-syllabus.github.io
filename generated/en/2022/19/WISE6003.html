A finalized version will be posted around the middle of May, 2022.\n\n\n[Purpose] To develop human resources with doctoral degrees active on the global stage, it is effective to offer foreign study or internship at an overseas institution. In this course, students engage in medium/long-term research activities or training (6 months to 1 year) at an overseas organization (e.g., university, research institution, company). Purposes include: improving English communication abilities, improving ability to engage in international research, carrying out research in English at overseas universities or other institutions, carrying out international joint research, and acquiring the ability to propose commercialization at overseas companies.\n[Overview] In medium/long-term study abroad at an overseas organization (university, research institution, company, etc.), students carry out international joint research, participate in related academic meetings, and participate in the international community.
