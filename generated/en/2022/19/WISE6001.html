Boldly envisioning it and showing it to society, students will have that idea.\n- To develop the ability to give a presentation that conveys what you want to say to your audience (you decide what kind of audience you want).\n- To discuss with experienced people in industry and academia, and refine the ability to conceive and implement ideas.\n[Overview]\nThe class will be conducted in a setting where students aim to realize an ideal society (realization of a super-smart society) in 30 years by starting a research-and-development project based on their own expertise. Lectures will be given on practical matters and points to keep in mind in order to start a business using research results. Students then make a video proposing their plans (what they want to do, what they can do now, what they want to ask for such cooperation, what they want to do by when, and what they want to accomplish in the end). The video will then be finalized with advice and discussion from the partner companies, etc., as well as with a review of all the learning in WISE Program so far, to summarize the learning in this program.\n\nCourses are scheduled between June and September. Details will be announced as soon as possible.\n","expected_learning":"Students will be able to plan projects and activities while keeping in mind timeline (milestones), based on their own research interests and results (including expected results), and in light of the future society they envision.
