Students will learn about the activities of private companies (partner companies of WISE program, etc.) as concrete examples of \"creation of new fields using one's own specialized technology and their social implementation.\" Through this, students will consider from what perspective they should look at society in order to further advance their own research technologies and knowledge and turn them into research seeds, and will consider the future development of their own research from the viewpoints of agricultural-engineering collaborative creation (fusion), diversity, and the creation of new industries. Students will present their thoughts on their future research development in the real world, based on the recognition that \"creation of new fields through advanced research capabilities = creation of new industries.”\n\nThe class will be held every Friday from mid-October to late December (4th or 5th period), and students are required to submit a report based on discussions in the class after the completion of 8 classes. Grades will be determined by class attendance, attendance attitude such as speaking up during the question and answer period, and evaluation of the report.\n","expected_learning":"As a basis for acquiring the ability to boldly envision the future and to steadily implement the results step by step, students will consider how the results of research are being utilized by partner companies and develop ideas about what is required to implement the results of their own research in society, what the issues are, and what they should do, taking into account the activities of both research divisions and private companies.","course_schedule":"The first half of each session will be a lecture. Students will learn how research results are utilized in corporate activities. They will also consider how they should look at society in order to further advance their own research techniques and knowledge into research seeds, and how they should develop their own research in the future from the viewpoints of agriculture-engineering collaboration (fusion), diversity, and the creation of new industries. In the latter half of the class, students who have listened to the lecture on \"Creation of new fields based on advanced research results and steps toward building a super-smart society = creation of new industries\" will think of their own research and express their opinions on what issues need to be addressed in order to \"create new fields and their social implementation through their own specialized technology.\"","prerequisites":"Offered to the regular coarse students (enrolled from Master course) as a required subject. Closely related with “Outline of Creation of New Industries”.\nIf students of M2 or higher grade who has taken \"Outline of Creation of New Industries 2021\" but not taken \"Seminar for Creation of New Industries 2021\" take \"Seminar for Creation of New Industries 2022,\" the content of the course will be overlapped with the \"Outline of Creation of New Industries 2021.\" In that case, take \"Outline of Creation of New Industries 2022,\" instead. The credit can be replaced to that for \"Seminar for Creation of New Industries 2022.\"\nIf a student who has not yet taken \"Outline of Creation of New Industries 2021\" but has taken \"Seminar for Creation of New Industries 2021\" wishes to take \"Seminar for Creation of New Industries 2022,\" by taking this \"Seminar for Creation of New Industries 2022,\" the student can receive the credit as \"Outline of Creation of New Industries 2022\".\n","texts_and_materials":"Assigned based on the course content.","assessment":"Submit report after the 8 classes based on the discussion in the class. Grading is done based on class attendance, participation attitude to discussion and report.","message_from_instructor":"To becoming a high-level human resource with a doctoral degree, please learn examples of social implementation by private companies in agriculture, engineering ant their related fields, and deepen your thinking by replacing them with your own research.","course_keywords":"Agriculture-engineering collaboration, Application and social implementation of research output, Creation of new industries","office_hours":"Arranged with the lecturer through WISE faculty.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"6/2/2022 10:21:39 PM","name":{"id":2306,"ja":"新産業創出セミナー","en":"Seminar for Creation of New Industries"},"instructor":{"id":2419,"ja":"斎藤 広隆, 尾崎 宏和","en":"SAITO Hirotaka, OZAKI Hirokazu"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"WISE PROGRAM","category":"","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Assigned based on the course content."}}
