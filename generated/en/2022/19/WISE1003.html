Data science systematizes methodologies for extracting valuable information from these vast amounts of data, and related fields cover a wide range, including mathematical statistics, information science, machine learning, and information visualization. The purpose of these lectures is for beginners in data science to learn the methodologies of the field by gaining a broad overview of everything from data preprocessing to the basics of machine learning (both unsupervised and supervised). This class also introduces the latest trends in machine learning in order to direct students' interest toward the ever-evolving technology of data science.\nThis course starts in the last semester. Students need to take this course in the same semester of Data Science Exercise.\n","expected_learning":"・Understand the basics of data science\n・Understand the basic methods of machine learning (unsupervised and supervised)\n\n","course_schedule":"1st session) Introduction: Data science and machine learning\n2nd session) Data science fundamentals: Data Acquisition\n3rd session) Data science fundamentals: Data preprocessing\n4th session) Unsupervised learning: Clustering, dimensionality reduction\n5th session) Supervised learning: Linear regression\n6th session) Supervised learning: Support vector machines, decision trees\n7th session) Supervised learning: Neural networks\n8th session) Future of data science\n","prerequisites":"Must have mastered fundamentals of linear algebra and mathematical statistics.","texts_and_materials":"Handed out when appropriate.","assessment":"General evaluation based on grades on mini-tests during lectures and report assignments.\n","message_from_instructor":"It is hoped that students will master the basics of data science, and put the techniques to use in actual research.","course_keywords":"Data processing, machine learning","office_hours":"As appropriate","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"10/19/2022 12:41:07 AM","name":{"id":2304,"ja":"データサイエンス概論","en":"Outline of Data Science"},"instructor":{"id":2670,"ja":"近藤 敏之, 王 鐸","en":"KONDO Toshiyuki, WANG Duo"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"WISE PROGRAM","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Introduced as appropriate."}}
