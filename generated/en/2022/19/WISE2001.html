A finalized version will be posted in mid-May 2022. Please use this information as a reference.\n\n(Purpose) Learn how the results of research in agriculture and engineering are brought to society and utilized. Learn about examples of efforts to create new industries, by inviting experienced lecturers from partner institutions and companies, in addition to TUAT faculty members. Learn basic skills as an introduction to developing problem-solving abilities.\n\n(Outline) Lectures are given by lecturers from TUAT faculty, partner institutions, and companies. Students will understand the current state of collaboration between agriculture and engineering, domestic and international companies, research and educational institutions, etc. They also learn the fundamentals of agriculture and technology collaboration (\"\"solve problems in agriculture with advanced engineering technology\"\" and \"\"solve problems in engineering with advanced agricultural technology,\"\") and to play a key role in a super-smart society.\n","expected_learning":"Based on one's own research field, students should be able to consider possibility of applying research results to actual industries and to express their opinions on new industries creation.","course_schedule":"A \"super-smart society\" is a safe, secure, and sustainable society in which results of advanced researches are effectively applied. In this course, students will learn practical examples of research in which agriculture and engineering are seamlessly integrated, as well as real-life examples in industrial sectors. A total of 8 omnibus lectures by each lecturer. A report will be submitted at the end.\n","prerequisites":"Offered as a required course of the WISE Program.","texts_and_materials":"Assigned based on the case studies brought in by each lecturer.","assessment":"General evaluation of assignments tailored to the case studies brought in by each lecturer.","message_from_instructor":"Through this introduction to becoming a high-level human resource with a doctoral degree, it is hoped that students will learn interdisciplinary case studies, involving not only agriculture and engineering but also economics, ethics, and policy, together with specialized terminology.","course_keywords":"Agriculture-engineering collaboration, creation of new industries","office_hours":"Guidance will be provided by instructors from each company participating in the Consortium for the Creation of New Industries of the WISE Program.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/8/2022 5:21:53 PM","name":{"id":2305,"ja":"新産業創出概論","en":"Outline of Creation of New Industries"},"instructor":{"id":2418,"ja":"滝山 博志, 尾崎 宏和, 澁澤 栄","en":"TAKIYAMA Hiroshi, OZAKI Hirokazu, SHIBUSAWA Sakae"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"WISE PROGRAM","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Assigned based on the case studies brought in by each lecturer."}}
