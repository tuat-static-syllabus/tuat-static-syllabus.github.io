The faculty members in charge will evaluate the students’ performance and grant credits and competencies.\n　Regular courses offered in students’ departments are not eligible for this course. In addition, the credits and competencies earned in these courses are not included in the credits required for QE or the program completion, or the observation/behavior evaluations for QE, but will be referred to as additional information.\n\n※ As a reference, the WISE program may provide recommended seminars that are eligible for this course.\n※ Applications can be processed via the portfolio system.
