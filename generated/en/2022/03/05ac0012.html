This lecture is the professional subject of the biological-production science course.\n\nThe lecture by Dr.Nakagawa:\nCrop growth models, especially for rice, will be discussed in terms of their basic structure, theory, history and current research topics. Also, application studies of crop growth models will be introduced, such as the impact assessments of climate change and constructing an agrometeorological information system.\n\nThe lecture by Dr. Shibuya:\nVarious issues and latest topics on biological production science will be discussed. The theme of this lecture is flower senescence and postharvest technology.","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n\nThe lecture by Dr. Nakagawa:\nUnderstanding the basics of crop growth model and its application to various simulation studies.\n\nThe lecture by Dr. Shibuya:\nUnderstanding the senescence mechanism and quality retention technology of cut flowers.","course_schedule":"The lecture by Dr. Nakagawa:\nSchedule: September 15 and 16, 2022. The time is undecided*.\nClassroom: undecided*\n*It will be notified on a web bulletin board or Classroom.\n1. The basics of crop growth models ? theory and history\n2. The structure and function of rice growth models\n3. Predicting the impact of climate change on crop production\n4. An agrometeorological information system for rice, wheat and soybean\n\nThe lecture by Dr. Shibuya:\nSchedule: September 3, 2022. The time is undecided*.\nClassroom: undecided*\n*It will be notified on a web bulletin board or Classroom.\nFlower longevity is one of the most important traits for ornamental plants. Understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of flower senescence is needed to efficiently develop postharvest technology. This course provides an overview of postharvest biology and technology of cut flowers.","prerequisites":"In addition to class hours, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"The lecture by Dr. Nakagawa:\nHandouts (or PDF files)\n\nThe lecture by Dr. Shibuya:\nHandouts (or PDF files)","assessment":"The lecture by Dr. Nakagawa:\nDegree of proactive participation (50%) and report after the lecture (50%)\n\nThe lecture by Dr. Shibuya:\nExaminations 100%","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"The lecture by Dr. Nakagawa: crop growth model, climate change, crop production, The lecture by Dr. Shibuya: flower senescence, programmed cell death, quality management","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"The lecture by Dr. Shibuya: http://www.naro.affrc.go.jp/","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/9/2022 11:08:41 AM","name":{"id":2143,"ja":"生物生産科学特論Ⅱ","en":"Special Lecture on Agricultural Production Sciences Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":2595,"ja":"渋谷 健市, 中川 博視, 山田 哲也, 大川 泰一郎","en":"SHIBUYA Kenichi, YAMADA Tetsuya, OKAWA Taiichiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学府","category":"","department":"","semester":"2学期","course_type":"2学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"6-406","day_period":"集中","references":""}}
