Therefore, it is a required subject for students learning Field of Functional Control of Natural Resources.\n\nProf. Suzuki will give lectures on the chemical structure, biosynthesis, functions, and utilization of key components constructingf lignocellulosic biomass and trace amounts of useful components (secondary metabolites) contained in plants. Students study the knowledge and technology required to develop higher functional and more valuable lignocellulosic biomass and functional foods to contribute to future society.\n\nProf. Sekita will give a lecture on theories and practices as the basis of cooperative learning necessary for the forest environmental education and the forest ESD.","expected_learning":"Prof. Saito:Students will understand the fundamental information on the chemical structure, reactivity, and bioactivity of the components of lignocellulosic biomass and the trace amounts of useful components in plants, as well as current issues and countermeasures, and application examples.\n\nProf. Sekita: students can experientially learn some of the specific structures based on the concept of cooperative learning, that promote the proactive interactive and deep learning. And students can prepare a guidance plan for the forest ESD as forest environmental interpreters.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/)\n","course_schedule":"Prof. Suzuki will give lectures as follows,\n1) Chemical structure and biosynthesis of hemicellulose\n2) Modification of hemicellulose\n3) Evolution of lignin biosynthesis and its diversity\n4) Chemical structure and biosynthesis of trace amounts of useful components in plants\n5) Function and utilization of trace amounts of useful components in plants\n\nProf. Sekita will give lectures as follows,\n1) Features of cooperative learning\n2) Features of Kagan structure\n3) Points to note in active learning that promote proactive interactive and deep learning\n4) Preparation of guidance plan","prerequisites":"Students are recommended to spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.","texts_and_materials":"Prof. Suzuki:Handouts will be given as needed.\n\nProf. Sekita: \"Kagan Cooperative Learning Structure\", Daigakutoshoshuppan.\n","assessment":"Prof. Suzuki:Assessment will be calculated according to Usual performance score and Report (50 %).\n\nProf. Sekita:Assessment will be calculated according to Usual performance score and Report (50 %).\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Prof. Suzuki:Biomass, hemicellulose, lignin, trace amounts of useful components in plants Prof. 　　Sekita: cooperative learning, active learning, Kagan structure, proactive interactive and deep learning","office_hours":"Prof. Suzuki:Contact by an e-mail. shiro_s@gifu-u.ac.jp.; Prof. Sekita:Contact by an e-mail.sekita@soka.ac.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/16/2022 2:18:50 PM","name":{"id":2215,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅲ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅢ"},"instructor":{"id":2617,"ja":"鈴木 史朗, 関田 一彦, 堀川 祥生, 佐藤 敬一","en":"HORIKAWA Yoshiki, SATO Keiichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学府","category":"","department":"","semester":"2学期","course_type":"2学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":"Prof. Suzuki: Mokushitsu no Keisei (Secondary Xylem Formation), 2nd ed., Kaiseisha; Kiso kara Manabu Shokubutsu Taisha Seikagaku (Plant Metabolic Biochemistry from the Basics), Yodosha\n\nProf. Sekita: Active Learning no Giho ・Jugyo Design, Toshindo.\n"}}
