In particular, the lecture will be based on the latest findings on life phenomena, cell differentiation mechanisms, and environmental adaptability of trees that form woody biomass. In addition, in vivo imaging techniques, which are important for elucidating plant life phenomena, will be discussed.\n\nYoshida:\nStudents will learn about the control of biodegradation and the ecology of fungi that cause the biodegradation of woody biomass, as well as the latest information on these topics.\n\nKose:\nOne of the methods to utilize woody biomass as a material is the use of paper made from pulp fibers obtained by isolating the fibrous cells of woody biomass. Recently, it has become possible to prepare cellulose nanofibers from pulp fibers as an advanced nanomaterial. In this lecture, we will learn the concept of material application of natural fibers through the scientific knowledge of pulp fiber and paper, and also learn the properties of nanomaterials derived from natural fibers.\n\nNakaba:\nWe will learn about the relationship between the structure of woody biomass and its material properties. Students will also learn the latest information on the mechanism of heartwood formation.\n\nThis lecture is positioned as a specialized course to acquire specialized knowledge on the utilization of woody biomass, especially on the resource function control science of this program.","expected_learning":"Funada:\nTo understand the basic structure of plant cells and the basic mechanisms of division and differentiation.
