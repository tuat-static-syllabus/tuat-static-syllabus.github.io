Prof. Kiuchi (The university of Tokyo) and Dr.Hanajima (National Agriculture and Food Research Organization) on 2nd semester. This lecture is the professional subject of the biological-production science course.\n\nThe lecture by Assoc. Prof. Kiuchi:\nThe silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a domesticated and improved insect which produces vast amounts of silk protein. In addition, genetically modified silkworms can produce functional silk and recombinant proteins. Recently, next-generation sericulture using genetically modified silkworms is developing in Japan. Under such situation, we attempt to produce more useful gene modified silkworm using knowledge from genetic study about sex determination, host plant selection, and diapause induction, etc. In this lecture, I will introduce our studies including methods of silkworm genome editing.\n\nThe lecture by Dr. Hanajima:\nAnimal waste generated by the livestock industry has been utilized as organic fertilizer, however, the odor as well as pollutants involved in waste occasionally cause environmental problems. This lecture outlines the environmental issues related with animal waste, the waste treatment technology for mitigating environmental impacts and the sustainable organic resource recycling.\n","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n\nThe lecture by Assoc. Prof. Kiuchi:\nStudents are expected to learn molecular mechanisms of sex determination, host plant selection, and diapause induction in insects and will be able to discuss about agricultural applications of gene modified insects.\n\nThe lecture by Dr. Hanajima:\nStudents are expected to learn the environmental issues and regulations related with animal waste management and will be able to discuss about the methods to control environmental pollution and the sustainable organic resource recycling.\n","course_schedule":"The lecture by Assoc. Prof. Kiuchi:\nSchedule: 9/6\nClassroom: Undecided (we will be posted at a later date)\n1) Sex determination system in insects\n2) Molecular basis of host plant selection in insects\n3) Molecular mechanisms of diapause induction in insects\n4) Genome editing in insects\n\nThe lecture by Dr. Hanajima:\nSchedule: 9/1\nClassroom: Undecided (we will be posted at a later date)\n1) Environmental issues related with animal waste\n2) Regulations with regards to animal waste management\n3) Waste treatment technology for mitigating environmental impacts\n4) Sustainable organic resource recycling\n","prerequisites":"In addition to class hours, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"The text will be introduced in lectures.","assessment":"The lecture by Assoc.
