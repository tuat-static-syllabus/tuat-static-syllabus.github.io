Students then improve ability for laboratory experiment, field survey, and reading papers. Especially, topics such as agricultural science, applied life science, ecology can be included. Planning and designing experiments and monitoring were also included in this class. Applications of specific statistical software will be demonstrated in this class.","expected_learning":"Understand the basics of statistics as basic subjects necessary for conducting research in agriculture and related fields, understand the processing of data using interpretive statistical methods, and the interpretation method of results. The following three points are the reaching criteria.\n1. Understand the basics of statistics\n2. Methods that can statistically process phenomena related to agriculture and related fields\n3. Evaluation of judgment and validity of contents obtained by analysis result\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"1.
