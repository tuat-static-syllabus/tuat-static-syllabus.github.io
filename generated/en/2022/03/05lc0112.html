Cells are separated from the outside by the cell membrane, and organelles are surrounded by the organelle membrane. Each of these biological membranes is formed to have a characteristic shape and an appropriate size, and abnormal morphogenesis of the membrane can cause diseases in human. In this lecture, you will learn about the molecular mechanism of morphogenesis of biological membranes. In addition, we will learn about yeast genetics research, which has been useful in elucidating various biological phenomena including biological membrane formation.\n\nTOKUYASU, Ken (Food Research Institute, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization)\nAccumulation of research accomplishments in the fields of applied glycoscience and science of carbohydrate-related enzymes has created various ingenuity for converting carbohydrate resources into value-added food materials. In fact, many materials such as high-fructose corn syrup, low cariogenic oligosaccharides, oligosaccharides that regulate the intestinal environment, non-calorie/low-calorie sweeteners, and indigestible dextrin with bioregulatory function have been developed and launched in Japan and overseas. At present, the enzymatic- and microbial conversion technologies that have supported these developments as core technologies is expected to play a role not only in bioprocesses for foods, chemical products and pharmaceuticals, but also in those for biomaterials for reaching the bioeconomy. Under these circumstances, in this lecture, we will deepen our understanding of the technologies for utilizing carbohydrate resources by introducing knowledge about the characteristics of carbohydrate resources and bioconversion technologies for utilization of carbohydrate resources via examples of the developments.\n","expected_learning":"[TACHIKAWA Hiroyuki]\n- Understanding how organisms form and use membrane structures.\n- Understanding the importance of research using yeast in this field.\n\n[TOKUYASU Ken]\n- Understanding basic properties and bottlenecks for industrial application of carbohydrate resources\n- Understanding bioconversion technologies for utilization of carbohydrate resources via examples of the developments\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: (A) and (D)\nPlease refer to the curriculum map at the following URL:\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"[TACHIKAWA Hiroyuki] (Date: September 5th)\n1.
