We will also introduce agricultural technology that utilizes these mechanisms.\n\nThis lecture is special lecture of the Department of Science of Biological Production.","expected_learning":"Corresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n(URL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/ )\n\nThe lecture by Prof. Yoshioka:\n(1) Obtain basic knowledge about current and perspective status of the development of the system for accurate reproductive management and prevention of reproductive failure using IoT.\n(2) Understand assisted reproductive technologies in pigs.\n\nThe lecture by Prof. Ito:\nUnderstand and explain the stress tolerance mechanism of plants and sustainable farming methods that utilize their properties.\n","course_schedule":"The lecture by Prof. Yoshioka:\nSchedule: 30, Aug\nClassroom:Undecided (we will be posted at a later date)\n1. 2. Cattle:\nDevelopment of wearable wireless sensor, system for accurate reproductive management using the IoT.\n3. 4. Pig:\nIn vitro embryo production, Embryo transfer, Ovum pick up, Deep intrauterine insemination of frozen-thawed semen, etc\n\nThe lecture by Prof. Ito:\nSchedule: 2, Sep\nClassroom:Undecided (we will be posted at a later date)\n1. What is the stress tolerance mechanism of plants?\n2. Plant-animal-insect interaction (evolution and secondary metabolites), plant-plant interaction (utilization of allelopathy)\n3. Plant-microbial interaction (mutual recognition mechanism and infection mechanism of symbiotic microorganisms and plant growth promoting microorganisms)\n4. Examples of agricultural use of stress-tolerant plants\n\n","prerequisites":"In addition to class hours, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"The lecture by Prof. Yoshioka: 50%\nNormal score 20% Evaluate the degree of independent participation in class\n\nThe lecture by Prof.Ito:\nNormal score 20% Evaluate the degree of independent participation in class","message_from_instructor":"The lecture by Prof. Ito:\nThere are various species of plants, each of which has its own mechanism to adapt to the environment.
