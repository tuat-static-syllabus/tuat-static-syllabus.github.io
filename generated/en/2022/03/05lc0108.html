The glycan affects property and function of protein and plays the important role in recognition of cell-cell or cell-molecule interaction. The glycosylation is a posttranslational modification and is successive reaction to which monosaccharide is added by each specific glycosyltransferases. Thus, the glycosylation is susceptible to various factors from environment, aging and etc. In this lecture, I will review from the basics of glycosylation to the diseases by abnormal glycosylation.\n\n“Environmental Physiology” (UCHIDA, Sae)\n　　This lecture will provide an overview how the autonomic nervous system supports bodily functions and living behaviors that adapt to environmental changes. The various bodily functions fluctuate synchronizing with the sleep-wake rhythm that depends on day and night. For example, body temperature rises during awake hours, supporting an active physical state. On the other hand, body temperature is maintained at a constant level even under severe heat and cold environmental conditions. In addition, respiration, blood pressure, heart rate, hormone secretion, etc. change in response to physical and mental stress and emotions. The autonomic nervous system, which detects changes in internal and external environment and integrates the information to trigger biological responses, is being elucidated.\n","expected_learning":"“Glycosylation and aging-related diseases” (MANYA, Hiroshi)\n1) Learn about the research in aging-related diseases\n2) Learn the importance of biological function of glycosylation\n\n“Environmental Physiology” (UCHIDA, Sae)\n1) Understand the function of autonomic nervous system involving the basis of human behavior.\n2) Lean the relationship between the autonomic nervous system and stress and emotions.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy: See the curriculum maps. https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/\n","course_schedule":"Month-date\n“Glycosylation and aging-related diseases” (MANYA, Hiroshi)\n1) Basic of glycobiology\n2) Glycosylarion and aging, disiease.\n3) Aging-model mouse\nI will illustrate the basic of glycobiology, the approach to glycobiology and the relation between glycosylation and aging-related diseases with introduction of my study.\nMonth-date\n“Environmental Physiology” (UCHIDA, Sae)\n1) Sleep-wake cycle and the autonomic nervous system\n2) Body temperature regulation and the autonomic nervous system\n3) Stress and the autonomic nervous system　\n4) Emotions and the autonomic nervous system\nThis lecture will focus on the function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) that is influenced by sleep/wake rhythms, regulates body temperature.
