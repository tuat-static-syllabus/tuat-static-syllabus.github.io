In FY2019-2020, we took up the theme of forests and read books on forest history. In FY2021, with the cooperation of Prof. Takeshi Yokoyama of the Laboratory of Silkworm Science and Assistant Prof. Yurika Saito of the Museum of Science, we read some books on the history of sericulture. FY2022, continuing the theme from last year, we are planning to read several books including 佐野静代『外来植物が変えた江戸時代』(吉川弘文館、2021年).\n\nNotes on the course\nEach participant will take it in turn to be a reporter (or moderator, as the case may be) for the readings. It is assumed that all participants, including non-reporters, will have read the relevant parts of the book in advance of the class. As we will be reading several research books in one semester, the number of pages to be read in each class will be considerable. It is essential that students read the book before attending. Please note that it is also necessary for students to obtain their own copies of the readings in advance.\n\nSchedule (To be confirmed in class)\nLesson 1. Guidance\nLesson 2.
