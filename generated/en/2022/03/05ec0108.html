Furthermore, participants will also experience C and N stable isotopes analyses including sample processing.\n\n[Watanabe] (6 or 7 lectures from November to December)\nGive presentations on environmental chemistry and discuss with everyone. Set the theme (type and number of times) according to the number of students every year.
