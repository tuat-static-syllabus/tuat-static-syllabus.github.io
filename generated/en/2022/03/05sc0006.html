In a summary to be distributed, a student has to write what she/he cannot understand as well as what she/he would like to discuss in class, related to the contents in the assigned part, in addition to a summary of the contents.\n\n【Term-paper + Presentation】\n　A student should choose a region she/he is interested in, then investigate the feature of agriculture of such a region, with emphasis on agricultural resource endowment and its present use situations. A student should submit the paper that summarizes your investigation in the form of 8-10 pages (double spaced, Times New Roman 11pts) including tables and figures. In addition, a student is required to make an oral-presentation about your paper using the power point slides for 15-20 minutes in class.\n\nThe lecturer of this course has substantial experiences as a consultant for agricultural and water resource development and will sometimes use the situations he had observed in rural areas to help students to deepen their understanding of the contents given.","expected_learning":"Students are required to understand the use of agricultural resources in the process of economic development from an economic perspective, apply that knowledge to actual problems, and express their opinions logically, both verbally and in writing.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.
