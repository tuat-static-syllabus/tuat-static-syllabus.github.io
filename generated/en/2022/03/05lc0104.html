The lecture also provides students with the knowledge needed to develop solutions for research on applied life sciences.\n\nThis lecture introduces the latest knowledge of protein crystallography and some structures of enzymes, glycobiology, genetic modified organisms (GMOs) and genome edited organisms (GEOs), and research on filamentous fungi and its application. In the lecture, PowerPoint software is mainly used for a clear indication of the key points.\n","expected_learning":"- Understanding the latest knowledge of protein structure analysis and structures of some enzymes.\n- Understanding the latest knowledge of glycobiology.\n- Understanding the latest knowledge and applications of GMOs and GEOs.\n- Understanding the latest knowledge of research on eukaryotic microorganisms (mainly filamentous fungi) and its application, and acquiring skills in the development of research.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: (A) and (D)\nPlease refer to the curriculum map at the following URL:\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/.\n","course_schedule":"Omnibus/15 periods total\n\nTakashi Tonozuka (4 periods)\n- The lecture provides an overview and methods of protein X-ray crystallography. The lecture also introduces properties and three-dimensional structures of enzymes acting on carbohydrates, which are useful in the field of agricultural and food sciences.\n\n1. Enzymes acting on starch and related carbohydrates\n2. Enzymes acting on plant biomass\n3. What is the protein X-ray crystallography?\n4. Methods of the protein X-ray crystallography\n\n\nYouhei Yamagata (4 periods)\n- The lecture introduces molecular biology of eukaryotic microorganisms (mainly filamentous fungi), which has recently made a great advance, from a classical fermentation study to recent knowledge of growth, and production of useful substances.\n\n4. Eukaryotic microbes in the fermentation\n5. Safety of fungi\n6. Molecular biology of fungi growth\n7. Transcriptional regulation of fungi and their metabolite production\n\nShinya Kawai (4 periods)\n- Many genetically modified crops are commercially cultivated. We will learn backgrounds and principles of GMOs and New Plant Biotechnologies for GEOs, Chimeric REpressor Gene Silencing and flowering stimulant by ASLV, FT and TFL, and etc.\n\n8. Plant transformation methods: (1) Methods of gene introduction to nuclei\n9. Plant transformation methods: (2) Plastid transformation and plant virus vectors\n10. Genome editing methods (ZFNs and CRISPR-Cas9) and New Plant Biotechnology\n11. Applications and statistics of Genetically Modified Crops\n\nMizuki Tanaka (2 periods)\n-Microorganisms regulate the expression level of individual genes in response to the external environment, such as nutrient sources.\nThis lecture introduces the regulatory mechanism of gene expression in eukaryotic microorganisms, especially the regulation of hydrolytic enzyme gene expression in filamentous fungi.\n\n13. Transcriptional regulation by transcription factors\n14. Carbon catabolite repression\n\nAtsushi Nishikawa (1 period)\n- Many glycoproteins can be found in organisms, and “glycochains”, that are polymers composed of various sugars, bind to the glycoproteins. The glycochain has been elucidated in recent years as its third chain next to proteins and nucleic acids, and the functions have been clarified in various stages such as development, differentiation, proliferation, and canceration. This lecture provides outline of the physiological functions of glycochains, including the role in glycoproteins that have recently been used as \"drugs\".\n\n15.
