The outline of the lecture is as follows.\nLearn and deepen the understanding about environmentally friendly polymers to explore the way for effective use of biomass resources in terms of their social background, chemical structures, properties, synthesis and processing.\nEnvironmentally friendly polymers can be classified into two types. One is biomass plastics produced from biomass, which is a renewable resource, and second is biodegradable plastics, which are degraded by enzymes secreted by microorganisms in the environment. In this lecture, students will learn about the social background, classification, chemical structures, physical properties, and biodegradability of environmentally friendly polymers. In addition, students will deepen their understanding of the synthesis and physical properties of commodity plastics, the basics of recycling, recent researches on the synthesis and materialization of biomass plastics, and the strategy for utilization of biomass resources.\nIt will be updated during the summer vacation.\n\nProf. Tadashi Ohtani of Tokyo Gakugei University. The outline of the lecture is as follows.\nWith the recent demand for a low-carbon society worldwide, in the world of wood use, correct understanding for the use of wood, especially domestic timber, and the treatment for processing wood is an important role. This lecture is aim to deep understanding of the use of wood in a low-carbon society, and discussing the research results of the forefront of wood processing from the viewpoint of processing biological materials. In addition, based on this lecture, as a young researcher (graduate student) in a research organization, the lecture is considered our own research value to induce scientific and technological innovation when engaging in research on environmental resources and material science. Furthermore, based on the current state of innovation research in Japan, the aim is to deepen the understanding of how each research theme contributes to the utilization of environmental resources and material science.\n\n","expected_learning":"You can learn the latest information on Environmental Science and Natural Resources.\n\nThe educational achievement of this lecture is to learn the basics such as social background, types and properties of environmentally friendly polymers. Students will also be able to explain the synthesis and materialization of plastics derived from biomass, development guidelines, and future performance requirements.\n\nLearn and deepen the understanding about environmentally friendly polymers to explore the way for effective use of biomass resources in terms of their social background, chemical structures, properties, synthesis and processing.\n\nUnderstand low-carbon societies and the use of wood in Japan.\nUnderstand the principle of processing.\nTo deepen understanding of advanced research on processing of biological materials.\nUnderstand the relationship between science and technology research in Japan and innovation.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\nURL: https://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"Intensive lecture will be held from the latest information on Environmental Science and Natural Resources.\n\nProf. Yukiko Enomoto\n1st Current situation and issues of plastics, overview of biomass plastics and biodegradable plastics\n2nd Eco-friendly plastics\n3rd Polymer synthesis 1\n4th Polymer synthesis 2\n5th Bio-based monomers and biomass plastics\n6th High heat-resistant biomass plastics\n7th Aromatic biomass plastics\n8th Sugars and Polysaccharides\n9th Cellulose derivatives\n10th Polysaccharide-based biomass plastics.\n\nProf. Tadashi Ohtani\n1) Low carbon society and wood use\n2) Study on processing science of biological materials\n3) Science and technology research and innovation\n","prerequisites":"Students are recommended to spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University","texts_and_materials":"Distribute prints as appropriate.","assessment":"Regular point(50%) and report submission(50%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Eco-friendly polymers, Biomass plastics, Biodegradable plastics, Polysaccharides, Aromatic bioplastics","office_hours":"Please request an appointment by email.","remarks_1":"It will be updated during the summer vacation.","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/7/2022 10:11:21 AM","name":{"id":2213,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅰ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅠ"},"instructor":{"id":2615,"ja":"榎本 有希子, 大谷 忠, 小瀬 亮太, 安藤 恵介","en":"ENOMOTO Yukiko, OOTANI Tadashi, KOSE Ryota, ANDO Keisuke"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"2nd","course_type":"2nd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Introduce in class if necessary."}}
