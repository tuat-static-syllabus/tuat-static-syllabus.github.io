This class comprised of the lectures by two specialists deals with the problems of air pollution and climate change from interdisciplinary viewpoints including not only natural science but also social science.","expected_learning":"Students are required to understand the overview of the quantitative cause-and-effect relationships between various chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere and to understand how interdisciplinary viewpoint is useful in the analyses of climate changes.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma policy:\nSee the curriculum maps.\nhttps://www.tuat.ac.jp/campuslife_career/campuslife/policy/","course_schedule":"Omnibus/15 periods total\n\nMizuo Kajino (7 periods)\n- Nitrogen compounds and ozone, which affect the growth of plants, react in the atmosphere, and repeatedly generate and disappear while going back and forth between the gas phase and particle phase. The chemical reactions and aerosol dynamics processes in the atmosphere are highly nonlinear and thus it is difficult to imagine the whole picture. In this lecture, comprehensive and more essential matters are outlined without details to gain an overall understanding of the quantitative causal relationships of these chemical and physical processes occurring in the atmosphere.\n\n1. Primary emission (direct emission to atmosphere)\n2. Secondary production (production in the atmosphere)\n3. Aerosol dynamics\n4. Cloud processes\n5. Deposition processes\n6. Feedback to meteorological processes\n7. Numerical simulations\n\n\nGenki Katata (8 periods)\n- Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions with a progress in technology are believed to cause today’s risks of global warming and its various harmful impacts on the biosphere and humanities. Although this narrative is possible to some extent, if we, “interdisciplinary scientists”, investigated what happened to human society under climate changes in the past, the problem is not so straightforward. This course for master’s students is to learn how the interdisciplinary research helps to solve various environmental issues.\n\n8. Environmental history as interdisciplinary research\n9. Numerical simulation: its benefit and limitation\n10. Innovation and “Technium”\n11. Climate change and agriculture in the past\n12. A role of fossil fuels\n13. “Wicked” global warming problem\n14. Group-work\n15. Summary and final report","prerequisites":"This lecture is an elective subject, and is one of the specialized subjects.\nStudents need to preview and review for an amount of time as indicated in the student guidelines of TUAT, in addition to the attendance of lecture (30 hours).","texts_and_materials":"Materials of this lecture will organized in each class according to the need.","assessment":"Performance in lecture (30%) and report assignment given by each instructor (70%)","message_from_instructor":"We hope you to roughly understand the various processes in the atmosphere.","course_keywords":"Reactive Nitrogen, Ozone, Atmospheric Chemistry, Aerosol Dynamics, Numerical Simulation, Interdisciplinary Viewpoint","office_hours":"You can ask us your question between lectures and can send e-mail for question or appointment to meet us.","remarks_1":"Nothing in particular","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/8/2022 7:18:07 PM","name":{"id":2424,"ja":"自然環境資源学特論Ⅵ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Science and Natural ResourcesⅥ"},"instructor":{"id":2619,"ja":"堅田 元喜, 未　　定, 渡辺 誠, 伊豆田 猛","en":"KATATA Genki, WATANABE Makoto, IZUTA Takeshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Nothing in particular"}}
