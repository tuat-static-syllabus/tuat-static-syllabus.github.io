The lectures aim at understanding of concepts and terms of animal ecology, such as zoogeography, evolution, social behaviour, and population. Based on the fundamental science, the lectures focus on applied components in conservation. The students must develop discussion/presentation skills of current hot topics in small groups.\n\nUNO Hiroyuki：\nThe purpose of the Ecosystem Conservation is to understand the population dynamics for large mammals, the impact of animals on their habitat, and wildlife management as one of ecosystem management. This course also aims to get the capability for explanation through a discussion.\n\n","expected_learning":"KANEKO Yayoi:\nThe lectures aim at understanding of concepts and terms of animal ecology, such as zoogeography, evolution, social behaviour, and population.
