In this lecture we describe phenomena in a mathematical forms. By solving excersices in each class, you can understand basics of modeling.We investigated some practical topics such as momentum flux and catalyst reaction with mass transfer. We have studied some practical problems related to the momentum and surface reactions of mass transfer catalysts, and so on.","expected_learning":"Understanding the foundations of mathematical modeling and learn the latest progress of the development to the fundamentals of manufacturing technology of new energy and clean energy development.","course_schedule":"1. Introduction\nEnergy engineering refers to energy outlines, concepts, types and characteristics of energy, SI unit systems.\n2. Basic Theory of Energy Engineering.\nThermodynamics and thermodynamic laws. First law and second law, energy dissipation and irreversibility, exergy, movement of thermal energy. Basic method of thermal energy transfer, chemical reaction, electromagnetism, foundation of quantum mechanics.\n3-4. Energy Resources.\nEnergy situation in the world, energy situation in Japan, origin of energy, energy resources.\n5-7. Energy Conversion.\nConversion of mechanical energy / thermal energy, (2) conversion of chemical energy / electromagnetic energy, (3) conversion of light energy, nuclear energy, biological energy.\n8.
