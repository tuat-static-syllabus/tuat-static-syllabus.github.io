The aim of this course is to experience the virtual project for research planning at an early stage.\n\nStudents will learn how to plan a new R&D project. Before the project planning thorough survey on existing R&D examples in the related fields is necessary to establish a target. Furthermore, it will elaborate the plan more feasible to extract key issues and expected problems and to find possible solutions and methodologies toward the realization of the goal. It is very important to plan a research project as an independent researcher, and such an experience is very important for students to actually perform research and development after finishing Doctor course.","expected_learning":"The standard of the course is to plan a proposal of a new research project in a field different from their own specialized field. The proposal needs to be elaborated up to a feasible project, and are finally summarized in a research planning report after presentation and discussion with reviewers.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"For this course, students determine a subject different from their own one with the aid of a professor who is not the research adviser. The course should be registered under the name of this professor. Thorough discussion with the professor for a couple of time will lead to a presentation by students, which will be reviewed by two other professors. The proposal will be finally summarized in a research planning report.","prerequisites":"This course is a compulsory subject.\nIn completing this course, students will spend at least the standard amount of time as specified by the\nUniversity following the adviser's guidance.","texts_and_materials":"Textbooks will be indicated if they are needed.","assessment":"Both oral presentation and final report will be totally considered for evaluation of the score.","message_from_instructor":"It is important to have an ability to plan R&D projects in society.
