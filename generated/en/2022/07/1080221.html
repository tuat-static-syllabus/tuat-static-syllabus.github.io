In this lecture, students will learn how to consider about chemical reaction (reaction transfer phenomena) to be handled together with transfer phenomena (momentum, heat, and movement of matter). The momentum transfer phenomenon of single-component systems (hydrodynamics) and the movement phenomena involving reactions of multicomponent systems are explained, and the analysis methods of various reaction transfer phenomena are explained. The analysis methods include theoretical analysis and numerical analysis. In numerical analysis, a program is actually created.","expected_learning":"(1) Understand basic matters regarding mass transfer\n(2) Understand how to handle steady-state mass transfer problems involving chemical reactions\n(3) Understand how to deal with the unsteady problem of mass transfer involving chemical reactions\n(4) Create a simple numerical analysis program for the unsteady problem of mass transfer involving chemical reactions\n\n4. to understand the basics of numerical analysis of multicomponent reaction transfer phenomena.\n5.
