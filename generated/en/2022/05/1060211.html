Since the structures, reactions, and functionalities of the molecules are governed by the behaviors of the electrons, it is of fundamental importance to design organic materials with your eyes set on the electronic structures. Following the relevant undergraduate courses, this course discusses methodologies for examining the electronic structures and properties of organic molecules.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to\n(1) revive their skills in microscopic physical chemistry, likely to be deteriorated during graduation research;\n(2) examine the electronic structures, stability, and reactivity of molecules with paper and a pencil;\n(3) gain a foothold for further self-study to carry out quantum chemical calculations or read through the literature of this fields.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1\nExamination to check the students' comprehension (or forgetting) of microscopic physical chemistry.\nMain scope of the examination: quantum chemistry I･II and structural chemistry.\n\nWeek 2\nReview of fundamental items, e.g., Meaning of wave function; AO energy and distribution; Hydrogenic atoms and many-electron atoms; Variation principle; LCAO approximation; Bonding and antibonding MOs; Hueckel approximation.\n\nWeek 3\nRules of orbital interaction: One-to-one (review); Two-to-one (derivation); MO construction for a heteronuclear diatomic molecule without hydrogen.\n\nWeek 4\nApplication of group theory to MO construction (review); Walsh diagram - relationship between geometric and electronic structures.\n\nWeek 5\nApplication of quantum chemistry to polymers: Energies and wave functions of polymer MOs dependent on the conformation.\n\nWeek 6\nConstruction of π electronic systems in carbonyl compounds, benzene, and heterocycles; Aromaticity; Interpretation of computer outputs of empirical calculations for fundamental molecules.\n\nWeek 7\nReactions governed by interaction between the HOMO of chemical species A and the LUMO of chemical species B; Regioselectivity and the electron distribution of the HOMO and LUMO.\n\nWeek 8\nReactions forming two bonds simultaneously between chemical species A and B: Stereoselectivity governed by orbital symmetry. Expedient separation of a molecule into two parts (an electron donor and an electron acceptor): In-phase HOMO-LUMO interaction yielding the main product.\n\nWeek 9\nRetention or inversion of stereochemistry in reactions; Orbital phase continuity conditions; Conservation of orbital symmetry; Orbital correlation diagram; Symmetry allowed and forbidden reactions.\n\nWeek 10\nExperimental methods to survey the electronic structures of organic molecules and aggregates: From the standpoint of energies and that of wave functions.\n\nWeek 11\nVariational calculation for Li using the product of three orbitals of the same type and the wrong result; Pauli principle and antisymmetrized wave function; N-electron Slater determinant.\n\nWeek 12\nExpectation value of ground-state energy Ee with the Slater determinant of an N-electron system.\n\nWeek 13\nHartree-Fock equations obtained by minimizing Ee subject to the constraint that the spinorbitals are orthonormal.\n\nWeek 14\nHartree-Fock-Roothaan equations: Hartree-Fock SCF procedure for molecular systems, in which each spatial wave function is expressed as a linear combination of basis functions; Selection of basis sets.\n\nWeek 15\nInterpretation of computer outputs of ab initio calculations; Final examination.\n","prerequisites":"Ability to earn the credits of quantum chemistry I･II and structural chemistry offered for the undergraduate students of organic and polymer materials chemistry (or similar courses) is necessary.\n\nIn addition to the time in the class, students are recommended to spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University on self-learning.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Final examination (50 %) and participation in discussion (50 %).","message_from_instructor":"It is desirable that you understand the significance and limitation of chemical models simplifying the real systems as well as intend to avoid creating black boxes as much as possible. Every student who takes this course will be often asked for an opinion in the class and is expected to cultivate the ability of scientific explanation and discussion.","course_keywords":"Orbital energy, distribution, symmetry, and interaction; Relationship between geometric and electronic structures; Chemical reactivity; Slater determinant; Hartree-Fock (-Roothaan) equation.","office_hours":"　Wednesday (School day) 18:00 - 19:00","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/4/2022 10:40:42 AM","name":{"id":1929,"ja":"有機材料構造特論Ⅰ","en":"Structures of Organic Materials I"},"instructor":{"id":1244,"ja":"尾﨑 弘行, 岡本 昭子","en":"OZAKI Hiroyuki, OKAMOTO Akiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"工学府博士前期","category":"前期課程科目","department":"","semester":"1学期","course_type":"1学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"水2","references":"Handouts will be distributed."}}
