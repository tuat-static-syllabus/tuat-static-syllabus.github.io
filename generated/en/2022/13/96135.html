None of them is identical with the previous ones.　This lecture will give some ideas on how to isolate natural compounds with the aid. But it is only schematic manual. Actual isolation and purification of natural products must not be stereotyped; it requires critical spirit, creativity and originality.","course_schedule":"① Isolation of Natural Products 　\n② Centrifugal Partition Chromatographic\n③ Supercritical Fluid Chromatography\n④ Mass Spectrometry and Metabolomics Analysis","prerequisites":"In addition to the 7.5 hours of class time and the time required for writing reports, students are required to refer to the lecture materials and reference books distributed to them, and to prepare and review according to the standard number of hours at the university.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided in class.","assessment":"Class participation attitude: 50%: Attendance and contribution to group activities (surveys, presentations) will be evaluated.\nReport：30％：A small assignment will be submitted after the lecture and will be used as a point of evaluation.\nExaminations: 20%: Evaluated by the performance of quizzes on related knowledge during the lecture.\n","message_from_instructor":"II will try to explain chemical communications in an easy-to-understand way.
