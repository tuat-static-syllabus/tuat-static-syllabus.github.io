To understand the current state of forest resources, we will learn the basics of environmental science including basic meteorology, and study about social use of wood resources. We will also learn about resource circulation and the loss of resources due to natural disasters.\n","expected_learning":"Learn the following items\n・ Basics of meteorology: Hydrothermal circulation on a global scale\n・ Basics of environmental studies: Mechanism of global warming\n・ Forest resource science: Relationship between forest growth and water resources\n・ Natural disasters: Understand the classification of sediment-related disasters caused by water, and the loss of resources.\n","course_schedule":"Class contents are mainly about the following items\n・ Westerlies and trade winds. Air mass formation and understanding of weather map\n・ Sensible heat and latent heat\n・ Social water transport\n・ The difference between artificial forests and natural forests, together with forest growth\n・ Water circulation in watershed\n・ Natural disasters and terrain formation\nIn addition, in order to understand the lesson contents, we will give a quiz about learning items, and we plan to have group discussions and presentations.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"The lecturer prepares the handout prints.
