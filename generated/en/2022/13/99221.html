Plant pathogens differ from environmental microorganisms and symobionts, in their lifestyles and strategy to invade plants. This course starts by introducing students to the importance of plant pathology and next shows how plant pathogens differ from other microorganisms. Lastly, I will talk about the importance of plant microbiota research, which has been increasingly progressed by the development of new systems called “Syncom.” This lecture will lead students to the world of recent plant pathology research, which can solve the problem of food security.\n\n＜Prof.Sugihara＞\nSoil resource management is critically important to achieving sustainable agriculture. In addition, “Carbon farming” becomes a strong keyword in the world to consider the balance of productivity and environment in the agricultural ecosystems. This lecture will talk about the recent progress in the study of Soil Carbon dynamics to manage the C sequestration into the soil.\n\n＜Prof.Suzuki＞\nMany new techniques have been utilized in the production and breeding of horticultural crops. One of them include plant tissue culture and genetic transformation techniques. In this class, I describe that basic point, problems, and future prospects about these techniques on the production and breeding of horticultural crops. Furthermore, I also describe the improvement of horticultural crops using modification of biosynthetic pathway of plant pigments such as anthocyanin and carotenoid.","expected_learning":"＜Prof.Komatsu＞\nUnderstanding how pathogenic microorganisms differ from other environmental microorganisms and symbionts.
