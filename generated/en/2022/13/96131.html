This lecture will cover (1) types and outbreaks of pests in food factories, invasion routes, (2) outbreaks, pest management methods for each invasion route, (3) development of new control systems, and (4) the verification of scientific evidence of the pest management systems in food factories.\nAnd finally I will show you the application of research findings on inter-kingdom interaction in the agricultural field.\n","expected_learning":"Explain the general types of pests in food factories, their occurrence, and the invasion route.\nExplain the pest management method for each outbreak and invasion route.\nUnderstand the approach towards developing a new pest control system.\nUnderstand the approach towards scientific verification of pest management systems in food factories.\n","course_schedule":"(1) Types of pests, outbreaks, and invasion routes in food factories\n(2) Pest management method for each outbreak and invasion route\n(3) Development of a new control system\n(4) Verification of scientific evidence of pest management system in food factories.\n\nSubmit a report on the development of a pest management system from the content of the lecture.\n\n","prerequisites":"In addition to the 7.5 hours of class time and the time required to create reports, etc., refer to the distributed lecture materials and reference books, and prepare and review according to the standard number of hours of the university.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided online","assessment":"report 100%","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Ifood safety, food factory, food insect pest, contamination, pest management system,","office_hours":"Questions will be accepted at the end of the lecture.
