The purpose of this lecture course is to acquire advanced specialized skills in the field of Department of Biological Production Science by learning latest knowledge and technology in agriculture science.\nCurrently, Japanese livestock farming relies heavily on imported feed. The low feed self-sufficiency ratio may cause an economic pressure on farmers due to increase in feed prices and an increase in environmental impact. Therefore, various efforts are being made to improve feed self-sufficiency ratio. Through such efforts, it has been recognized that the use of self-supplied feed has a useful effect not only for economic and environment, but also for nutritional physiology of livestock and quality of products. For example, the metabolism and, consequently, growth performance of beef calves can be improved by grazing. In addition, it is also reported that the feeding domestic corn and rice, which have been utilized occasionally as concentrate feed instead of imported grain feed in recent days, can improve the quality of milk and meat.\nIn this lecture, the current state of feed production, and the utilization technology to increase domestic feed production will be introduced first. Next, it is explained what influences will be exerted in dairy cows and beef cattle by the application of grazing and domestic concentrate feed from the aspects of the nutritional physiology and production performance, focusing on recent research.\n","expected_learning":"To explain the situation surrounding feed and the importance of improving feed self-sufficiency ratio.\nTo explain the effect of the grazing and self-supplied concentrate feed on physiology and production performance of ruminants.\nFor information on the relationship with Diplomacy, refer to the Curriculum Map of the General Information and Course Description.\n","course_schedule":"1.
