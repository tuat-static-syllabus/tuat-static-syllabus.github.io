This lecture will provide advanced knowledge and skills in the field of applied life sciences.\n“Lectin” is a general term for proteins or glycoproteins that recognize and bind to carbohydrates or carbohydrate chains. All organisms have a large numbers of lectins with various structures and functions. Some lectins are utilized in the biochemical and medical fields because of the specific binding to various types of cells (including cancer cells). This lecture is focused on structures, properties, functions, and utilization of lectins from plants and invertebrates.\n","expected_learning":"To understand the characteristics of the lectins and be able to explain them in Japanese and English. In addition, to understand and explain the methods for measuring the activity, physiological functions, and utilization of lectins. Please refer to the curriculum map in the course guide.","course_schedule":"1. Properties of lectins (History, assay of lectins)\n2. Structure of lectins (Primary and tertiary structures)\n3.
