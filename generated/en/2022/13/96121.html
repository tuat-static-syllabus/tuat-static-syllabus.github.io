In this section, characters of ES cell and somatic stem cells will be introduced.\n2) Initialization of somatic cells\nInduced pluripotent stem cells were established by transfection of 4 initializing factors to mouse skin fibroblasts for the first time in the world at 2006. In this section, the history of improvement of iPSC engineering and the problem will be introduced.\n3) Induction of some differentiated cells from iPSC or mesenchymal stem cells\nIn this section, induction of mesenchymal stem cell from iPSC and differentiation of tendon/muscle from mesenchymal stem cells will be introduced.\n","prerequisites":"Knowledge of molecular biology as well as mammalian histology and embryology will be needed.\n","texts_and_materials":"The lecture materials will be handed out in Google classroom as PDF files","assessment":"I'll take attendance in the beginning of the lecture.\nThe student must submit the report about regenerative medicine or related animal sciences.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"ES cell, Somatic stem cell, iPS cell, mesenchymal stem cell, tendon/muscle","office_hours":"Please contact via e-mail","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/3/2022 3:29:38 PM","name":{"id":1646,"ja":"動物形態機能学特論","en":"Advanced Animal Function and Morphology"},"instructor":{"id":962,"ja":"新井 克彦","en":"ARAI Katsuhiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Scleroprotein and Leather Research Institute","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Molecular Biology of the Cell, Alberts et al.\n"}}
