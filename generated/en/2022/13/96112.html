A deep understanding of the physiological processes of crop production is necessary to increase productivity. In this course, we will focus on photosynthesis, which is the basis of crop production, to understand its physiological and molecular mechanisms and how it is linked to the agroecosystem. We will also discuss the latest research of photosynthesis and elements necessary for the advent of the second green revolution.\n","expected_learning":"(1) To be able to explain photosynthesis and crop production.\n(2) To be able to express their own ideas about future crop development.\n\nRelationship to the Diploma Policy\nThis course corresponds to A(1), D(8) and D(9) of the DP of the United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences.\n","course_schedule":"(1) Learn about the process of crop production.\n(2) Learn the details of photosynthetic mechanism and its regulation process.\n(3) Discuss the factors necessary for future crop design.\nThe content of the class will be modified according to the progress of the class.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"English documents will be provided on the day of class.","assessment":"Positive attitude toward class participation 50%.\nAssignment submission 50%.\n","message_from_instructor":"Enjoy understanding crop production process and discussing future crop design.","course_keywords":"Photosynthesis　C4 plant　Carbon fixation　Molecular breeding　Light use efficiency","office_hours":"Questions will be accepted at the end of the lecture or by e-mail.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/1/2022 2:05:32 PM","name":{"id":1641,"ja":"植物生産生理学特論","en":"Advanced Plant Production Physiology"},"instructor":{"id":2513,"ja":"安達 俊輔","en":"ADACHI Shunsuke"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"連合農学研究科","category":"","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"集中","references":""}}
