In the history, several hundred mutants have been isolated so far. These genetic resources have been used in the field of sericulture; in addition, many genetic research has been conducted using them. In this class, insect genetics and insect physiology are discussed mainly with a silkworm, which is a model organism of lepidopteran insects. Students will be able to understand the newest research of insect physiology revealed by recent genome and gene analysis. In addition, environmental adaptation and evolution of insects based on the newest research will be also discussed.","expected_learning":"◯ Students who successfully complete this course will be able to understand the newest research of insect genetics and insect physiology.\n◯ Corresponding criteria in the Diploma policy: see the curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"This subject is an intensive course given in one day.
