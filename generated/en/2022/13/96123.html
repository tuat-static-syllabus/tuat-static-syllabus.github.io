However, recent advancement on reproductive technologies in mammals, especially in eutherian mammals, has been drastic as everybody knows on TV and in newspaper articles. We would like to introduce the advanced reproductive technologies in mammals and to discuss the problems of technology and safety.\nThis class is divided into two halves. In the first half, I explain reproductive phenomenon and new technologies during preimplantation period. In the last half, I have a lecture related with some phenomenon and new technologies during implantation and periimplantation period.\n\nIn the first half of the class: “Reproductive Technology in Mammals”\nAfter the basic knowledge on mammalian reproduction is briefly given, the advanced reproductive technologies, e.g. in vitro fertilization, embryo transfer, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, nuclear transfer and production of transgenic animals etc., are introduced. Safety and risk of the advanced reproductive technologies are also explained because some advanced reproductive technologies are using for treatments of infertile human patients as “Assisted Reproductive Technologies, ART” in the world. Although importance of cytogenetical safety in embryos derived by ART is well recognized, evaluation and investigation for risk in the ART are insufficient. It has been reported cytogenetical normality in mammalian embryos, including humans, produced by various advanced reproductive techniques.\n\nIn the last half of the class: “Successful Implantation and Pregnancy”\nImplantation involves an intricate discourse between the embryo and uterus, and is a gateway to further embryonic development. Synchronizing embryonic development until the blastocyst stage with the uterine differentiation that takes place to produce the receptive state is crucial to successful implantation and therefore to pregnancy outcome. Although implantation involves the interplay of numerous signaling molecules, the hierarchical instructions that coordinate the embryo?uterine dialogue are not well understood. This lecture highlights our knowledge about the molecular development of preimplantation, implantation, and the future challenges of the field. A better understanding of periimplantation biology could alleviate female infertility and help to develop novel contraceptives.\n\n","expected_learning":"In the first half of the class:\n“Reproductive Technology in Mammals”\n1.
