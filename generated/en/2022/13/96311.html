Forest Resource Assessment 2010 by FAO shows that the ratio of the forest area owned publicly is 80%, and the ratio changes greatly with areas, that owned by community, individual, private enterprise has increased. It has been proposed that there is a pattern of evolution ‘1)common property, 2)national possession, and 3)private property’, concerning forest ownership and management, and this pattern is significantly related to deforestation and reforestation historically. The forest policy which originally born with modern state formation in past centuries now begin to grope its way to decentralize.\nIn this lecture, the background of decentralization of forest policy, the state of the world-historic various aspects, will be discussed.\n","expected_learning":"1Comprehensive understanding of ‘decentralization’ of forest management on global time scale as a tool for sustainable forest management","course_schedule":"\n1.
