In modern life, where contact with the natural environment tends to be lost, it is necessary to reaffirm the blessings that nature brings and actively incorporate them for a healthy life. In this lecture, some biometric information will be taken up and explained as an objective index of human beings. In addition to introducing specific research examples regarding the relationship with the natural environment, students will actually measure some biological information with each other.","expected_learning":"Understanding of the benefits of the natural environment on human life.\nUnderstanding of the stress system in humans.\nBe able to explain the theoretical background through the measurement of biological information.\n","course_schedule":"We will discuss about the following :\n1) Relationship between the natural environment and human life\n2) Human emotion and stress\n3) Biological information: heart rate variability, electroencephalogram, brain oxygen dynamics, salivary amylase activity\n4) Measurements of biological information\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"You can read handouts provided before the lecture.","assessment":"We will assess based on the performance in lecture (50%) and report (50%)","message_from_instructor":"No special knowledge or skills are required.
