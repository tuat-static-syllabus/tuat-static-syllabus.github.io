Students learn the solution of the Schroedinger equation of some simple one-dimensional problems to understand the basic properties of quantum mechanics. They then learn the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics with the bra and ket notation. Finally, they learn the internal structure of the hydrogen atom.","expected_learning":"Students are expected to be able to\n1. describe the basics of quantum mechanics, such as the meaning of a wave function.\n2. solve simple one-dimensional problems of the Schroedinger equation and then explain the basic properties of quantum mechanics.\n3. understand the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.\n4. understand the internal structure of the hydrogen atom.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.
