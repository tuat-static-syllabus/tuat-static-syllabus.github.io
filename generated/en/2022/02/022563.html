This theory is applied to many areas such as electromagnetism, fluid mechanics, etc.\n\nThis course is taught by a part-time lecturer. Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.\n\nGoogle Classroom Class Code： 6e2pxkf","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n1. Understand complex functions and holomorphic functions\n2. Understand the definition and basic properties of complex integrals, and handle it with high calculation ability\n3. Understand residues, and apply it to calculate real and complex integrals.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Complex Numbers (Chapter 1.1)\nWeek 2: Series, Power Series, Complex Functions, Holomorphic Functions (Chapter 1.3, 2.1)\nWeek 3: Cauchy-Riemann Equations (Chapter 2.2)\nWeek 4: Exponential Functions (Chapter 2.3)\nWeek 5: Trigonometric, and Hyperbolic Functions (Chapter 2.3)\nWeek 6: Logarithms, n-th Root, Multivalued Functions (Chapter 2.3, 1.2)\nWeek 7: Exercises in Week 1-6\nWeek 8: Review, and Midterm Examination\nWeek 9: Complex Integrals (Chapter 3.1)\nWeek 10: Cauchy's Integral Theorem, Cauchy's Integral Formula (Chapter 3.2, 3.3)\nWeek 11: Taylor Series, Laurent Series (Chapter 4.1)\nWeek 12: Singularities, Residues (Chapter 4.2)\nWeek 13: Evaluating Real Integrals Using Complex Functions (Chapter 4.3)\nWeek 14: Exercises in Week 9-13\nWeek 15: Review, and Term Examination\n\nHomework: \"Problems\" and \"Exercises\" in the relevant part of the textbook","prerequisites":"Students entering this class are assumed to have learned Calculus I-II and Linear Algebra I-II.\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.\n","texts_and_materials":"YANO Kentaro, et al., Fukuso Kaiseki (Complex Analysis), Shokabo","assessment":"A midterm and a term examination will be given.
