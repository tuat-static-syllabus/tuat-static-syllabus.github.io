We will seamlessly move from the chemical bonds and electronic states of molecules consisting of a small number of atoms to the band theory and electronic states of macroscopic solids (consisting of an Avogadro number of atoms). This makes the connection between bonds and bands clear. The aim is to provide a basic understanding of the question of why there are metals, semiconductors and insulators.","expected_learning":"The following achievement standards are set as minimums for solid state physics.\n(1) To be able to understand and handle the concept of reciprocal lattice space and k-space.\n(2) To be able to understand and explain the chemical bonding and electronic structure of molecules consisting of a small number of atoms.\n(3) To understand the free electron model of solids, and to understand and explain thermophysical properties and electrical conduction.\n(4) To understand the lattice vibrations of solids and to understand and explain their thermophysical properties.\n(5) Understand the energy bands and explain why materials are classified as metals, semiconductors and insulators.\nPlease refer to the curriculum map in the course guide.\n","course_schedule":"1.
