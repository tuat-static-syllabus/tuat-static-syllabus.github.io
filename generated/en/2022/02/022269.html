In this course, students will learn the structure and function of various substances that make up living organisms and the reaction mechanisms for maintenance of homeostasis. The purpose of this course is to learn the basics of biochemistry as one of the foundations that support to understand the complex and diverse needs in medical fields and to solve research issues related to biomedical engineering.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n(1) Understand the structure and function of the main molecules that make up living organisms.\n(2) Understand the function and mechanisms of enzymes as catalysts for biochemical reactions.\n(3) Explain the main points of the metabolic pathway of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"[1] Life phenomena and biochemistry\n[2] Structure and function of proteins and enzymes\n[3] Mechanism of enzyme action (1): Activation and reaction of enzymes\n[4] Mechanism of enzyme action (2): Reaction kinetics\n[5] Bioenergetics\n[6] Carbohydrate Metabolism (1): Tricarboxylic acid cycle\n[7] Carbohydrate Metabolism (2): Glycolysis\n[8] Summary of the first half\n[9] Lipid Metabolism\n[10] Protein and amino acid metabolism\n[11] Structure and function of information macromolecules\n[12] Regulation of gene expression\n[13] Biochemistry of intracellular signal transduction (1): Structure and function of biological membrane\n[14] Biochemistry of intracellular signal transduction (2): Mechanism of intracellular signal transduction\n[15] Summary of the last half","prerequisites":"Students are recommended to prepare for each subject and revise the lecture, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts to be distributed in the class.","assessment":"Homework 20%, Midterm exam 40%, Final exam 40%","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Protein, Enzyme, Carbohydrate, Lipid, Metabolism, Intracellular signal","office_hours":"Ask questions after the lecture as much as possible.
