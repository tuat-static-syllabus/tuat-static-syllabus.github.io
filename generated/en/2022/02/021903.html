In this course, we will learn various computations based on matrices so that we can treat more abstract notions such as vector spaces at hand.\n\nThis course is taught by a part-time lecturer. Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.","expected_learning":"・To be able to solve simultaneous equations by using elementary transformation of matrices.\n・To be able to understand and calculate determinants of matrices.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps\n\n","course_schedule":"1.
