After my castigation I will return them in next class. You will go over the content of before class in the first of every next class. You will go over the contents of class from 1st to 8th and test about the contents in 9th class. You will review the contents of class from 10th to 15th in last class. You will be evaluated about the degree of understanding the contents of class from 1st to 15th in final examination.","expected_learning":"You will be able to understand that electrons exist not in ring but three-dimensional orbitals, chemical bond is caused by sharing of electron pair in molecular orbital, and understand concept of equilibrium, concept of oxidation and reduction, and distinguish acid and base, expect structure of molecules or ions, and appreciate characteristic of elements.","course_schedule":"1st : the intent of chemistry, quantity and unit of matter\n2nd:the Structure of Atom\n3rd:the Quantum theory, Wave Function\n4th:the orbital of electrons\n5th:the periodic table, Electronegativity, Ionizing energy, Electron affinity, Dipole\n6th: Valence Bond theory\n7th: Molecular Orbital theory\n8th: Hybrid Orbitals and Structures of Molecule, VSEPR theory\n9th:Review and test\n10th:Definition of acid and base, pH\n11th: Chemical Equilibrium\n12th:Oxdation and Reduction\n13th:Characteristic of Metal Elements\n14th: Characteristic of Nonmetal Elements\n15th:Intermolecular forces, hydrogen bond, review of all\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Basic Chemistry, Yoshito Takeuchi, Kagaku Dojin","assessment":"Final Examination (60%), Test(9th)(30%), exercise(1st~8th, 10~15th)(20%)","message_from_instructor":"You must write your name and school register number.
