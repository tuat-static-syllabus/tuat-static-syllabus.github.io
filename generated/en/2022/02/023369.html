What determines the body function is dynamic and plastic soft material inside and outside the cell, that is, a string-like macromolecular protein and its associated body. If you manage your body's soft material appropriately with your own efforts, you will live healthier in the first century and can keep chasing your dreams.This course is one of a group of general chemistry courses classified as specialized courses in the Department of Applied Chemistry.\n","expected_learning":"1) What is the difference between life chemistry and artifacts as the nucleus of organic chemistry that started from the study of the material aspects of living things? 2) What is the essence of soft material that produces its own boldness on a daily basis? 3) Elements What are the characteristics of soft materials that lead to reductive life chemistry to total life science? 4) What is the substance / cause of deterioration of soft material accompanying time progression of organisms? 5) Anti - aging characteristics and relationship between body motion and soft material. 6) Do you know the difference in design principle between people and nonhuman beings (plants, animals / birds, microorganisms etc.) and artifacts? 7) Can you explain the life science base for life sustainability and human sustainability as a member of a sustainable society?\n\nFor the curriculum policy perspective of this course, please refer to the curriculum map in the Faculty of Engineering Course Guide","course_schedule":"Google Classroom: vf2vltq\n\n(1st) Introduction to Soft Materials\n(Part 2) Bio and Soft Materials\n(3rd) Soft Material in Cell\n(4th) Artificial Soft Materials ・ Plastics and Humanity\n(5 th) Biomaterials made by soft materials\n(6 th) Soft Materials' Body, Movement, 'Output Dependence'\n(7 th) Eggshell membrane making as an example of soft material and industrial examples of the future society and aging society\n(Eighth) Eggshell membrane material as an example of soft material.
