In this course, you understand the fundamental properties of light. Firstly, you learn reflection, refraction, interference, and diffraction as shown in geometrical optics. Next, you learn polarization of light, optical fibers, and laser. Finally, you learn the interaction of light with matter in light emitting diodes (LEDs), semiconductor lasers, photodetectors, and solar cells. Through this course, you understand the nature of physical phenomena related to optical and electronic devices widely used and indispensable in our modern society.\n\nGoogle classroom code:\ntamslmz","expected_learning":"You are expected to be able to understand the fundamental physical process of light-matter interaction.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"The first half of this course lectured by G.
