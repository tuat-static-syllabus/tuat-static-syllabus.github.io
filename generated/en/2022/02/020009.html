Students will experience different styles of lectures and classes. It consists of two parts.\n\nPart I : Common Introductory Program\nIn this program that is common to all first-year students, students will learn about our university and think how they would pursue their academic life here. The university history and TUAT principals are described as well as our research activities, with the aim of encouraging students to engage in university study and to understanding the importance of designing their individual university life.\n\nPart II : Faculty-Specific Program\nCourses in high schools are designed to make science lectures separately; physics, chemistry, biology, and archeology. In Universities, interdisciplinary studies of those fields are necessary to learn science. This course is designed for you to experience topics of science by conducting experiments, which cover diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, informatics, security, and environments. You learn how to develop your specialties with broad views through performing the experiments by own thoughts.","expected_learning":"We expect you all to learn to\n(1) To understand the autonomous learning in the University, and be able to design individual's academic life at University from broad perspectives.\n(2) Understand principles of the experiments.\n(3) Appropriately conduct the experiments from comprehension of purposes and methods of the experiments.\n(4) Analyze experimental data and make reasonable conclusions.\n(5) Lead scientific discussion from the experimental results.\n(6) Write your reports of the above items.\n\nCompetency Development：\nInitiative and Autonomy, Leadership and Facilitation, Knowledge Creation, Presentation Skills, Mission-Oriented Research and Problem Solving, Academic Ethics\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Part I : Common Introductory Program\n1. About the University (I)\n　　Talks from the President, the Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, and the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering.\n2. Our Initiative for Society\n　　(First half) Global warming and emission of green house gas. Our effort in reducing CO2 emission.\n　　(Second half) TUAT Plastic 5R Campus-Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Renewable, Research. Our teaching and research activities in finding the solutions and educating future generations.\n3. Studying at the University\n　　(First half) Differences between studying at high school and studying at university. Designing your academic life at the University from broad perspectives, with a systematic approach in mind in taking lectures and studying abroad.\n　　(Second half) Identity development and academic life: Challenges experienced in adolescence.\n4. Research ethics\n　　Code of conduct for research integrity, and scientific misconducts. Falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism are discussed.\n5. Campus tour to visit the University's facilities\n　　Students visit the Nature and Science Museum of the University and other facilities.\n\n\nPart II : Faculty-Specific Program\n#6- Experiments\nNucleophilic substitution reaction for Alkyl halides\nEnvironmental analysis ~Inorganic qualitative analysis~\nFabrication of plastic cell\nThin-layer chromatography\nDNA analysis and Electrophoresis\nScientific criminal investigation ~Synthesis of fluorophore and observation of luminescence behavior~\nOxidation-reduction titration of vitamin C\nSynthesis of acetanilide\nResearch workshop\n\nSome experimental themes have been integrated and/or deleted to conduct online experimental class only for this year.","prerequisites":"Students are required to prepare for each experiment in order to take reasonable care for your safety and for all other students. You should read the textbook thoroughly to understand the contents of the experiments (5 h).\n\nAfter each experiment, the students have to write an experiment report and submit it within the due date (15 h).\nIn addition to 25 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to perform the above task using the textbook and the references specified below.\nIn completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\n\nAll students are required to join the Disaster and Accident Insurance for Students (GAKKENSAI).\nStudents may not work in the lab without complete compliance with the safety policy, which will be announced at the course guidance (1st day) in detail.","texts_and_materials":"The original textbook ed. by our department for lab courses.\n","assessment":"Standard study time set by our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows.\n\nNormal score (every time), 50%: efforts / participation in experiments, attitudes to learn, completeness of preparations for experiments, proficiency in experimental techniques will be evaluated.\nReports (containing problems related to the experiments, assignment tests), 50%: the status of submission and the completeness of reports (that is correct understanding of experimental contents, accurate reports of experimental results, and appropriate discussion about the results) will be evaluated.\n\nGrade will be given according to the following criteria: S: ≧90 points, A: 90> and ≧80 points, B: 80> and ≧70 points, C: 70> and ≧60 points.\nIf you have unexcused absences, arriving in class late, and late and/or missing reports, you may not receive a passing grade.\n\nPast grade distribution\n2020　S: 1%; A: 77%; B: 19%; C: 1%; D: 2%","message_from_instructor":"Experiment course is integrated course of science. The registered students should understand backgrounds and theories of each experiment by reading the textbook and other supplementary materials beforehand, participate in the experiments, and submit reports of the corresponding experiments.
