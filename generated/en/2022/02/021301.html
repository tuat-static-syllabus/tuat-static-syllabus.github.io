Lectures on basic statistics for the purpose of acquiring the ability to exchange. In addition, each faculty member of Applied Chemistry should have a sense of social issues, conduct research activities, understand how research results are being returned to society, etc., and motivate the significance of studying in the department. Is the purpose. For this reason, we will work on small group work incorporating elements of active learning.\n\n[Summary] This course introduces the research content of each laboratory in the department of information orientation, library orientation, and applied chemistry necessary for university life and self-learning, deepens the understanding of the department, and performs experimental data and statistical processing It consists of processing methods related to basic statistics, research work by group work, discussion and presentation. In addition, since group work is small group education, each teacher is rotated every two weeks, research is conducted based on the theme presented by the teacher, and the results are presented and discussed.","expected_learning":"Basic statistics: Understand the concepts (variation, deviation, repeatability, etc.) required for interpretation based on data.\nGroup work: Students will be able to obtain information on chemistry from Japanese and European copyrighted works, etc., and will be able to accurately convey and discuss the contents of the understanding to others.\n\nDiploma Policy Perspective of the Department: Please refer to the curriculum map of the course guide.","course_schedule":"1st to 7th: Learn the necessary concepts.\n\n8th to 15th group work\n・ Divide students into groups of about 8 students and study with teachers assigned to each group. Basically, two classes are taken as one unit, and group work with different contents is performed multiple times under different teachers.\nIn each group work, for example, based on books and research papers on chemistry, the contents are introduced and the understanding is deepened through discussions with other students.\n\n","prerequisites":"It is classified as a basic subject subject and is a required subject.\nIn addition to the lesson time, refer to the instructed materials, etc., and conduct preparations, reviews and surveys in accordance with the standard time of the University.","texts_and_materials":"Texts and materials will be announced by each instructor.","assessment":"Comprehensively evaluate from assessments in lectures and group work. The evaluation criteria will be announced in advance by a rubric. In principle, attendance at all lectures and group work is a prerequisite for grade evaluation. In lab work, the student number and name must be entered in the rubric evaluation form distributed in advance and submitted to the instructor at the first lab work. Note that if you forget this, you may not be evaluated.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"TBA","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"2/18/2022 2:20:56 PM","name":{"id":2087,"ja":"応用化学入門","en":"Introduction to Applied Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":597,"ja":"森 啓二","en":"MORI Keiji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Tue.2","references":"References will be announced by each instructor."}}
