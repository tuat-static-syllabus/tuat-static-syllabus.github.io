In this lecture, the goal is to understand the basic concept of electromagnetism and to be able to apply it to actual problems in biomedical engineering. Based on “Electromagnetism” learned in the first year, the essence of electric and magnetic phenomena including material properties will be described. In this lecture, classes and exercises will be conducted while discussing the relationship between electromagnetism and biomedical engineering.","expected_learning":"The achievement criteria are described below.\n(1) To be able to explain the physical meaning of the basic law of electromagnetics (Maxwell's equation).\n(2) To be able to explain electrostatic phenomena including conductors and dielectrics.\n(3) To be able to explain magnetostatic phenomena including magnetic materials.\n(4) To be able to describe and explain time-varying electromagnetic phenomena.\n\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"Lecture 1: Introduction: Electromagnetics and medical engineering\nLecture 2: Expressing electric and magnetic fields as vector fields\nLecture 3: Fundamental Laws of Electromagnetism I (represented by Integration of Vector Fields)\nLecture 4: Fundamental Laws of Electromagnetism II (expression by Differentiation of Vector Field)\nLecture 5: Phenomena of electrostatic field (scaler potential and dipole filed)\nLecture 6: Phenomena of electrostatic field in the presence of a conductor\nLecture 7: Phenomenon of electrostatic field in the presence of a dielectric\nLecture 8: Phenomena of static magnetic field (vector potential)\nLecture 9: Phenomenon of static magnetic field (Biot-Savart's law)\nLecture 10: Phenomenon of static magnetic field in the presence of a magnetic material\nLecture 11: Time-varying electromagnetic phenomenon (Maxwell's equations in matter)\nLecture 12: Time-varying electromagnetic phenomenon (electromagnetic induction and inductance)\nLecture 13: Time-varying electromagnetic phenomena (wave equations)\nLecture 14: Time-Varying Electromagnetic Phenomena (electromagnetic waves)\nLecture 15: Summary\n","prerequisites":"In addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Small tests and reports during lecture (50%) and a term-end exam (50%) when the exam becomes possible.
