Standard study\ntime set by the university is required to get the grade.\nThe rate of evaluation is as follows: score of the reports (30%) and the\nfinal test (70%). Grade will be given according to the following\ncriteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or\nmore and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C:\n60 or more and less than 70 points.\n","message_from_instructor":"Thermodynamics have many mathematical formulas, and seems to be difficult at first glance. However, if you deeply understand the contents, you will notice that there are not many key formulas and many formulas can be expanded from basic formulas.
