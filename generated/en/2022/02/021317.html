In this lecture, we will study the foundation of human life, which enables us to develop the will, body and mind to live well every day, from the perspective of the global environment that gave rise to life, the society in which we live in reality, the chemical substances and biological macromolecules adopted by life and the functions and interrelationships they produce, and the material foundation of adaptation that enables us to strive and learn. In addition to learning from the material basis of adaptation that enables us to strive and learn, this course includes observation of beating cardiomyocytes, practical training in extracting genomic DNA from cells, and Body-Mind Tuning in a supine position that unifies body and mind. This course is one of a group of general chemistry courses classified as specialized courses in the Department of Applied Chemistry.\n","expected_learning":"1) Do you understand the structure and function of the compounds that make up the \"cell\", the unit of life, and the material chemical basis of a moving body? 2) Do you understand the concept and design strategy of the survival system infrastructure of cells and individuals, which is the basis for the creation of life? 3) Do you understand the causes of and guidelines for preventing the deterioration of life and biomaterials (e.g., aging, fatigue, and disease, especially lifestyle-related diseases) and exhaustion? 4) Do you understand the differences in design principles between humans and non-human organisms and artifacts? As a member of a sustainable society, can you explain and practice the bio-chemical basis for life and human sustainability?\n\nPerspective of the Diploma Policy for this course: Please refer to the curriculum map in the course guide.\n","course_schedule":"Google Classroom: fnzwps7\n\nThis year's class theme: Acquiring and practicing scientific knowledge that can survive the COVID-19 pandemic and deal with the physical and mental problems of a super-aged society, based on the BODY-MIND INTEGRATIVE SCIENCE.\n\n220411 (1st session)\nLife Chemistry for Planning and Implementing COVID-19 Countermeasures from BODY-MIND INTEGRATIVE SCIENCE 1)\n\n220418 (2nd)\nLife Chemistry for Developing and Implementing COVID-19 Countermeasures from BODY-MIND INTEGRATIVE SCIENCE (2)\n\n220425 (3rd)\nBiochemistry for establishing and implementing COVID-19 countermeasures from BODY-MIND INTEGRATIVE SCIENCE (3)\nExplanation of assignment 1) Body-Mind Tuning in a supine position (4/26-5/9, Google form input every day)\n\n220522 (4th)\nLife Chemistry and BODY-MIND INTEGRATIVE SCIENCE: Brain, Mind, Life, and Body (Introduction)\n\n220509 (5th)\nAdaptation and BODY-MIND INTEGRATIVE SCIENCE: brain/mind/body/cell: two stress response fundamentals (overview)\n\n220516 (6th)\nAdvanced Biochemistry I\n\n220523 (7th)\nAdvanced Life Chemistry II Lecture\n\n220530(8th）Biochemistry I (practical training)Cells are alive\n\n220606 (9th) Advanced Life Chemistry III Lecture\n\n220613(10th) Advanced Life Chemistry IV: Individual presentations (PowerPoint presentation: 1 minute for all)\n\n220620 (11th) Advanced BODY-MIND INTEGRATIVE SCIENCE I (Basic)\n\n220627 (12th) Advanced BODY-MIND INTEGRATIVE SCIENCE II\n\n220704 (13th) Advanced BODY-MIND INTEGRATIVE SCIENCE III\n\n220711 (14th) Advanced BODY-MIND INTEGRATIVE SCIENCE IV\n\n220718 (15th) Summary: All students are required to make and submit a PowerPoint presentation.\n\nAssignment: Post-submission summary report assignment (Word file)\n","prerequisites":"Related topics: life science, polymer chemistry, liberal arts, systems theory, social industry and sustainable human science\nIn addition to 15 hours of class time, students are required to prepare and review according to the standard hours of the university.\n","texts_and_materials":"Text: Yoriko Atomi, Increase cell power~ Extend your healthy lifespan from Cell to Body & Mind Integrative Science (Ronso sha, 2018)ISBN-13: 978-4846016746","assessment":"The overall evaluation will be based on the following: the quality of the small assignments given each time during the class (30%), the quality of the records of Body-Mind Tuning in a supine position and awareness during the two weeks between the 3rd and 4th sessions (4/26-5/9) (presented in the 3rd session and entered into Google form every day) (30%), the quality of the PowerPoint presentation assignments submitted in the 10th and 15th sessions (20%), and the quality of the final report (20%).
