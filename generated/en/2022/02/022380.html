You will not be able to master the fundamentals for organic chemistry by simply attending the lectures. It is essential to solve the problems by yourself for deep understanding of organic chemistry. In this course, therefore, you will be required to solve the problems from the textbooks (Paula Y. Bruice, Organic Chemistry) used in the Organic Chemistry I, II, and III.\nExams will be given every week according to the course schedule announced in the course guidance. What each exam covers will also be given in the schedule. The problems in the exam will be assigned from the text for each chapter and/or will be similar to those found in the text.\nThe course format consists of 1) reviewing the scheduled chapters, 2) exams for the corresponding chapters, and 3) explanation of how to solve the problems.\n\nGoogle Classroom code N/A","expected_learning":"Objective of this course is to gain a solid understanding of basic organic chemistry by solving problems. The students will be able to explain various phenomena regarding organic chemistry or reactions based on your acquired knowledge.\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.\n","course_schedule":"Week 1: Course Guidance\n\nWeek 2: Electronic Structure, Bonding, and Acids and Bases (Chapters 1 and 2): Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure (Atomic Orbitals, Electron Configuration， Covalent Bonding and Its Presentation by Valence Bond and Molecular Orbital Methods, Hybridization and Molecular Structure), Polar Bonding (Dipole Moment and Formal Charge), etc. are involved. Definition of Acid and Base, Acid-Base Dissociation Equilibriums and Its pka vales, Structural Factors Determining Strength of Acids and Bases, etc. are also involved.\n\nWeek 3: Nomenclature, Physical Properties, and Representation of Structure of Basic Organic Compound (Chapter 3): Nomenclature of Basic Organic Compounds such as Alkanes and Cycloalkanes, Their Physical Properties, and Conformations are involved.\n\nWeek 4: Nomenclature and Stereoisomers (Chapter 4): Nomenclature of Basic Organic Compounds such as Alkanes and Cycloalkanes, Their Physical Properties, Representation of Structures, and Stereochemistry, etc. are involved.\n\nWeek 5: Alkenes and Their Reactions (Chapters 5 and 6): Structures, Nomenclature, Basic Reactivities, Thermodynamics, and Kinetics, and Stereochemistry for Addition Reactions of Alkenes, etc. are involved.\n\nWeek 6: Reactions of Alkynes (Chapter 7) and Delocalized Electrons and Their Effect on Stability, Reactivity, and pKa (Chapter 8)\n\nWeek 7: Substitutions and Eliminations of Alkyl Halides (Chapters 9 and 10): Substitutions (SN1and SN2) and Eliminations (E1 and E2) of Alkyl Halides, etc. are involved.\n\nWeek 8: Comprehensive Exercise for week 1-7\n\nMid-term Exam\n\nWeek 9: Reactions of Alcohols, Amines, Ethers, Epoxides, and Sulfur-containing Compounds (Chapter 11) and Chemistry of Benzene: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Chapter 16): Nucleophilic Substitutions of Alcohols and Ethers, and Eliminations and Oxidations of Alcohols, and Reactions of Amines Thiols, Sulfides, and Sulfonium Salts are involved.\n\nWeek 10: Organometallic Compounds (Chapter 12) and Radical Reactions (Chapter 13): Preparation of Organometallic Compounds, Cross-coupling Reactions, and Metathesis Reactions are involved. Stability of Radicals and Related Reactions, etc. are also included.\n\nWeek 11: Carbonyl Compounds (Carboxylic Acid Derivatives, Aldehydes, and Ketones) (Chapters 16 and 17): Nomenclature of Aldehydes, Ketones, and Carboxylic Acid Derivatives such as Acid Chlorides, Anhydrides, Esters, and Amides, and Their Preparations and Reactions (Nucleophilic Acyl Substitutions, Nucleophilic Additions, and Wittig Reaction, etc.) are involved.\n\nWeek 12: Carbonyl Alpha-Substitution Reactions (Chapter 18): Carbonyl Alpha-Substitution Reactions (Formation of Enolates, Their Alkylations and Halogenation etc.) and Condensation of Carbonyl Compounds (Aldol Reaction, Claisen Condensation, Michael Reaction, etc.) are involved.\n\nWeek 13: Aromatic Compounds (Chapter 19): Chemistry of Benzene and Related Aromatic Compounds (Aromaticity, Huckel Rule, Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution Reactions, etc.) are involved.\n\nWeek 14: Amines (Chapter 20): Reactions are Nomenclature, Preparation, Properties, and Reactions are involved.\n\nWeek 15: Comprehensive Exercise for Week 9-14\n\nEnd-term Exam\n","prerequisites":"In the exercise, what each exam covers will be given in the schedule. For that reason, it is necessary to read the corresponding part of the text and to prepare such as solving the chapter problem (12 hours).\nAfter completion of the class, each person checks the answer, the wrong part is reconfirmed against the text, the corresponding answers, the commentary on the lesson etc. (3 hours).\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to perform the above task using the textbook and the references specified below.\nIn completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\n","texts_and_materials":"Organic Chemistry (7th edition), Paula Y. Bruice, Pearson (2013)","assessment":"The grade evaluation is premised on all attendances, and comprehensively evaluates the attitude to learn, weekly exams, and mid and end-term exams. Standard study time set by our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows.\n\nNormal score (every time), 50%: efforts / participation in each exercise, attitudes to learn.\nExercise Points, 50%: the degree of acquisition of basic knowledge of organic chemistry is evaluated through weekly exams and mid- and end-term exams. The ability to answer problems about organic chemistry by applying the basic knowledge is also estimated.\n\nGrade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points.\n\nPast grade distribution\n2021 　S: 2%; A: 84%; B: 8%; C: 1%; D: 5%","message_from_instructor":"The scope of each exam will be announced in the course guidance.
