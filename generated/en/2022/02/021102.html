As a universal education subject, this lecture focuses on the concept of chemical bonds, the structure of atoms, atomic orbitals, and molecular orbitals, and the concept of unifying the molecular structure, three-dimensional structure, physical properties, and reactivity of various molecules.\n<Overview>\nStudents will learn about the concept of atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals, the mechanism of chemical bonds formation, their correlation with physical properties, and their reactivity based on the textbooks. In each class, exercises will be conducted to help understanding the class. The exercises at the end of the chapter should be useful for own review. The technical terms will be present in both Japanese and English.\nAll students MUST sign up the google classroom (u4vhkf5).","expected_learning":"To understand atomic orbitals, valence bond theory, molecular orbital theory.\nTo obtain an ability to discuss the relationships between the molecular structures and their physicochemical properties from the viewpoints of molecular orbital theory.\n","course_schedule":"Course schedule: Chapter 1-5 in Organic Chemistry by Wade 7th edition.\n1：Orientation\n2：Atomic Structures\n3：Chemical bonds\n4：Molecular representations\n5：Acid-base reactions\n6：Atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals（１）\n7：Atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals（２）\n8: Summary of 1-7,\n9：Physicochemical properties of organic compounds\n10：Structures of organic compounds\n11：Conformations of organic compounds（１）\n12：Conformations of organic compounds（２）\n13：Chemical reaction（１）\n14：Chemical reaction（２）\n15：The final exam：covers materials in session 1-14\n\nSome lectures may be held in online. In this case, all students will receive the announcement before the lecture.\nEach homework should be submitted from Google class room (u4vhkf5) as a pdf file.","prerequisites":"This course will be a base for students to study the following higher level courses such as Bioorganic ChemistryI and II, Medicinal Chemistry, Biochemistry I and II, Bioanalytical Chemistry and Bioinorganic Chemistry.","texts_and_materials":"Organic Chemistry 7th Ed.

Life phenomena can be understood by chemical reactions. Chemistry is a fundamental subject in studying biotechnology. The students are assumed to have knowledge of high school chemistry. The students are supposed to review by themselves after each class, and the end-of-chapter problems should help to understand. Learning the concept of \"chemistry\", students will be able to enjoy and notice the beautiful life phenomena. Please do your best.","course_keywords":"Atoms, molecules, compounds, atomic orbitals, molecular orbitals, chemical bonds, molecular structures, structures of organic compounds, acids and bases, stereoisomers","office_hours":"17:00~ on Mondays","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/12/2022 1:03:58 PM","name":{"id":508,"ja":"化学基礎","en":"Basic Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":1953,"ja":"寺 正行","en":"TERA Masayuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Mon.3","references":"Solution Manural for Organic Chemistry 7th Ed.
