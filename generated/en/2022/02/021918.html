More specifically, we will first learn basic properties of vector spaces and their bases. Then, we will also introduce the definition of linear maps and observe the relation between linear maps and matrices. In particular, the properties of a change of basis will be investigated. Finally, we will learn about eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices and their applications.\n\nThis course is taught by a part-time lecturer. Once the employment of the part-time lecturer is confirmed, this syllabus may be modified. In this case, the official version is the modified syllabus.","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is to be capable of:\n(1) constructing a basis of a given vector space,\n(2) calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square matrices of order 3,\n(3) performing diagonalization of square matrices.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Google Classroom will be used for quizzes and assignments in each week.\n\n[Google Classroom Code]\n\n\n1. Vector spaces and their subspaces (pp.63-66)\n2. Linear independence and linear dependence (pp.68-73)\n3. On the maximum number of linearly independent vectors in a vector space (pp.75-79)\n4. Bases and dimensions of vector spaces, the linear span of a set of vectors (pp.81-85)\n5. Linear maps (p.87, p.91)\n6-7. Representation matrices of linear maps (pp.92-96)\n8. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors (pp.98-104)\n9-10. Diagonalization of square matrices I (pp.106-110)\n11. Inner products, orthogonal systems and orthogonal matrices (pp.112-121 except for Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization)\n12. Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization, complex inner products (pp.116-117, p.121)\n13-14. Diagonalization of real symmetric matrices (pp.121-126)\n15. Review, and Term examination","prerequisites":"Knowledge of the course of Linear Algebra I will be used in the lecture.\nIn addition to 30 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the lectures, spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University and using the lecture handouts as well as the references specified below.\n","texts_and_materials":"The same textbook as in Linear Algebra I is used.\n","assessment":"The term examination, 70%;\nQuizzes in Google Classroom, 10%;\nAssignments in Google Classroom, 20%","message_from_instructor":"Some topics introduced in this course may seem abstract and difficult to understand at first. However, in fact, they are closely linked with the topics which we learned in Linear Algebra I. Concrete examples in the lecture or in the textbook will help to improve your comprehension.","course_keywords":"Vector space, Linear map, Basis, Dimension, Eigenvalue, Eigenvector, Diagonalization, Orthogonal matrix","office_hours":"It will be announced in the first lecture.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/19/2022 11:06:34 AM","name":{"id":306,"ja":"線形代数学Ⅱ","en":"Linear Algebra Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":302,"ja":"與口 卓志","en":"YOGUCHI Takashi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"農学府","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"金2","references":"Masayasu Murakami et al., “Enshuu Senkei-Daisuu”, Baifu-kan (in Japanese),\nNoburou Ishii et al., “Rikou-kei Sin-Katei Senkei-Daisuu”, Baifu-kan (in Japanese)\n"}}
