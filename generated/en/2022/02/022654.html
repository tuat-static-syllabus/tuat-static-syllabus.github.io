In addition, the lecture will adopt a quantitative analysis method in order to realize the problems and develop accurate judgment. Now, the international community is making efforts in various fields beyond industry, government, and academia to achieve the \"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\". Among the SDGs, environment-related items are of particular importance, including air, climate change, marine conservation, water and sanitation, and energy. No matter what field you go to after you go on to a specialized course or even after graduating from university, you will face any challenges relating to the SDGs. The way of thinking in chemistry will surely be useful as a tool for problem solving at that time.\nThis lecture will proceed in the flipped classroom format of Active Learning. It is essential to prepare for the assignments and materials to be distributed in advance each time. This lecture also emphasizes the connection from high school chemistry to university basic chemistry and helps you to deepen your understanding of chemistry. For acid-base reactions and reaction rates, this lecture will conduct virtual experiments using Excel to understand the essence of the contents.\n","expected_learning":"It is possible to quantitatively explain the mechanisms of air pollution, ozone layer depletion, global warming, water pollution and acid rain, and their countermeasures from a chemical perspective. Diploma Policy Perspective for this course: Please refer to the curriculum map of the course guide.","course_schedule":"1.
