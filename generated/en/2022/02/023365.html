Organometallic chemistry is a hybrid of organic and inorganic chemistry and is also a frontier. Therefore, a systematic understanding based on knowledge of organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry is desired. The position within the specialized subject is an elementary understanding of chemistry, which is the boundary region between organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry and catalytic chemistry.\n\n[Outline] In this lecture, the definition of organometallic compounds, structural features, elementary reactions, basic catalytic reactions and recent catalytic reactions will be taught. Regarding catalytic reactions using organometallic compounds, several examples were given in \"Organic Chemistry III\", but only examples were introduced. In order to deepen the understanding of the catalytic reaction in this lecture, the lecture will be advanced step by step so that it can be correctly understood that the catalytic reaction is composed of combinations of elementary reactions caused by organometallic compounds.","expected_learning":"Understand the nature and elementary reactions of organometallic compounds and understand that catalytic reactions are built by combining elementary reactions. Understand the catalytic reactions of organometallic compounds used in general organic synthetic chemistry.\n\nPlease refer to the curriculum map in the course guide for the curriculum policy of this course.","course_schedule":"Organometallic chemistry and molecular catalysis are one of the modern leading fields both in inorganic and organic chemistries. In this class, the fundamental chemistry in these developing fields will be prelected.\n\nLecture 1: opening talk: introduction\nLecture 2: what is the organometallic compounds\nLecture 3: features of ligands\nLecture 4: synthesis of organometallic compounds\nLecture 5: basic reactions by organometallic compounds\nLecture 6: homogeneous hydrogenation\nLecture 7: hydrosilylations/borylation/carbonylation\nLecture 8: mid term exam\nLecture 9: functionalization of alkenes\nLecture 10: allylation reactions\nLecture 11: olefin metathesis reactions\nLecture 12: cross coupling reactions\nLecture 13: catalytic C-H bond activation\nLecture 14: recent topics\nLecture 15: Comprehensive summary\nfinal exam.","prerequisites":"Organic chemistry I, II, III and IV, inorganic chemistry I and II are taken. Students who have not taken these courses will be allowed to take the course, but the lecture will proceed on the premise that they know the content of the course. For this reason, reviewing these lectures is also important and requires four hours of study every week for preparation, lectures, homework, assignment reports, review, etc.","texts_and_materials":"Organometallic Chemistry by Fumitoshi Kakiuchi, Kyoritsu Publlishers, ISBN 978-4-320-04411-1.

However, knowledge of both organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry is indispensable for a perfect understanding, and it is difficult to master organometallic compounds without basic knowledge. A good understanding of this area will surely help in the future.","course_keywords":"Organometallic Compounds, Molecular Catalyses","office_hours":"Monday.12:00-13:00.
