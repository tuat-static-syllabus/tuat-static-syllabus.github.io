Programming is basic skill for today's researchers and engineers. In this lecture, students learn C language which is generally used for computer simulations and controls of experimental systems. Recently, Python language is rapidly becoming very popular because it is used as the standard language for AI programming. This lecture also teaches Python language.\nclass code: xi5tenv\nclass code: pfkucbg","expected_learning":"Students should be able to make fundamental programs by their own.\nSee the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"1.
