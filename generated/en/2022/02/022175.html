Until about 300 million years ago, living organisms finally started their life on the land. In the 90% of the evolutionary history of life, organisms were living in the ocean, which makes the ocean as such good biological and biogenetic resources. Various marine biotechnologies have been developed by the application of marine organisms. In this course, the students will learn the origination of life in the ocean and the energy acquisition strategy used by the marine organisms, which will then help them to understand the production of pharmaceuticals, chemical products, and biofuel from marine organisms, as well as the marine environmental protection technologies.\n\nClass code in Google classroom: eodapw3","expected_learning":"By the end of the course, the students should understand and be able to primarily explain the following issues:\n1) origination of living organism in the ocean and their energy metabolism\n2) energy acquisition strategy of marine microorganisms\n3) role of the marine organisms in the marine system\n4) production of useful compounds from marine biogenetic resource","course_schedule":"Lesson 1/Unit 1/1 Objectives of this course\nLesson 2/Unit 2/2 Evolutionary history of life from the ocean: origination of life\nLesson 3/Unit 3/3 Evolutionary history of life from the ocean: biological diversity 1\nLesson 4/Unit 4/4 Evolutionary history of life from the ocean: biological diversity 2\nLesson 5/Unit 5/5 Marine carbon and nitrate cycles and the involvement of the living organisms\nLesson 6/Unit 6/6 Marine biological resources and useful compounds production\nLesson 7/Unit 7/7 Unculturable microbes and marine metagenome\nLesson 8/Unit 8/8 Biofouling in the marine environment and its prevention\nLesson 9/Unit 9/9 Mineral formation by microorganisms and the technological application\nLesson 10/Unit 10/10 Microorganisms in extreme environment and the technological application","prerequisites":"The students should have already completed the basic molecular biology and molecular biology 1 & 2.","texts_and_materials":"Prints of the course content","assessment":"The students will be evaluated by their performances on reports, and presentations.","message_from_instructor":"Good interaction between the teacher and students is expected.","course_keywords":"Origin of life, biogenetic resource, Convention on biological diversity, production of useful compounds (pharmaceuticals, chemical products, and biofuel) from marine organisms, marine metagenome, marine environmental protection","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"Class code in Google classroom: eodapw3","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/4/2022 12:39:21 PM","name":{"id":729,"ja":"マリンバイオテクノロジー","en":"Marine Biotechnology"},"instructor":{"id":471,"ja":"田中 剛","en":"TANAKA Tsuyoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"3rd","course_type":"3rd","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Tue.3","references":""}}
