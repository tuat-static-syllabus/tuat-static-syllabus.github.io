In the research report, the students will discuss their current research progresses and future plans with the lab members. In the paper introduction, the students will introduce the most recent research papers closely related to their research themes.\nKuroda Laboratory: This class consists of three types of lab activities: 1) Lab seminar: students will present their researches and discuss the results with lab members. 2) Paper presentation: students will present and critically discuss the content of a paper closely related to their researches. 3) Journal club: students will select and very briefly introduce recent papers that are either closely related to research carried out in the lab or of general interest in the field of biotechnology.\nTsugawa Laboratory: The students will read and share with laboratory members the world's most advanced and high-impact papers, including four keywords (not all): biology, metabolism, mass spectrometry, and information science. A sharing way is to become a reviewer mind and report firmly to the lab members with constructive and critical comments. Another sharing way and to share the latest information concisely and briefly.\nIkebukuro, Tsugawa and Asano Laboratory: The students will be trained to read the latest research papers in the field of biotechnology, summary the major contents of the papers, and make a clearly understandable presentation on the summarized papers without misunderstanding.\nInada Laboratory: The students will introduce the most recent English scientific papers weekly to improve their understanding and discussion on scientific papers. The students will also report their research progresses and future plans weekly to the lab member.\nOhta Laboratory: The students will read the English scientific papers to improve their understanding on the most recent researches. The students will also discuss their research results with the lab members to obtain the scientific way of thinking.\nYamada Laboratory: The students should review the most recent scientific papers related to plant pigment biosynthesis system, transcription modulating factor, transposon, and the mechanism of environmental stress tolerance.\nNakazawa Laboratory: The students should introduce the most recent scientific papers related to the researches on silk and NMR.\nKawano Laboratory: The students should read and understand the most recent scientific research papers and make a clearly understandable presentation on the content of the papers.\nMori Laboratory: A data review meeting and the introduction of the latest papers will be introduced. At the data review meeting, the results of the experiments obtained within the given period will be summarized, presented and discussed. At the introduction of the latest papers, information is exchanged on the introduction of the latest research focusing on microorganisms.\n\n","prerequisites":"The student must be the member of corresponding laboratory.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Class Participation 100％\n(The students will be evaluated by the attendance, presentation and performance on discussion.)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/11/2022 10:20:54 AM","name":{"id":865,"ja":"生体機能工学実験Ⅱ","en":"Experiments on Bio-Functional Engineering Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":680,"ja":"一川 尚広","en":"ICHIKAWA Takahiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":10,"min":4,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目","department":"","semester":"3学期","course_type":"3学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"応用昆虫学研究室","day_period":"卒研・卒論","references":""}}
