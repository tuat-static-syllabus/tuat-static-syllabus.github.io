In continuum mechanics, such a deformation is modeled under the assumption of a continuum where the matter in the body is continuously distributed and fills the entire region of space it occupies. On the basis of the universal formulation of continuum mechanics, the dynamics specific to solids and fluids are modeled.","expected_learning":"Understand how to describe motion, deformation and forces in a continuum;\nUnderstand how to derive equations of motion and conservation laws for a continuum;\nUnderstand constitutive models for fluids and solids;\nBe able to solve simple boundary value problems for fluids and solids;\nBe familiar with applied mathmathics related to continuum mechanics, e.g. vector and tensor manipulations in Cartesian and curvilinear coordinate systems, partial differential equations, and complex analysis.\n","course_schedule":"The actual schedule will be announced on Google classroom.\n\nWeek 1: Introduction What is a continuum ?:\nWeek 2: Motion and deformation of continuum\nWeek 3: Tensors\nWeek 4: Elasticity\nWeek 5: Viscosity\nWeek 6: Governing equations for solids: Derivation of constitutive equations for linear isotropic elastic bodies\nWeek 7: Problems on solid mechanics (1)\nWeek 8: Problems on solid mechanics (2)\nWeek 9: Problems on solid mechanics (3)\nWeek 10: Mid-term examination and commentary for the contents of the weeks 1,3,4,6,7,8 and 9\nWeek 11: Governing equations for fluids: Conservation laws and Navier-Stokes equation for a Newtonian fluid\nWeek 12: Problems on fluid mechanics (1)\nWeek 13: Problems on fluid mechanics (2)\nWeek 14: Problems on fluid mechanics (3)\nWeek 15: End-term examination and commentary for the contents of the week 1,2,5,11,12,13,and 14","prerequisites":"None","texts_and_materials":"O.
