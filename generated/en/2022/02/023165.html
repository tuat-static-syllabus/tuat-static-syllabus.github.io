Various know-how is necessary to scale up laboratory experiments and to establish production technology at the industrial level. It is the main objective of this lecture to give basic knowledge on bioengineering as the foundation. The content of the lecture ranges from microbial characteristics to fluid dynamics, but by explaining examples, explain so that the actual industrial linkage can be understood.\n\nClass code: ji6pnxq\n","expected_learning":"1. Learn the basics of biochemical engineering (quantity theory, kinetics, immobilized enzyme, bioreactor).\n2. Build the foundation to know and understand the cutting-edge information on bioprocesses.\n3.
