In this class, we learn the issues of ethics about bio-technology with case studies and the ethic attitude that engineers should have systematically.　This is a lesson subject by a faculty member who has practical experience while playing an active part in the advanced research field. The theme in the first half of this lecture (1ｓｔ to 7th class) will be “Environmental Safety”, which consists of the meaning of environmental safety, environmental safety management in organizations, waste management as a specific subject of environmental safety, risks in research and development, and risk management that researchers should aim for. In the second half of this lecture, the special topic lectures on “Intellectual Property and Bioethics,” “Ownership of Human Materials” and “Biobank and Its Ethical Issues” will be held.","expected_learning":"(1) To understand the ethics that engineers should have systematically\n(2) To acquire ability to extract the issue of ethics to be inherent from the examples that occurred in the past\n(3) To learn the technique to advance the research and development of chemistry, biotechnology and information processing field based on the engineer ethics\n(4) To acquire basic knowledge of “Intellectual Property and Bioethics,” “Ownership of Human Materials” and “Biobank and Its Ethical Issues” and to express his/her own idea.\n(5) To correctly understand the importance of environmental safety in research and the risks involved in research and development.\n(6) To acquire the skills to be an engineer who can balance research promotion with independent risk management.\n","course_schedule":"1.

In order to carry out research safely without stagnating research activities, it is essential for those involved in research to have an attitude of voluntary risk management. Through this lecture, participants are expected to acquire the independent risk management skills required of engineers and researchers.","course_keywords":"Ethics, engineering ethics, bioethics, research ethics, ethics, accountability, applied ethics, Safety, Environmental safety, Risks, Accident cases, Voluntary risk management","office_hours":"※ To contact Yoshito Oshima, please send an e-mail to oshima@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp ※ To contact Koichi Sumikura, please send an e-mail to sumikura@grips.ac.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"大島：http://www.oshimalab.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ 隅藏：https://gist.grips.ac.jp/faculty/sumikura.html","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"1/27/2022 12:54:06 PM","name":{"id":2345,"ja":"生命倫理・安全管理","en":"Bioethics and Safety Management"},"instructor":{"id":2573,"ja":"隅蔵 康一, 大島 義人","en":""},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Mon.1","references":"none"}}
