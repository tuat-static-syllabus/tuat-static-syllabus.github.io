The google classcode is 36e3vfk.\n\n[Purpose] Organic chemistry is a discipline that manipulates and creates molecules. Therefore, it is important to know the molecule and understand \"the feeling of the molecules\". In this lecture, mainly focusing on “reactions”, those who learn organic chemistry should know at least “reactions with organometallic compounds”, “radical reactions”, “reactions with carbonyl compounds” and “reactions of aromatic compounds”. The purpose is to acquire knowledge of “reaction”.\n\n[Summary] \"Organic metal compounds\" involves the cross coupling reaction, Mizorogi Heck reaction, and alkene metathesis reaction, which have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In \"Radical / Alkane Reaction\", learn how radicals are generated, their properties, reactivity and their applications. In \"Reaction of carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid derivative\", you will learn about acidity of carboxylic acid, acyl substitution reaction and synthesis and reaction of carboxylic acid derivative. In “Reaction of Aldehyde and Ketone, Carboxylic Acid Derivatives and Other Reactions, Reaction of α and β Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds,” students learn nucleophilic addition reactions including metal compound reactions, reduction reactions, Wittig reactions, and so on. “Reaction of α carbon of carbonyl compound” learns α substitution reaction and various condensation reactions starting from enolate. \"In the reaction of benzene and substituted benzene,\" learn Friedel-Crafts reaction, aromatic electrophilic substitution reaction, orientation, etc. We will explain important matters by “chalk talk” together with “textbook” and “PowerPoint”. In addition, since the scope of teaching is wide, self-study that is at least as long as class hours is required. If you do not prepare in advance, there is a risk that you will not be able to learn about the lecture. We conduct homework every time to measure the degree of understanding in preparation.","expected_learning":"Understand and explain the reactivity of basic organometallic compounds that are frequently used in organic chemistry. Explain the characteristics of radical reactivity, explain the properties of carbonyl compounds, the substitution reactions and condensation reactions found in these compounds, and the reaction mechanism. A thorough understanding of the properties, reactions, and orientation of aromatic compounds, and the ability to predict reactions. In addition, from the products in these ranges, starting materials that can be used as raw materials for synthesis can be predicted, and the reaction route can be explained.\n\nFor the curriculum policy perspective of this course, please refer to the curriculum map in the Faculty of Engineering Course Guide.","course_schedule":"[1st] \"Organometallic compounds\"\nOrganic typical metal compounds, cross-coupling reactions, Mizorogi Heck reaction, alkene metathesis (Chapter 12 of textbooks)\n\n[2nd] \"Reaction of radicals and alkanes\"\nAlkyl halogen compounds, radical stability, radical reactivity, stereochemistry of radical substitution and radical addition, radical substitution of benzylic and allylic hydrogens (textbook chapter 13)\n\n[3rd] \"Reaction of carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid derivative (1)\"\nNaming of carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid derivatives, structure and physical properties, comparison of reactivity and reactivity, generality of nucleophilic addition-elimination (textbook chapter 16)\n\n[4th] \"Reaction of carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid derivative (Part 2)\"\nReaction of acyl chloride, reaction of ester, hydrolysis and transesterification of ester, nucleophilic addition and elimination (textbook Chapter 16)\n\n[5th] \"Reaction of carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid derivative (3)\"\nCarboxylic acid, amide, nitrile, acid anhydride, dicarboxylic acid (textbook Chapter 16)\n\n[6th] \"Interim test\"\nScope of questions: Textbooks Chapter 12, Chapter 13, Chapter 16\n\n[7th] \"Reaction of aldehyde and ketone, carboxylic acid derivatives and other reactions, reaction of α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (Part 1)\"\nAldehyde, ketone nomenclature, carbonyl compound reactivity comparison, Grignard reagent reaction, carbonyl compound and acetylide reaction, cyanide ion reaction, hydride ion reaction, reduction reaction (textbook chapter 17)\n\n[8th] Reactions of aldehydes and ketones ・ Carboxylic acid derivatives and other reactions ・ Reactions of α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (Part 2)\nReaction with amine, reaction with water, reaction with alcohol, protecting group, Wittig reaction, reaction of a, b-unsaturated carbonyl compound (Chapter 17 of textbook)\n\n[9th] \"Reaction of α-carbon of carbonyl compounds (1)\"\nAlpha hydrogen acidity, tautomerism, halogenation, HVZ reaction (textbook Chapter 18)\n\n[10th] \"Reaction of α-carbon of carbonyl compounds (2)\"\nEnolate, alkylation of α-carbon, Michael reaction, addition of aldol (Chapter 18 of textbook)\n\n[11th] \"Reaction of α-carbon of carbonyl compounds (3)\"\nClaisen condensation, intramolecular condensation, Robinson cyclization, malonate synthesis, acetoacetate synthesis, biological reactions (textbook chapter 18)\n\n[12th] \"Reaction of benzene and substituted benzene (1)\"\nNomenclature of benzene derivatives, aromatic electrophilic substitution, halogenation, nitration, sulfonation (Chapter 19 of textbooks)\n\n[13] \"Reaction of benzene and substituted benzene (2)\"\nFriedel-Crafts reaction, cross-coupling reaction, substituent conversion reaction on benzene ring, polysubstituted benzene (textbook Chapter 19)\n\n[14th] \"Reaction of benzene and substituted benzene (3)\"\nSubstituent effect, orientation, pKa and substituent, synthesis of trisubstituted benzene, synthesis using diazonium salt, aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction (textbook Chapter 19)\n\n[15th] Comprehensive summary\n\"Final exam\"\nScope of questions: Textbooks 17-19\n\n","prerequisites":"Since it is one of the organic chemistry subjects grouped into specialized basic subjects in the Department of Applied Chemistry, sufficient knowledge about \"Organic Chemistry I\" and \"Organic Chemistry II\" is required.

Standard study time set by the our university is required to get the grade. The rate of evaluation is as follows: Normal score: 20%, intermediate exam: 30%, and final test: 50%. Grade will be given according to the following criteria by comprehensive evaluation: S: 90 points or more, A: 80 or more and less than 90 points, B: 70 or more and less than 80 points, C: 60 or more and less than 70 points. The final grade will be made by apportioning with the grade assigned by Prof. Nakano.","message_from_instructor":"Organic chemistry is not a memorized subject. What is needed to understand organic chemistry is summarized in just three elements. That is, “1: the polarization is uniquely determined by the electronegativity of the element”, “2: the bond is formed by two electrons” and “3: the reaction includes a radical reaction, an ionic reaction, and a concert. There are only three types of reactions. \" Knowing these principles and knowing the feelings of molecules can lead to correct results even for reactions that you encounter for the first time. These perfect understandings will become a lifetime asset.\n\nL'essential est invisible pour les yeux.\n(The important thing is invisible: Antoine de Saint-Exupery)","course_keywords":"Organometallic chemistry necessary for organic chemistry, properties and reactions of radicals, properties and reactions of carbonyl compounds, properties and reactions of aromatics","office_hours":"Office hours are Mondays from 12:00 to 13:00.
