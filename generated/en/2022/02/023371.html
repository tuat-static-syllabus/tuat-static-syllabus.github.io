Through these experiments, you will learn how to accurately measure various chemical phenomena such as the reaction behavior of organic molecules. This course could help acquire a complex set of abilities for becoming a creative and independent researcher.\n\nClassroom code of this course: rekqy5y","expected_learning":"To reach a level where you can voluntarily carry out a research process: construction of the physical model (hypothesis), assemble the experimental system, search, problem-solving, and discovery.\n(Organic chemistry)\nTo understand the organic reaction of carbonyl compounds by comparing with reactivity, structural features, and stability of the carbonyl compounds.\n(Physical chemistry)\nCultivate and/or improve abilities to interpret various phenomena theoretically through careful observations and precise measurements of accompanying changes in physical quantities, followed by detailed analyses of available data.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: C (See the Curriculum maps.)\n\n","course_schedule":"1W: Guidance\n2W-13W: Experiments\n[Organic chemistry]\n(1) Synthesis of ε-caprolactam\n(2) Ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactam\n(3) Grignard reaction\n(4) Wittig reaction\n(5) Friedel-Crafts reaction\n[Physical chemistry]\n(1) Kinetics of hydrolysis\n(2) The electromotive force of a chemical cell\n(3) The surface tension of a solution\n(4) X-ray diffraction\n(5) Equilibrium constant\n(6) Computer programming\n(7) Adsorption, catalytic chemistry\n(8) English reading\n","prerequisites":"Students are required to prepare for each experiment from the safety point of view. They should carefully read the textbook to understand the content of the experiments (15 h).\nAfter the experiment is completed, the students should make an experiment report, which should be submitted within the specified due date (30 h).\nIn addition to the 90 hours that students spend in the class, students are recommended to perform the above task using the textbook and the references specified below.\nIn completing this course, students will spend the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\n\nStudents entering this class should carry the student's disaster and accident insurance for student education and research.\nStudents may not work in the lab without complete compliance with the safety policy, which will be announced at the course guidance (1st day) in detail.\n","texts_and_materials":"Textbook ed. by our Department and documents are given at the guidance.","assessment":"Your grade will be determined largely by a total score of report points (containing quiz score) (50%) and degree of participation in class (50%). Your attitude in the laboratory will also be considered. You are expected to attend the course guidance and all lectures and laboratory sessions to pass the course.\nIf you have unexcused absences, arriving in class late, and late and/or missing reports, you may not receive a passing grade.\n\nGrade distribution (2020)\nS:none, A:93.1%, B:2.3%, C:2.3%, D:2.3%","message_from_instructor":"Work safely and enjoy the investigation of physical changes associated with chemical reactions. Color changing, energy changing, deposition, smell, fuming, and so on… These are important factors to grasp a whole chemical reaction.\nFor the purposes of this class, see [Outline] and [Standard] in this Syllabus.","course_keywords":"Applied experiment, physical chemistry, computer chemistry","office_hours":"Ask to instructors by e-mail: addresses of the other instructors are shown at the guidance.","remarks_1":"(1) Report submission deadline: 8:40 am on the designated date in principle\n(2) Rollcall: Start at 13:00 (Wear experimental clothes before 13:00 and sit in the designated place)","remarks_2":"There is the possibility of changing the curriculum due to the influence of the COVID-19. Attend orientations and cautiously check an announcement from staff.","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/4/2022 2:44:37 PM","name":{"id":2516,"ja":"応用化学実験Ⅲ","en":"Experiments in Applied ChemistryⅢ"},"instructor":{"id":2307,"ja":"森 啓二, 後藤 健","en":"MORI Keiji, GOTO Ken"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses","department":"","semester":"1st","course_type":"1st","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Mon.3～5,Tue.3～5","references":"General reading: textbooks and reference books are available in the library.\n\nOrganic Chemistry -Structure and Function- sixth edition (K.
