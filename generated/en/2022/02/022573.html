Basic theory and up-to-date technology will be presented in the class. Especially, the cutting principles grinding principles for metal, ceramics and plastics will be taught.\n\n(Omnibus / Total 15 classes)\n(Hiroyuki Sasahara / 8 classes) Students will learn the machining principle of cutting process of metals, ceramics, plastics, etc. And they also learn machine tools and the relationship with design of the products.\n(Wataru Natsu / 7 classes) (1) Learn the principles and features of electric discharge machining and electrolytic machining, in which the tool does not contact the workpiece, regardless of the hardness of the material, and the machining system including the machining power supply and control device.\n","expected_learning":"Students can explain the mechanism of shape creation by machine tools and tools, and the principles of electric discharge machining and electrolytic machining. When machining a part, they can select a machine tool in consideration of machining accuracy, production volume, economy, etc. And they can roughly consider the processing procedure. In addition, physical phenomena at the machining point can be explained.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy:\nSee the Curriculum maps.\n\n","course_schedule":"1.Background of machining process\n2.High-value machining and manufacturing processes.\n3.Cutting Process 1.
