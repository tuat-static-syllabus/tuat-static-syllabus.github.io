For example, mechanical systems such as automobiles, electric appliances, trains, etc. are blending into our lives. Conversely, if there is no mechanical system, it may be difficult to keep current life. When we classify these machine systems roughly, they are divided into mechanical systems that generate, transmit or move power, and electronics that control them and exchange information with people. Regarding the former, we learn from lecture subjects in the field of mechanical engineering, whereas the latter is a learning content that has greatly advanced in academic fields of electrical engineering and electronic engineering. It can be said that the mechanical system has greatly developed through the fusion of these two disciplines.\nThose who are expected to grow as mechanical engineers of the future, please take subjects of electronics as the basis of mechatronics required in society.\n\n\n\n","expected_learning":"1) To understand an electric current and voltage of the direct-current circuit\n2) To understand the voltage, an electric current, and a phase of the AC circuit and to explain impedance\n3) To understand the operation of the semiconductor and to explain the characteristic of diode and transistor\n4) To explain the operation of op-amp circuit and to design the op-amp circuit for given equation\n","course_schedule":"Chapter 1 DC circuit\nLesson 1: We will explain the contents of this lecture, the position and the necessity in mechanical systems engineering, the goal, and the evaluation method.
