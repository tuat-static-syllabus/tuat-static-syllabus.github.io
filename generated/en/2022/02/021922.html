More specifi cally, we will fi rst learn basic propertiesof vector spaces and their bases. Then, we will also introduce the defi nition of linear maps and observe the relation betweenlinear maps and matrices. In particular, the properties of a change of basis will be investigated. Finally, we will learn abouteigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices and their applications.","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is to be capable of:\n(1) constructing a basis of a given vector space,\n(2) calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square matrices of order 3,\n(3) solving problems about inner product of vectors and orthonormal bases,\n(4) performing diagonalization of square matrices.\n\nCorresponding criteria in the Diploma Policy: See the Curriculum maps.","course_schedule":"Google Classroom will be used for quizzes and assignments in each week.\n\n[Google Classroom Code]\nslylag6\n\n1-2.
