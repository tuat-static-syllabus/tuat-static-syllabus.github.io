The application of the enzymes and proteins will be introduced.\nGoogle class code is \"hlro5sz\".\n","expected_learning":"The students will know the relationship between the structure and funciton of proteins and how we can analysis and improve those fuctions with protein engineering. Commercialization is also very important process for the studetns in Dept. Engineering, so we will introduce those successful examples.","course_schedule":"The following issues will be lectured.\n1. Fundamental understanding of the structure of ptoteins as polypeptides.\n2. Fundamental methodologies for the analyses of protein structures.\n3. The methodology for comparison of protein structures.\n4. The methodology for structural prediction of proteins.\n5. The methodology for prediction of interactions of proteins.\n6. How to transform the E. coli with the target gene.\n7. How to produce target proteins in E. coli.\n8. How to change amino acid of the target protein (site directed mutagensis).\n9. Nucleic acid engineering.\n10. Aptamer\n11. Commercially available enzymes.\n12. The problems in commecialization of proteins.\n\n","prerequisites":"To better understanding, it is recommended to take the lecture of \"Basic phycics\", \"Basic Chemistry\" and \"Basic biology\".
