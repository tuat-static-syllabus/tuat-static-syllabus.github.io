The following components will be studied through some basic lectures, case studies and group work.\n1. Overview and process to improve product design quality\n2. Overview and process to use the Quality Function Deployment which combines customer’s requirement with design specification\n3. Overview and process to use an idea creation method TRIZ which realize the innovative technologies\n4. Overview and process to use the Quality Robust Engineering which decides design parameters effectively\n\nThe lecturer of this course has the firsthand experiences on product design/ development in an electronic company and will indicate and discuss actual examples in industries as case-studies.\n\nThis course is offered as one of the Scientific General Education courses of the Global Liberal Arts Studies.","expected_learning":"1. To understand the effective process of product development and design\n2. To learn team design by means of thinking, speaking and discussing self-motivated in the group work\n\nCompetency development:\nIndependently thinking, Self-motivation, Leadership, adjusting skill, Communication, Writing skill, Presentation skill, Subject researching and solving skill\n","course_schedule":"1st day：\n#1 Guidance: Overview and importance of design quality: The structure of all lectures in this course will be explained and the positioning/importance of design quality will be indicated from the historical transition of design in the industry field.\n\n#2 Design Quality Improvement Method 1 Quality Function Deployment: As the first step of design quality improvement, QFD (Quality Function Deployment) which sets specifications satisfying customer requirement effectively will be lectured.\n\n#3 QFD Practice: Quality Table as the first part of QFD will be worked by groups.\n\n\n2nd day:\n#4 Design Quality Improvement Method 2 Engineering idea creation by TRIZ: Innovative ideas are essential to realize advanced specifications. Russian origin idea creation system TRIZ which is only one effective tool especially for engineering subject and is adopted to many companies will be lectured.\n\n#5 TRIZ Practice: TRIZ will be worked by groups to create ideas to realize specification made by Quality Table in lecture #3.\n\n\n3rd day:\n#6 Design Quality Improvement Method 3 Quality Robust Engineering (Parameter Design): Quality Robust Engineering which combines design parameters best to prevents quality problems in many companies as the third step of design quality improvement will be lectured.\n\n#7 Quality Robust Engineering (Parameter Design) Case study: Quality Robust Engineering has been widely adopted in most of automobile, office machine and electronic product manufacturers and reported more than 1000 cases at the Quality Engineering Society. Some typical cases among them will be introduced to understand their actual use.\n\n#8 Quality Robust Engineering Practice: Quality Robust Engineering will be worked by groups utilizing an easy simulation.\n","prerequisites":"Each group is expected to complete the subject even after the lecture time. Apx. 5 hours for each day, total 15 hours of review time will be required to deepen your understanding.\nIn addition to 16 hours in this class and the activities described above, students are recommended to prepare for and revise the classes spending the standard amount of time as specified by the University.\n","texts_and_materials":"Dedicated material will be distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"Grades are given based 40% on attending the classes, 30% on richness of daily reports and 30% on contribution/results of the group work.","message_from_instructor":"This course lectures overviews and methods to apply your technical knowledge learned in the other courses into product design effectively.\nThose knowledge and experience will be great use when you will work in companies as engineers.","course_keywords":"Design quality, QFD, Quality function deployment, Quality table, TRIZ, Idea creation, Quality robust engineering, Parameter design, Design of experiment, Orthogonal table, Case study","office_hours":"After each lecture, or send an e-mail to \"o.kumasaka@gmail.com\"","remarks_1":"One hour extension will be prepared to discuss more about the lecture if requested by any student.","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://www.triz-japan.org/ 　　　http://www.rqes.or.jp/","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/7/2022 12:12:14 AM","name":{"id":2481,"ja":"産学連携科目（工学設計実践論）","en":"Industry-Academia Collaborative Class (Engineering Design Pragmatic Course)"},"instructor":{"id":1951,"ja":"熊坂 治","en":"KUMASAKA Osamu"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":6,"min":2,"max":3},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"Liberal Arts and Fundamental Studies","department":"","semester":"4th","course_type":"4th","facility_affiliation":"Organization for the Advancement of Education and Global Learning","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"大藤忠、赤尾洋二、小野道照,「品質展開法(1)」,日科技連出版社,1990\n笠井肇, 「開発設計のためのTRIZ入門」,日科技連出版社,2006\n田口伸,「タグチメソッド入門」,日本規格協会,2016\n"}}
