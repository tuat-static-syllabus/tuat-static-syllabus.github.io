Hilgard (1833-1916) said. We have been looking at and dealing with complex phenomena and complex interactions are always behind our problems to be solved. This course aims to introduce fundamental knowledge of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory for green clean food technology. This course consists of four sections. The first section is introduction of theory of nonlinear dynamics and chaos. The second section demonstrates its application to agriculture. In the third section, we learn how to analyze complex data based on nonlinear time series analysis tools. The last section is a seminar given by UC Davis faculty to discuss how to apply nonlinear dynamics concepts to the topic.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1) Introduction of Nonlinear Dynamics\n#1 Basic population ecology\n#2 Introduction of chaos theory using simple models of population ecology.\n\n2) Application of Nonlinear Dynamics to Green Clean Food Production\n#1 Alternate bearing of citrus..\n#2 Synchronization of tree crop productions\n\n3) Exercise of Data Analysis\n#1 Nonlinear time series analysis\n#2 Hands on data analysis\n\n4) Advances of Green Clean Food Technology\n#1 Lecture on a selected topic for green clean food technology given by UC Davis faculty.\n#2 Discussions in terms of chaos and complex theory\n\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"handout and PPT","assessment":"Attendance,Quiz","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"biological modelling, chaos theory, nonlinear dynamics, synchronization","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"8/31/2017 11:27:33 AM","name":{"id":1742,"ja":"グリーンクリーン食料生産特論Ⅱ","en":"Green and Clean Food Production Advancement Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":330,"ja":"酒井 憲司","en":"SAKAI Kenshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"LEADING PROGRAM","category":"","department":"","semester":"YearLong","course_type":"YearLong","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
