In organic chemistry, stereochemisty is the most important issue. This course covers definition of stereochemistry, chirality, and basic reaction modes. This course also provides relationship stereochemistry and kinetics of substitution reaction and elimination reaction of alkyl halide. In addition, this course covers addition reaction to alkenes.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n(1) Understand nomenclature on stereochemistry (enantiomer, diastereomer, R/S definition)\n(2) Describe reaction on alkyl halide (SN1, SN2, E1, E2) in view of stereochemistry and kinetics\n(3) Describe reactivity of alkene and selectivity of reaction\n","course_schedule":"Week1: Introduction, Stereochemistry (1) (Chirality, nomenclature)\nWeek 2: Stereochemistry (2)（Chirality and enantiomer）\nWeek 3: Stereochemistry (3)（Chirality and enantiomer）\nWeek 4: Practice（Molecular Model, Practice）\nWeek 5: Stereochemistry (4)（Diastereomer and enantiomer）\nWeek 6: Alkyl halide (1) （Nomenclature, structure, property, and preparation)\nWeek 7: Alkyl halide (2) (Substituent reaction: stereochemistry and kinetics)\nWeek 8: Alkyl halide (2) (Elimination reaction: stereochemistry and kinetics)\nWeek 9: Alkene (1) (Nomenclature, structure, property, and preparation）\nWeek 10 Mid-semester examination\nWeek 11: Alkene (2) (Reactivity of alkene, addition reaction)\nWeek 12: Alkene (3) (Addition reaction)\nWeek 13: Alkene (4) (Addition reaction)\nWeek 14: Alkene (Reaction of carbene, Organometallic reaction)\nWeek 15: Examination (from Week 1 to week 14)\n","prerequisites":"This class is based on contents of organic chemistry in the spring semester.\n\n","texts_and_materials":"Organic Chemistry (8th edition) Leroy G.
