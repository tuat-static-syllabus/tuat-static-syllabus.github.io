This course mainly covers classical wet analysis based on chemical reactions. Although modern analysis is dependent mainly on physicochemical instruments, the basis of the analysis is supported by the classical chemical analysis. First, learners will learn how to quantitatively treat with various chemical equilibria in aqueous solutions, and subsequently their applications to volumetric and gravimetric analysis, followed by introductory lectures on separation methods used in chemical analysis such as ion exchange and solvent extraction. This course provides students with the chemical foundation toward more specialized chemistry courses by learning analytical chemistry.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to understand chemical equilibria in solution and basis of chemical analysis based on the chemical equilibria.","course_schedule":"Fundamentally this lecture proceeds according to the textbook in Japanese shown below, excluding Chpt. 7 and 8 concerning instrumental analysis. Problems for self-study will be distributed, and the answers are checked on the blackboard as exercises in the beginning of several lectures. The questions in the exams will be given partly in English but in Japanese for the rest. The course schedule will be as follows:\n\nWeek 1: Introduction, What is analytical chemistry, Notation of concentration\nWeek 2: Measurements and errors, Precision and accuracy, Significant figure\nWeek 3: Volumetric analysis 1 (concept of acid/base, acid-base dissociation)\nWeek 4: Volumetric analysis 2 (chemical equilibria in solution, acid-base titration)\nWeek 5: Volumetric analysis 3 (redox reaction, Nernst equation)\nWeek 6: Volumetric analysis 4 (redox titration)\nWeek 7: Volumetric analysis 5 (coordination compound, chelate reaction)\nWeek 8: Midterm exam\nWeek 9: Volumetric analysis 6 (precipitation titration)\nWeek 10: Gravimetric analysis 1 (precipitate formation)\nWeek 11: Gravimetric analysis 2 (thermogravimetry, operation in gravimetric analysis)\nWeek 12: Separation, Solvent extraction\nWeek 13: Solid-phase extraction, Ion-exchange separation\nWeek 14: Basic chromatography\nWeek 15: Term-end exam","prerequisites":"Students entering this class are assumed to have learned Chemistry in Japanese high school curriculum or its equivalent. Otherwise, there will be difficulty in understanding part of the contents in this course. In this case it is strongly recommended to study the relevant field by yourself, especially chemical and ionization equilibria, until May.","texts_and_materials":"K. Oguma and T.
