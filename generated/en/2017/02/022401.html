They are also relavent to properties of solid materials. Therefore understanding on how electrons behave in molecules or solid materials is quite important. In this lecture, we understand basics of quantum chemistry.","expected_learning":"The followings should be understood.\n1. Why do we need quantum chemistry?\n2. wave nature of electrons\n3. Schrodinger equation\n4. Chemical bondings and electrons","course_schedule":"(The schedule would be changed depending on situation.)\n1. Condtradiction in classical mechanics (some examples).\n2. Schrodinger equation and wavefunction\n3. Restriction on wavefunctions. Operater and eigenfunction\n4. Superposition of wavefunctions, Heisenberg uncertainty principle\n5. Exercises\n6. Wavefunction for particle in a box (1-dimensional)\n7. Tunnelling and particle in a box (2-dimensional)\n8. Midterm exam.\n9. Rotation and quantification of orbital angular momentum\n10. Quantum numbers and orbitals of an electron\n11. Multielectron aton and Pauli principle\n12. Molecular orbital theory and variation principle\n13. Huckel approximation\n14.
