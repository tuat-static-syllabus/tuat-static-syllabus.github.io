It is designed for junior (third year) undergraduate students. This course helps students understanding essential technical background for micro / nanofabrication. Moreover, principles in MEMS devices and phenomena upon with microchips will be introduced by instructors. In addition, through this course, students can learn how to understand principles and phenomena, and build a strong knowledge base. The course is divided into two halves. The first half of the term will be taught by Prof. Ando and focus on an introduction to silicon-based MEMS. The second half of the term will be taught by Prof. Iwami and applications and case studies of MEMS devices to various fields will be introduced.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"Lec # Lecture Topics Sub Topics\nPart I: Silicon-based MEMS\n1 Guidance\n2 Introduction to MEMS: MEMS and micromachine\n3 Outline of MEMS fabrication: Dry and wet etching\n4 Actuators: electrostatic, piezoelectric and electromagnetic actuators\n5 Microcantilever & SPM: AFM, STM\n6 Examples of MEMS devices for measurements: 3D microstage, lateral force sensor\n7 Micro/nano tribology: Issues in lubrication for MEMS\nPart II: Applications and Case studies\n8 Sensor applications I: accelerometers, gyro sensors\n9 Sensor applications II: pressure sensors\n10 Optical MEMS I: Micromirror devices, optical communications\n11 Optical MEMS II: Nanophotonic devices, plasmonics, radiation contorol\n12 Lithography and beam applications: Electron beam lithography and focused ion beam\n13 BioMEMS: medical applications, organ fusion, bio 3D printing\n14 RF MEMS: IT and MEMS, IoT\n15 Final Exam","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Attendance & quiz: 60%\nFinal Exam: 40%\n","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"Tue 10:00-17:00","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/27/2017 11:48:36 AM","name":{"id":799,"ja":"ＭＥＭＳ","en":"MEMS Technology"},"instructor":{"id":715,"ja":"安藤 泰久, 岩見 健太郎","en":"ANDO Yasuhisa, IWAMI Kentaro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Tue.4","references":""}}
