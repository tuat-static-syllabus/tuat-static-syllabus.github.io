One is the natural world that preceded us and of which we are a part. The other is the world of social institutions and artifacts that we create for ourselves using science and Technology, and political organization. Both worlds are essential to our lives, but integrating them successfully causes enduring tensions. In this course, we introduce relationships between natural world and environmental science and technology.\n","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"Schedule\n・ Orientation\n・ Pollution of Drinking water in the world\n・ Water Quality in drinking water\n・ Sampling in the Field\n・ Analyzing the water\n・ Student Presentation and Discussion\n\nPresentation\nUsing sampling data\n\nField Trip\nNational Museum of Emerging Science and innovation\nNational Science Museum in Ueno\nAquarium at Kasai Rinkai Kouen\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Attendance, Presentation,","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Science& Technology","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/30/2017 10:50:29 AM","name":{"id":490,"ja":"Environmental Science and Technology","en":"Environmental Science and Technology"},"instructor":{"id":295,"ja":"川端 良子","en":"KAWABATA Yoshiko"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Tue.4","references":""}}
