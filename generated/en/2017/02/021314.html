Especially, #1-#3 reviews the contents of chapter 4-7 studied in O.C.I.","expected_learning":"Comprehension of polar (ionic) reactions of saturated hydrocarbons with specific leaving (eliminating) groups, i.e., nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions, in relation to the absolute configulation. Understanding the characteristics of sp2 orbitals and the reactivity of olefinic hydrocarbons.","course_schedule":"#1 Orientation and reviews of chapters 6, \"chemical reactions (especially SN2) of haloalkanes in relation to SN1, E1 and E2 reactions\"\n#2 Chapter 7, mainly on SN1, E1 and E2 reactions\n#3,4 Thermodynamic and Kinetic controls of E2 reactions. Reviews of SN2, SN1, E1 and E2 reactions in relation to the difference of nucleophiles and chemical environments.\n#5,6 A study and practice on chapter 8, “-OH carrying organics, alcohols: characteristics, synthesis and synthetic strategies of alcohols with complicated structures”\n#7,8 A study and practice on chapter 9, “Reactions of alcohols and ethers”\n#9 A study and practice on chapter 10, “Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy―a brief theory”\n#10-12 A study and practice on chapter 11, “Alkenes and IR spectroscopy―a brief theory for spectroscopy”\n#13-15 A study and practice on chapter 12, “Reactions of alkenes”―the most important chapter to understand the reactivity of π-orbital carrying unsaturated hydrocarbons, that will be followed by Organic Chemistry III.\nThe agenda described above is the standard progressives. However, if it goes faster than that planned, more detailed lecturing will be held on the contents of Chap. 12, in turn if being retarded, extralecturing will be necessary in the end of semester.","prerequisites":"Attending O.C.I throughout the semester is the definite pre-requisite. Since O.C. is the typical “piling-up” subject, it is very difficult to learn O.C.II without the enough comprehension and knowledge of O.C.I. Therefore, it is highly recommended to practice self-reviewing in prior to face O.C.II, if your O.C.I score is B or less.","texts_and_materials":"Throughout O.C.I-V, “Organic Chemistry - Structure and Function”, 7th-ed., K.P.C.Volhardt and N.E.Schore, W.H.Freeman and Co.","assessment":"Evaluation will be settled by the end-term examination.","message_from_instructor":"【attention!】Do not mix “memorize” and “comprehend”. Subject naming (according to IUPAC rules)―memorize, chemical reactions―comprehend. Nobody memorizes a great numbers of reaction schemes (I really do not!). Your memory bank is not almighty to O.C., especially beyond O.C.I. Better to reconstruct the tactics and strategy of your study. There is no royal road !","course_keywords":"Haloalkanes, nucleophilic substitution (SN1，SN2), elimination (E1,E2), alcohols, ethers, alkenes","office_hours":"Make an appointment by phone, or e-mail.
