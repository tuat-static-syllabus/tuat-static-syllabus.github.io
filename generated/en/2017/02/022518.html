Furthermore, its machining or assembly can be planned and evaluated on the basis of 3D model. Therefore, it is indispensable to use 3D CAD (Computer Aided Design) through design and production of modern mechanical systems. In this exercises, the goal is to acquire the operation method of 3D model. In the first half, students generate and assemble 3D model of parts of Stirling engine and realize the motion simulation on computer. In the latter half, students address free drawing of mechanical system and present it at the last week.","expected_learning":"(1) Modeling and assembly of 3D mechanical parts, and motion simulation of mechanical system\n(2) Understanding of representation method and data structure of 3D CAD, and modification of given 3D model\n(3) 3D model generation and drawing from 2D drawing\n(4) Acquisition of basic operation method of 3D CAD, usage of on-line help for unclear operation by oneself","course_schedule":"Week 1 : Guidance, Installing Solidworks, and on-line tutorials\nWeek 2-3 : On-line tutorials and install CAD on applicant’s laptop\nWeek 4-6 : Modeling of parts of stirling engine\nWeek 7-8 : Assembly and motion simulation of stirling engine\nWeek 9 : Midterm examination\nWeek 10-13 : Free drawing\nWeek 14 : Presentation of free drawing\nStudents use Room K2A (2nd floor of Media center) and take on-line tutorials and assignments by 3D CAD.","prerequisites":"It is expected that students have already acquired a fundamental knowledge of “Mechanical drawing” and ”Mechanical systems”.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Presence : 30%, ，Midterm exam : 30%, Free drawing : 40%","message_from_instructor":"It is desirable to practice software such as 3D CAD by oneself.
