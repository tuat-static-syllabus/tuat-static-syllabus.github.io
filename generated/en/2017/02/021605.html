The nature of life is understood in the framework of material science. Chemistry is a powerful theory to classify systematically a tremendous amount of knowledge on the material world. For the students who are not major in chemistry, the series of lectures show the tyipical topics of chemistry by including a number of physical viewpoints at chemical phenomena.","expected_learning":"We aim to have an ability of thinking chemical phenomena, not just to put chemical terminologies into your memory. So it is indispesible to participate in every class, to listen to the lecture, and to ttry to understand it.","course_schedule":"1. Historical backgrounds of chemistry and physics.\n2. The chemistry of appearance and shope.\n3. The chemistry of color.\n4. The origins of elements (elemental systhesis).\n5. Atomic structures.\n6. Molecular structures and chemical bonds.\n7. Atmopheric environments.\n8. Phases of materials.\n9. The chemistry of water.\n10. What is the state of solution?\n11. Oxidation and reduction.\n12. Chemical analysis.\n13. Physics of chemical reaction.\n14. Stimulation and transformation in biological systems.\n15. What is chemistry?","prerequisites":"Not specified. Students major in applied physics are requested to have a basic way of thinking of chemistry. All freshmen students in applied physics are welcome.","texts_and_materials":"Not specified. Summary of power-point slides presented in a lecture will be provided for every lecture.","assessment":"Examination at the end of semester, a few reports, and short quizzes.","message_from_instructor":"Chemistry is systematic theory in collaboration with physics on the material world.
