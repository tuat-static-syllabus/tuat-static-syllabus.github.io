In universities, interdisciplinary studies of those fields are necessary to learn science. This course is designed for you to experience topics of science by conducting experiments, which cover diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, informatics, security, and environments. You learn how to develop your specialties with broad views through performing the experiments by own thoughts.","expected_learning":"We expect you all to learn to\n(1) Understand principles of the experiments.\n(2) Appropriately conduct the experiments from comprehension of purposes and methods of the experiments.\n(3) Analyze experimental data and make reasonable conclusions.\n(4) Lead scientific discussion from the experimental results.\n(5) Write your reports of the above items.\n","course_schedule":"The registered students are divided into two groups, group A and B, and their experiment topics are scheduled alternately. Here, a schedule for the students in group A is described. A schedule for group B is the one that week 4 and 5, week 6 and 7, week 9 and 10 and week 11 and 12 of the group A schedule are re-ordered, respectively. The detail is explained at the orientations in week 3 and 8.\n\nWeek 1 Handling of scientific information (Training for library database searching)\nWeek 2 Information processing (Information media center, Training for information processing, numerical analysis)\nWeek 3 Orientations for experiments in week 4 to 7\nWeek 4 DNA profiling (DNA profiling and electrophoresis)\nWeek 5 Natural order (Observation of repetitive motion, simple harmonic oscillator, by high speed camera)\nWeek 6 Bioimaging analysis (Analysis of molecular images using ImageJ)\nWeek 7 Solar cell (Measurement of electric power sources in real life)\nWeek 8 Orientations for experiments in week 9 to 12\nWeek 9 Infrared security sensor (Fabrication of infrared light detection circuit)\nWeek 10 Environmental analysis (Qualitative analysis of inorganic ions)\nWeek 11 Data mining (Statistical analysis of human errors)\nWeek 12 Quantification of bio-related materials (Quantification of vitamin C by redox titration)\nWeek 13 Supplementary experiment 1 (or individual training about experiment reports）\nWeek 14 Supplementary experiment 2 (or oral examination on the experiments in chemistry, biology and environment)\nWeek 15 Supplementary experiment 3 (or oral examination on the experiments in physics, electronics, mechanics and informatics)\n","prerequisites":"Students entering this class are assumed to have had a high school experimental knowledge.","texts_and_materials":"Prepared by the instructor of every experiment.","assessment":"Homework: 20%\nAttendance: 20%\nReports: 40%\nExperiment participation, Oral examination: 20%\n\nCaution:\nWhen one meets any of the following conditions, the course grade is evaluated as “D” (Failure) automatically.\n1. Absence without any appropriate reasons (including the orientations)\n2. Repeated lateness\n3. Less participation in the experiments\n4. Violation of safety rules\n5. Failure of submitting all reports\n6. Extreme delay for report submission deadlines\n7. Disobeying other prohibited matters described in the instruction text\nThe detail is explained at the first orientation.\n","message_from_instructor":"Experiment course is integrated course of science. The registered students should understand backgrounds and theories of each experiment by reading the instruction text and other supplementary materials in prior work, participate in the experiments, and submit reports of the corresponding experiments. Please do not attend the course aimlessly. Your active participation is expected.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"During the course hours and just after the course.
