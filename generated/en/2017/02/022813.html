Basic concepts and notations on integers (pp.56-59)\n2. Sets and maps, the definition of algebraic systems (pp.8-18, p,22)\n3. Equivalent relations and quotient sets (pp.19-20)\n4. Semigroups and groups, examples of groups (pp.23-27, pp.44-48)\n5. Normal subgroups and quotient groups (p.28, pp.40-42 except for homomorphisms)\n6. Homomorphisms and isomorphisms of groups, the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms (pp.36-42)\n7. Exercises I\n8. Rings and fields (pp.30-34)\n9. Ideals of rings and quotient rings (pp.50-54)\n10. Euclidean algorism and the inverse of an integer modulo n (pp.69-74)\n11. Systems of linear congruence equations, Chinese remainder theorem (pp.74-76, p.149)\n12. Fermat's little theorem and Euler's theorem, Fermat primality test (pp.86-92)\n13. Polynomials over a field, field extensions (pp.109-119)\n14. Exercises II\n15.

However, it is closely linked to well-known integers or polynomials. I will make efforts to give concrete examples in the lecture.","course_keywords":"Algebraic system, Group, Ring, Field, Homomorphism, Normal subgroup, Ideal, Equivalent class, Congruence equation","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/25/2017 10:21:05 AM","name":{"id":673,"ja":"代数学Ⅰ","en":"Algebra Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":302,"ja":"與口 卓志","en":"YOGUCHI Takashi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Mon.3","references":"Ryuuichi Hirabayashi, “Kougaku Kiso Daisuukei to Sono Ouyou”, Suurikougaku-sha (in Japanese)\nNaoki Kawata, “Seisuu to Gun, Kan, Tai”, Gendai-Suugakusha (in Japanese)\nKoukichi Sugiwara, Toshiyuki Imai, “Kougaku no Tame no Ouyou Daisuu”, Kyouritsu Shuppan (in Japanese)\n"}}
