You will not be able to master the fundamentals for organic chemistry by simply attending the lectures. It is essential to solve the problems by yourself for deep understanding of organic chemistry. In this course, therefore, you will be required to solve the problems from the textbooks (John McMurry, Organic Chemistry) used in the Organic Chemistry I, II, and III.\nExams will be given every week according to the course schedule announced in the course guidance. What each exam covers will also be given in the schedule. The problems in the exam will be assigned from the text for each chapter and/or will be similar to those found in the text.\nThe course formate consists of 1) reviewing the scheduled chapters, 2) exams for the corresponding chapters, and 3) explanation of how to solve the problems.\n","expected_learning":"Objective of this course is to gain a solid understanding of basic organic chemistry by solving problems. The students will be able to explain various phenomena regarding organic chemistry or reactions based on your acquired knowledge.","course_schedule":"Week 1: Course Guidance\nWeek 2: Structure and Bonding (Chapter 1) and Polar Covalent Bonds, Acids and Bases (Chapter2)\nWeek 3: Alkanes and Cycloalkanes and Their Stereochemistry (Chapters 3 and 4)\nWeek 4: An Overview of Organic Reactions (Chapter 5) and Alkenes: Structure and Reactivity (Chapter 6) Week 5: Alkenes: Reactions and Synthesis (Chapter 7) and Alkynes: An Introduction to Organic Synthesis (Chapter 8)\nWeek 6: Stereochemistry (Chapter 9) and Organohalides (Chapter 10)\nWeek 7: Reactions of Organohalides: Nucleophilic Substitutions and Eliminations (Chapter 11) and Conjugated Compounds (Chapter 14)\nWeek 8: Mid-term Exam for week 1-7\nWeek 9: Benzene and Aromaticity (Chapter 15) and Chemistry of Benzene: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Chapter 16)\nWeek 10: Alcohols and Phenols (Chapter 17) and Ethers and Epoxides; Thiols and Sulfides (Chapter 18)\nWeek 11: Aldehydes and Ketones: Nucleophilic Addition Reactions (Chapter 19) and Carboxylic Acids and Nitriles (Chapter 20)\nWeek 13: Carboxylic Acid Derivatives: Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution Reactions (Chapter 21) and Carbonyl Alpha-Substitution Reactions (Chapter 22)\nWeek 14: End-term Exam foe Week 9-13\n","prerequisites":"Organic Chemistry I, II, III","texts_and_materials":"John McMurry, Organic Chemistry","assessment":"Your grade will be determined largely by a total score of exam points and attendance points.
