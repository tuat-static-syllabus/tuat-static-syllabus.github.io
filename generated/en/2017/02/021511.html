Namely, we will treat contents of classical mechanics. More concretely, setting up equations correctly, solving the equations of motion (differential form),\ntreating motion from a viewpoint of work and energy, and rotary motion introducing a concept of angular momentum etc. will be learned. In order to understand these concepts and describe laws, the knowledge on mathematics such as differential equations and vector is necessary, and the explanation will be done at all such times.\n\nGoal:\nWe expect a target to develop ability to solve somewhat difficult questions by yourself, by understanding the above concepts. For this reason, quiz and exercise will be executed every time.\n","expected_learning":"Mechanics is a base of the physics field, and it is important to understand the specialized fields in a mechanical system in future. In this lecture, we aim at making students understand resistance force and oscillation, motion including rotation, and work and energy.","course_schedule":"First Lecture - Expression of motion: Concepts and relationships between displacement, velocity and acceleration will be\nlearned, using vectors and differential and integral calculus. As an example, uniform circular motion will be explained.\n\nSecond Lecture - Laws of motion: Reviewing laws of motion learned at a high school, so-called “ re-interpretation of the laws” will be introduced to understand a deep meaning.\n\nThird Lecture - Setup of equations of motion: Procedure to solve concrete problems of motion will be learned. In addition, the expression of the second law of motion using momentum will be introduced.\n\nFourth Lecture - Solving equations of motion (I): The equation of motion with a resistivity proportional to the velocity is the first order, linear, homogeneous differential equation. Using a variable separation method, this equation will be solved to obtain a solution. The equation in the presence of gravity will be also solved.\n\nFifth Lecture - Solving equations of motion (II): The equation of simple oscillation is the second order, linear, homogeneous differential equation. Using a method such as an energy integral method, this equation will be solved.\n\nSixth Lecture - Solving equations of motion (III): As to damped and forced oscillations, solving methods and physical meaning of solutions will be learned.\n\nSeventh Lecture - Review:\n\nEighth Lecture - Exercise in the first half lectures:\n\nNinth Lecture - Work and energy (I): Definition of work, work done by gravity and elastic force, energy principle, and conservation force and potential energy.\n\nTenth Lecture - Work and energy (II): Derivation of conservation force from potential energy, law of mechanical energy conservation, and examples of non-conservation force.\n\nEleventh Lecture - Universal gravitation and motion of planets: characteristic of universal gravitation, potential energy of universal gravitation, and derivation of Kepler’s laws.\n\nTwelfth Lecture - Rotary motion and angular momentum: Definition of moment of force and angular momentum, equation of rotary motion, and central force and law of conservation of momentum.\n\nThirteenth Lecture: Motion of object in a non-inertia system: After considering motion of an object in a rotating frame, centrifugal force as well as a direction and strength of Coriolis force will be derived.\n\nFourteenth Lecture - Review:\n\nFifteenth Lecture - Exercise in the second half lectures:","prerequisites":"Learning physics at a high school is supposed. Having knowledge on mathematics learned at a high school, especially, fundamentals of vector and differential and integral calculus, is also supposed.","texts_and_materials":"Osamu Hirayama and Shunjiro Shinohara, “Solving - Mechanics - in Science and Technology Fields,” Kodansha Scientific.

Two times of exercise results will be graded in addition to a consideration of comments and questions raised etc.","message_from_instructor":"Physics, especially mechanics, is a basic of the specialized fields at the Department of Mechanical System. We expect a target to develop ability to solve somewhat difficult questions by yourself.\n\nTherefore, quiz and exercises will be executed during lectures, and in order to increase the effect of learning, preparation and review are necessary as a home schooling. Our lectures are delivered, relating to the subject “Physics Basics and Exercises” opening in the same term. Any comments and questions are welcome.","course_keywords":"Description of motion, Newton’s law of motion, solving equation of motions, work and energy, angular momentum","office_hours":"Just after the lecture or appointment determination at that time.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://www.tuat.ac.jp/~sinohara/","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/14/2017 2:51:30 PM","name":{"id":544,"ja":"物理学基礎演習","en":"Physics Basics and Exercises"},"instructor":{"id":521,"ja":"篠原 俊二郎","en":"SHINOHARA Shunjiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Mon.4","references":""}}
