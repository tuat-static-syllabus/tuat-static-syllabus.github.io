Also, it connects with the all the areas of engineering. In this lecture, we aim to understand the solid-state science, which is affected by the structural changes such as atomic state, molecular state and crystal structure, and by the changes of electronic states.\nFurthermore, in the latter part of lecture, we will study about the semicomductor physics/chemistry for understanding the new function of material by the introduction of quantum effects and so on.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"#1 Introduction\n#2 Classification of materials\n#3 Structure of ideal solid 1\n#4 Structure of ideal solid 2\n#5 Structure of imperfect solid\n#6 Electronic state of solid 1\n#7 Electronic state of solid 2\n#8 Exercise 1\n#9 Semiconductor and insulator\n#10 Type of semiconductors\n#11 Compound semiconductors and its electronic structure\n#12 Superlattice structure and its electronic structure\n#13 Crystal growth 1\n#14 Crystal growth 2\n#15 Exercise 2\n","prerequisites":"Nothing","texts_and_materials":"Nothing","assessment":"Attendance, midterm exam, final exam, and reports","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Electronic property, material, semiconductor, crystal, superlattice, quantum effect","office_hours":"10:00-16:00 on Monday","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/22/2017 5:11:41 PM","name":{"id":743,"ja":"半導体化学","en":"Semi-conductive Materials Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":691,"ja":"村上 尚","en":"MURAKAMI Hisashi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Thu.2","references":"Recommend in the class"}}
