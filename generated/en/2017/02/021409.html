History of separation process in industry\n(1) Haber-Bosch process (Method of directly synthesizing ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen)\n(2) Gasoline production process\n1.2. Four important “Pollution-related illnesses” in Japan and the contribution of separation process on the solution of this subjects\n(1) Minamata disease : mercury\n(2) Niigata Minamata disease : mercury\nMercury is highly volatile element, still difficult subjects to separate from flue gas. New production process for NaOH without mercury were developed.\n(3) Itai-itai disease : Cadmium emission, Cd ion in sewer water and dust emission\n(4) Asthma in Yokkaichi : Sulfite gas, Nitrogen oxide and dust, fine particles\n？ Gas adsorption, dust collection, filtration (Solid gas, solid liquid separation)\n？ PM2.5 and fine particles emission.\n\nHeavy metal removal, separation from polluted water\n/ ion ？\n1) Liquid-liquid extraction, emulsion dispersion (oil in water, water/oil/water)\n2) Adsorption, Zeolite and other adsorbed material (ferrocyanide)\nExample, Fukusima radioactive material Cesium\nEnvironmental standard = 5000 becquerel : the number of atoms / second\n\n/colloid\n\n1.3. New concepts for chemical production process engineering,\n/ Closed systems\nSeparation and recycling of unreacted raw feedstock\n/ Zero emission\n\n2. Fundamentals of particle motion in fluid (Gas and liquid) for solid-gas, and solid-liquid separation by using mechanical and physical process\n2.1. Inertial motion, gravity sedimentation behavior\n2.2. Stokes equation and terminal velocity\n\n3. Mechanical separation technology I\n3.1. Sedimentation\n3.2. Cyclone\n3.3. Electric separator\n3.4. Particle behavior control, aggregation and sedimentation etc.\n\n4. Mechanical separation technology II\n4.1. Filtration\n4.2. Pressure drop of powder layer and Kozeny-Carman equation\n\n5.
