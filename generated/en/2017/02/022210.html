Good understanding of physical chemistry enables students to predict and theorize chemical reactions. The purpose of this course is to deepen understandings of physical chemistry through the exercises in the textbook of Atkins Physical Chemistry. Students are strongly recommended to take the physical chemistry I and II. Each lecture consists of explanations of examples (20 min), mini examination (50 min), and the commentaries (20 min). This course is taught by three lecturers. This course is mandatory for every student in the department of applied chemistry.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"The contents of the course are summarized as follows,\n1. The properties of gases (equation of gas state, van der Waals equation)\n2. The first law of thermodynamics (Work, heat, energy, conservation law of energy)\n3. The first law of thermodynamics (Enthalpy, Heat capacity at constant volume and constant pressure)\n4. The second law of thermodynamics (Enthalpy and Spontaneous change, Free energy)\n5. The second law of thermodynamics (The variation of the Gibbs energy with temperature and pressure, Gibbs-Helmholtz equation)\n6. Physical transformations of pure substances (Phase boundary, phase transition, Clausius-Clapyron equation)\n7. Simple mixtures (Raoult’s law, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point)\n8. Phase diagram\n9. Equilibrium electrochemistry (Equilibrium constant)\n10. Equilibrium electrochemistry (Le Chatrier’s principle, van’t Hoff equation)\n11. Equilibrium electrochemistry(Cell potential, electromotive force, standard potential)\n\nExamination\n1. Properties of gas and the first law of thermodynamics\n2. The second law of thermodynamics, physical transformations of pure, and Simple mixtures\n3. Phase diagram and Equilibrium electrochemistry\n\n・The first class includes introduction of this class and excercise of the content.\n・The use of calculator is permitted during the course.\n・Students are allowed to use textbooks and notebooks only for mini examinations.\n・Mobile phone and smart phone must be turn off during the course.\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Atkins physical chemistry the 8th edition\nPeter Akins/Julio de Paula, Translated by H.
