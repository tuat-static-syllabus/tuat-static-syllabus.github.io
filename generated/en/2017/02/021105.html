While reviewing high school-level chemistry, classes will introduce the key principles in chemistry, which involves atomic orbitals, valence bond theory, molecular orbital theory, molecular representations, acids and bases, stereochemistry. A particular emphasis is placed on learning the structures of organic compounds, so that it will serve as an introductory course for Bioorganic Chemistry courses.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1：Orientation\n2：Atomic Structures\n3：Chemical bonds\n4：Molecular representations\n5：Acid-base reactions（１）\n6：Acid-base reactions（２）\n7：Atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals（１）\n8：Atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals（２）\n9：Structures of organic compounds（１）\n10：Structures of organic compounds（２）\n11：Nomenclature of organic compounds\n12：Conformations of organic compounds（１）\n13：Conformations of organic compounds（２）\n14：Conformations of organic compounds（３）\n15：Exam：covers materials in session 1-14.\n","prerequisites":"This course will prepare students to study the following higher level courses such as Bioorganic ChemistryI and II, Medicinal Chemistry, Biochemistry I and II, Bioanalytical Chemistry and Bioinorganic Chemistry.","texts_and_materials":"Organic Chemistry 7th Ed.
