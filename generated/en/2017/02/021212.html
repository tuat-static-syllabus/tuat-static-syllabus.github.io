The description of the phenomena is difficult because of its mathematical complex, vector algebra, solving a differential equation, etc. The topics covered are the electromagnetic force and static electric field in vacuum. The knowledge of electromagnetism in this course will be essential for the scientists and engineers.\n","expected_learning":"Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n1. describe and explain the static electric field around a point charge and/or charged materials using Coulomb’s law and Gauss’s law\n2. explain the relation between electric field and electric potential\n3. describe the static electric field using Poisson’s equation\n4. describe the energy of static electric field\nexplain the microscopic Ohm’s law using a motion equation for the charged particle in the static electric field\n","course_schedule":"1st week: Guidance, Review of mathematics\n2nd week: Force on charged particle\n3rd week: Static electric field\n4th week: Line of electric force, Gauss’s Law\n5th week: Application of Gauss’s Law\n6th week: Electric potential\n7th week: Electric dipole\n8th week: 1st examination\n9th week: Gauss’s Law (differential form)\n10th week: Poisson's equation\n11th week: Application of Poisson's equation\n12th week: Metal and insulator\n13th week: Capacitor\n14th week: Properties of static electric current\n15th week: 2nd examination\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Two 90-min examinations will be given, and the each is worth 50% of your grade.","message_from_instructor":"Mastering the skills of understanding, describing, and explaining some electromagnetic phenomena will provide the basic way of logical thinking required in engineering field.","course_keywords":"electric charge, electric field, electric potential, Coulomb's law, Gauss's law, Poisson's equation, Ohm's law","office_hours":"After each lesson or via e-mail.","remarks_1":"A problem-solving provided as homework is effective in understanding the electromagnetic phenomena.
