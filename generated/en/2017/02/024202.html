In addition, students are required to study about their results like 4) interpretation of phenomena and 5) presentation technique which are the representative.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1) Safety education: This is the season for students when they behave in a safe manner in the laboratory. Because new operations will be sometimes added, it is important to exercise every experiments with full attention.\n\n2) Understanding of the purpose, significance, and background of the undergraduate study: Students are required to deeply understand about the significance of the undergraduate study on the basis of results obtained by themselves.\n\n3) Acquisition of knowledge and technique needed for the undergraduate study: Because the amount of requisite knowledge and technique have been increasing along with the progress of the research and they are usually obtained as English articles, it is a good chance to steady study scientific technical English.\n\n4) Interpretation of phenomena: Because students are able to observe experimental phenomena, the data obtained should be interpreted appropriately. Usually, research is on a novel topics, phenomena encountered should be thoroughly understood and for this purpose, they should study the basics again for obtaining good comprehension about issues at the higher level.\n\n5) presentation technique: Because of frequent presentation in a laboratory, ability of students is developed on explanation of their own work and they will be directed to fully grasp the content so as to offer appropriate answers to questions.\n","prerequisites":"The standard of eligibility for undergraduate study should be fulfilled.","texts_and_materials":"Please ask each professors.","assessment":"Evaluation will be comprehensively done on the basis of attendance, presentation, understanding about their research.","message_from_instructor":"Because the undergraduate study is the important course which requires total combination of studies thus far as well as for understand methodology related to understanding of phenomena in wider and deeper manners, it is desirable to study hard at the laboratory seminars.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/22/2017 5:13:56 PM","name":{"id":869,"ja":"先端応用化学演習","en":"Frontier Chemistry Seminar"},"instructor":{"id":691,"ja":"村上 尚","en":"MURAKAMI Hisashi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":10,"min":4,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"後学期","course_type":"後学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"","day_period":"卒研・卒論","references":"Please ask each professors."}}
