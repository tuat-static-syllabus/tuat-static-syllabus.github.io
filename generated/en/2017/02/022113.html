This class aims students to understand basics of chemical reactions occurring in vivo, and to learn basic knowledge of analytical methods for these reactions. Additionally, it is intended to understand the methodology to analyze “changes”. In the class, it is important to understand the relationships between molecular structure and their properties. Also students will understand the special “field” formed by polymers which is important to maintain various life actions. Followings are some concrete topics at the class.\n1. Interactions between molecules, how and why?\n2. Relationships between molecular dynamics and reaction rate\n3. Reaction kinetics and rate law\n\nIt is no meaning to learn equations by rote. Important thing is to understand the meaning of the equations.\n","expected_learning":"　To understand life phenomena physicochemically.\n　To understand various reactions occurred accurately in not a diluted solution but a concentrated solution containing polymers and other materials in vivo.\n","course_schedule":"Characteristics of polymers: Learn the characteristics and nature of polymers working in vivo.\nStructure of molecules and their interactions: Interactions will be comprehended by some cases of different molecules. Learn relationship between molecular structure and intermolecular interactions.\nBiopolymers 1: Learn the relationships between higher ordered structure of polymers and specific functions generated from the structure.\nBiopolymers 2: Learn about entropy and hierarchical polymer structures in solutions.\nMolecular assembly 1: Learn why molecules assembled freely in aqueous media in spite of the decrease in entropy. Also understand the function of cell membranes.\nMolecular assembly 2: Learn a characteristic of surfaces of the aggregated molecules and ions.\nChemical kinetics 1: Learn a kinetics, reaction order and elementary process.\nChemical kinetics 2: Learn Arrhenius equation and activation energy.\nRate equation: Learn the rate determining process and reaction dynamics.\nComplexed mechanism in biochemistry 1: Learn structure and function of cell membrane. How molecules path through the membrane?\nComplexed mechanism in biochemistry 2: Underatanding of enzymatic reactions physicochemically. Learn the electron transfer mechanism in vivo.\n\n","prerequisites":"Take a course in life physical chemistry I in advance. Associated subjects are biochemistry, polymer chemistry, and molecular biology.","texts_and_materials":"Physical Chemistry　for the Life Science (Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK, 2011) by P.
