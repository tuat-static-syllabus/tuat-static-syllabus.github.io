Target\nTo get used to the world of programming using programming language c.\nTo learn the basic methods of use about compiler and development environment.\n\nb. Summary\nThis course uses \"programming language c\" that is widly used as educational meterial, where students start from learning the operation procedures from program creation to runing, and learn various construction to perform execution and control of processes through practices.\n\nEvery time exercises along a theme are explained and students make programs.
