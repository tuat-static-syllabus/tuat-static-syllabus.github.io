The knowledge is about the role of each mechanical component, the required aspects, and the points to be considered for proper design. Students will be also exposed into the actual manufacturing process through short videos. Based on these basic knowledge, stress-stain analysis method will be introduced as general treatment. In this course, widely used and important mechanical components are focused, such as threads, gears, shafts, belts, brakes, dumpers, and bearings. Lubricants are also referred. As genera theoretical analysis method, Airy's stress function is introduced with a case study. As a proof of knowledge achievement, task report is requested at the end of the semester.\n\nFall semester in 2016, 90min/class x 2class/week,\nbut the schedule is fixed at the beginning of the semester.\n","expected_learning":"By the end of the course, students should be able to:\n1) classify properties of materials and materials for engineering use,\n2) analyze and synthesis engineering knowledge in design of engineering devices,\n3) convey the analysis results not only to team members but also to instructors,\n4) presenting the idea of project based on specific case study.","course_schedule":"Week1: Introduction of mechanical design\n1) basic functions of machines and significance of design\n2) basic knowledge of machinery (mathematical expression, pulley and lever)\n\nWeek2: Basic knowledge for service condition and endurance\n1) definition of stress and strain, stress-strain curve, and bending of beam\n2) fatigue behavior, and fatigue life prediction\n\nWeek3: Threads\n1) introduction of threads\n2) selection and consideration of threads\n\nWeek4: Gears\n1) introduction of gears\n2) selection and consideration of gears\n\nWeek5: Shafts, Shaft coupling, and Belts\n1) introduction of shafts, shaft couplings, and belts\n2) selection and consideration of shafts, shaft couplings, and belts\n\nWeek6: Lubricants\n1) introduction of lubricants\n2) selection consideration of lubricants\n\nWeek7: Brakes and Dumpers\n1) introduction of brakes and dumpers\n2) selection and consideration of brakes and dumpers\n\nWeek8: Bearings\n1) introduction of bearing\n2) selection and consideration of bearings\n\nWeek9: Introduction for stress function\n1) stress function derived from stress equilibrium in orthogonal coordinate system\n2) conversion to polar coordinate system\n\nWeek10: How to use stress function\n1) typical stress function and their fields\n2) case study of stress analysis","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Nothing.\nReference materials will be available by downloading after each class","assessment":"1) mini-quiz at each class (30%)\n2) contribution at each class (20%)\n3) final task report (50%)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Machine element, materials, bolts, shaft, shaft coupling, bearings, lubrication, gears, welding, fatigue, stress function","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/7/2017 4:38:36 PM","name":{"id":2611,"ja":"Mechanical Component Design","en":"Mechanical Component Design"},"instructor":{"id":1247,"ja":"池田 浩治, 未　　定","en":"IKEDA Koji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Wed.1,Thu.4","references":""}}
