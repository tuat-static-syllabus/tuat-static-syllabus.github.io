The spectroscopic analyses identifying the structure of organic compounds are indispensable means when we initiate the actual research and development. This course aims not only to understand principles of each spectroscopic method but also to have practices analyzing the series of spectra. This lecture will focus on \"proton-nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopic method.\" and develop abilities of students to rationally assign the structure of organic molecules based on the integrated information of the spectra (1)-(4).","expected_learning":"The students should understand basics of the above mentioned spectroscopic analyses and cultivate practical ability to identify the structure of organic molecules based on rational and integrated analysis of the spectroscopic methods involving (1) mass spectrometry, (2) infrared spectroscopy, (3) proton nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopic method, and (4) carbon-13 nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopic method.","course_schedule":"Session 1: Mass spectrometry (1)\nSession 2: Mass spectrometry (2)\nSession 3: Infrared spectroscopy (1)\nSession 4: Infrared spectroscopy (2)\nSession 5: Proton nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopic method (1)\nSession 6: Proton nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopic method (2)\nSession 7: Proton nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopic method (3)\nSession 8: Midterm Examination\nSession 9: Proton nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopic method (4)\nSession 10: Proton nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopic method (5)\nSession 11: Proton nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopic method (6)\nSession 12: Proton nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopic method (7)\nSession 13: Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic method (1)\nSession 14: Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic method (2)\nSession 15: Final Examination\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"1) Spectroscopic Methods in Organic Chemistry by M.
