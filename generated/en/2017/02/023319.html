Explain the concepts and the interaction of substances explained in biology, life science, and so on, to the words of physical chemistry as much as possible. We will also refer to reasonable movements linking cells, tissues and bodies, \"heart\" and \"pleasure\" sensation produced by \"soft materials\" by contact with people.","expected_learning":"1) What is the difference between life chemistry and artifacts as the nucleus of organic chemistry that started from the study of the material aspects of living things? 2) What is the essence of soft material that produces its own boldness on a daily basis? 3) Elements What are the characteristics of soft materials that lead to reductive life chemistry to total life science? 4) What is the substance / cause of deterioration of soft material accompanying time progression of organisms? 5) Anti - aging characteristics and relationship between body motion and soft material. 6) Do you know the difference in design principle between people and nonhuman beings (plants, animals / birds, microorganisms etc.) and artifacts? 7) Can you explain the life science base for life sustainability and human sustainability as a member of a sustainable society?","course_schedule":"※ Provide practical training to understand cellular systems and human (yourself) system (note that the classroom is different).
