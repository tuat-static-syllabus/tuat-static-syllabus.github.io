These topics range from Base technology to state-of-art one.\nIn the first half of the class, the area of AI which was studied actively in 1980s’ is shown. For example, search algorithms are the one of an important problem-solving technique, and can solve the particular problems based on the heuristics. Also, the knowledge representations and Logic can be learned from leading to Prolog.\nIn the second half of the class, the topics related to Natural Language Processing, Web Intelligence, and Software Agents are learned as explaining the algorithms and idea related to them.","expected_learning":"- Learning the whole knowledge related to AI\n- Learning the ability to generate the AI system","course_schedule":"(1st half of class: 1－7)\n- What’s AI?: History of AI, Turing Test, Learning Machine, AI and related area\n- Search and Problem Solving: State Space, Depth-first Search, Width-first Search, Recursion Algorithm, Best-first Search\n- AI with Game: Variety of Games, Game Tree, AND/OR Tree, min-max strategy, alpha-beta cutoff\n- Bio-Inspired Algorithm: Genetic Algorithm, Hill-Climbing, Simulated Annealing\n- Knowledge Representation: Semantic Network, Frame, Hierarchy, Inheritance, Relationship between Knowledge Representation and NLP\n- Predicate Logic: Propositional Logic, Predicate Logic, Resolution, Logical Reasoning\n\n（2nd half of class: 8-14）\n- Natural Language Processing: Corpus, thesaurus, Morphological Analysis, Statistical natural language processing, Document classification, Information Retrieval, Text Mining\n- Web Intelligence: Search Engine (Indexing, Ranking, Crawling), Community Formation (Complex Network), Recommendation System and Collective Intelligence, Web programing\n- Software Agent: What’s Agent?
