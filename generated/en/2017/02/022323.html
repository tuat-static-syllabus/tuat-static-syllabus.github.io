You will learn IR, NMR, and UV spectroscopies as analysis of organic compounds. To determine the molecular weight and grasp the thermal properties of polymeric compounds, you will also learn DTA and GPC. At part of “experiment of organic reaction and synthesis (organic chemistry I)”, Akiko OKAMOTO and Michiko MATSUMOTO will teach about organic reaction and synthetic experiments based on nucleophilic substitution (addition-elimination type reaction). Through this experiments, you will learn reaction behavior and chemical features of organic molecules. Furthermore, you will also learn basic technique for synthesis (e.g., liquid separation, distillation, and recrystallization) and how to handle reagents safely.\n","expected_learning":"The level of educational achievement\n[Analysis and identification]\nThe experiment class aims to understand the fundamentals of structure analysis and identification of organic compounds and polymers.\n[Organic reaction and synthesis (organic chemistry I)]\nThe experiment class aims to acquire how to handle apparatus and reagents safely and understand the concept of the organic reaction.\n","course_schedule":"Course Contents\n[Analysis and identification]\n1.
