Students study proteins and nucleotides, lipids, sugars during this lecture, and for understanding these subjects especially on metabolic pathways, combination of knowledge about such carbonyl compounds as amides, esters, aldehydes and amines and phosphonic acids are highly required. Thus, it is desirable for students to confirm issues already studied in previous lectures after having explanations at the class.","expected_learning":"Understand issues dealt with this lecture.","course_schedule":"At first as the last part of the successive organic chemistry lectures I to III, students study about syntheses, reactivities, and physical properties of amines. Then, on the basis of fundamental information of organic chemistry thus studies, lecture on biologically-related compounds is performed, and deeper understanding is attained about life science. Roughly speaking, the speed is usually 20-30 pages/lecture, and 7th (or 8th) and 15th would be the examination.","prerequisites":"It is desirable for students to have already studied about organic chemistry I to III.","texts_and_materials":"The textbook of Organic Chemistry by McMurry (8th Edition) is used for this lecture, and the corresponding study guide and student solution manual would be useful for students' self study.\n","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/2/2017 10:14:00 AM","name":{"id":614,"ja":"生体有機化学","en":"Bioorganic Chemistry"},"instructor":{"id":479,"ja":"齊藤 亜紀夫","en":"SAITO Akio"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":7,"min":2,"max":4},"neutral_department":"工学部","category":"工学部専門科目等","department":"","semester":"後学期","course_type":"後学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"","day_period":"木2","references":""}}
