Today, we often use numerical simulations to study natural phenomena and to design apparatuses. The computers are also strongly useful for the data analysis. Some software of numerical simulations are available commercially. Although there are many programming languages, basic ideas of the programming are the same. In this lecture, C language is used for studying those basic ideas and simulating physical phenomena.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1.
