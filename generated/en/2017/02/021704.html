In this course, we will learn the differentiations and the integrations of various functions of one variable and their properties. We will practice advanced computations in this course rather than in high schools.","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to master basic methods of the differentiations and the integrations of various functions, such as polynomials, rational and irrational\nfunctions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions,\n(2) to understand how to calculate extreme maximal and minimum values of functions, and\n(3) to be capable of performing practical computations on determining areas of figures and lengths of curves.","course_schedule":"1. Continuity of real numbers and limits of functions\n2. Continuity and differentiability\n3. Formulae of differentiations, inverse functions and their differentiations\n4. Differentiations of inverse trigonometric functions, high derivatives, and Leibniz’s theorem\n5. Rolle's theorem and the mean-value theorem\n6. Taylor's theorem, and its applications\n7. Exercises, or midterm examination\n8. Local maxima and minima, and limits of indeterminate forms\n9. Indefinite integrals\n10. Integrations of rational functions, possibly containing trigonometric functions\n11. Definite integrals, and their properties\n12. Improper integrals\n13. Areas of figures and lengths of curves\n14. Exercises of various problems on integrals\n15. Term examination\n\nA common examination will be conducted extra at the last of the term in the adjustment period for all the classes of this course.","prerequisites":"Mathematics in high schools (in particular, Mathematics I, II, III etc.) will be used in the lecture.","texts_and_materials":"Mogi Isamu, Yokote Ichiro, “Kiso-Bibun-Sekibun”, Syoka-bou (in Jananese)","assessment":"Exercise 26%, Midterm examination 24%, Term examination 50%","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Differentiation, Taylor expansion, Limit of indeterminate form, Integration of rational function, Improper integral","office_hours":"Before or After the class.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"H26(2014) S 39%, A 33%, B 24%, C 2%, D 2%\nH27(2015) S 2%, A 20%, B 45%, C 24%, D 9%\nH28(2016) S 2%, A 22%, B 43%, C 22%, D 10%","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/2/2017 11:17:37 AM","name":{"id":506,"ja":"微分積分学Ⅰおよび演習","en":"Calculus Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":544,"ja":"桧垣 優徳","en":"HIGAKI Masanori"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Wed.1～2","references":"Reference publications will be introduced in the first lecture, if necessary."}}
