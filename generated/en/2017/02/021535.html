For example, mechanical systems such as automobiles, electric appliances, trains, etc. are blending into our lives. Conversely, if there is no mechanical system, it may be difficult to keep current life. When we classify these machine systems roughly, they are divided into mechanical systems that generate, transmit or move power, and electronics that control them and exchange information with people. Regarding the former, we learn from lecture subjects in the field of mechanical engineering, whereas the latter is a learning content that has greatly advanced in academic fields of electrical engineering and electronic engineering. It can be said that the mechanical system has greatly developed through the fusion of these two disciplines.\nThose who are expected to grow as mechanical engineers of the future, please take subjects of electronics as the basis of mechatronics required in society.\n","expected_learning":"1)To understand an electric current and voltage of the direct-current circuit\n2) To understand the voltage, an electric current, and a phase of the AC circuit and to explain impedance\n3) To understand the operation of the semiconductor and to explain the characteristic of diode and transistor\n4) To explain the operation of op-amp circuit and to design the op-amp circuit for given equation\n","course_schedule":"Chapter 1 DC circuit\nLesson 1: With a review of Ohm's law and the Kirchhoff's law that you learned in a high school, we understand the essence that you did not learn in a high school while demonstrating.\n\nLesson 2: We study about a potential difference, a bridge circuit, the internal resistance of the power supply and also introduce an ideal power supply.\n\nLesson 3: We look the difference between DC and AC waveform and consider the RMS value with mathematical expression of AC signal. Moreover, we introduce that a calculation of the sine wave analysis is comfortable when we express it by a complex number vectors expression.\n\nChapter 2 AC circuit\nLesson 4: We learn a complex number and a complex plane, and reconfirm mathematical back ground on analyzing an AC circuit. In addition, we learn a resistance, a capacitor and inductor and study their response to AC signal.\n\nLesson 5: We learn the sign method, an element used for an AC circuit, and the method of analysis of the response of the circuit to AC voltage. In addition, we deepen the understanding to impedance by series and parallel circuit of combination with register and capacitor.\n\nLesson 6: We clarify the AC voltage response of RLC series and parallel circuits by an impedance calculation and we understand a resonance phenomenon by RLC components with a demonstration experiment.\n\nChapter 3 Semiconductor devices\nLesson 7 : We learn the behavior of electron and hall in the semiconductor and the structure and the kind of a characteristic of the diode and the transistor.\n\nLesson 8 : We understand the principle of the transistor by learning the voltage and current in a transistor and also the static characteristic of the transistor.\nLesson 9 : We understand characteristics and how to use a field effect transistor and light emitting diode.\n\nChapter 4 Operational amplifier\nLesson 11: We learn it about a property and analog handling of analog quantity technology to deal with in an electric circuit and understand a characteristic of the op-amp consisting of the differential amplifiers which particularly therefore are used, a theory.\n","prerequisites":"No prerequisites","texts_and_materials":"Original text at Coop book store","assessment":"S:up to 90%, A:89~80%, B:79~70%, C:69~60%","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"DC and AC signal, Kirchoff's law, impedance, semicondauctor, diode, trransistor, OP amplifier","office_hours":"Please contact by e-mail.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"3/17/2017 3:17:42 PM","name":{"id":553,"ja":"機械電子工学Ⅰ","en":"Electronics I"},"instructor":{"id":530,"ja":"梅田 倫弘","en":"UMEDA Norihiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":4,"min":1,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Prevention Research","office":"","day_period":"Thu.5","references":""}}
