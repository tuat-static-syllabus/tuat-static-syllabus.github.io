In this course, the notion of a vector space and a linear map between two vector spaces will be introduced. We will learn various basic properties of a basis and the dimension of a vector space, and the image and the kernel of a linear map. We will also learn about an eigenvalue and an eigenvector, for deep understanding of linear algebra.\n","expected_learning":"The goals of this course are\n(1) to understand vector spaces, linear maps, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, inner products and diagonalization, and\n(2) to be capable of performing their practical calculations.\n","course_schedule":"1.
