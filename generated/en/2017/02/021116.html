After learning the basic biochemistry, this lecture will help better and more profound understanding of the students.\nImportant view point is \"molecular level\", therefore knowledge and understanding of chemistry is very important.","course_schedule":"According to the text book \"Biochemistry (Stryer)\", The student will learn Capter 8-10 and 15-19. The important issues to be learned are as follows;\n1: Mechanism of enzyme reaction\n2: Strategy for catalytic reaction of enzyme\n3: Strategy for control of enzyme fucntion\n4: Total view of metabolism\n5: Glycolysis and glyconeogenesis\n6: Citric cycle\n7: Oxydative phosphorylation\n8: Photosynthesis","prerequisites":"To better understanding, it is recommended to take the lecture of \"Basic phycics\", \"Basic Chemistry\" and \"Basic biology\".
