The cell activities are important to maintain life, those contain taking nutrition, excretion of wastes, intracellular metabolism and cell-cell communication. Those phenomena are able to understand by chemistry. In this lecture, the basic 4 contents of the cell are learned. These are Amino acids, Carbohydrates, Lipids and Nucleic acids. Those maybe help to understand the cell and life.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this lecture will be able to\n1.Know the basic Taxonomy of life\n2.Understand the 4 kinds of biomolecules to form the cell\n3.Notice the importance of chemistry for understanding life\nReview the lecture as soon as possible is important to understand this subject rather than preparation.","course_schedule":"1st lecture ( Apr. 12 ): Guidance about this lecture, Organismal Evolution ( Taxonomy & Phylogeny ), Cellular architecture ( Prokaryotes )\n2nd lecture ( Apr. 19 ): Cellular architecture ( Eukaryotes ), Water ( Physical properties & Chemical properties )\n3rd lecture ( Apr. 26 ): Guidance about Biomolecules ( 4 kinds ), Chemistry of Amino acids ( General properties, Structures, Characterisitics and Stereochemistry )\n4th lecture ( May 10 ): Chemistry of Amino acids ( Derivatives ), Chemistry of Proteins ( Primary structure & Secondary structure )\n5th lecture ( May 17 ): Chemistry of Proteins ( Tertiary structure, Quatenary structure & Protein purification and analysis )\n6th lecture ( May 20 ): Chemistry of Carbohydrates ( Classification, Configuration and Conformation of Monosaccharides )\n7th lecture ( May 24 ): Chemistry of Carbohydrates ( Sugar derivatives and Disaccharides )\n8th lecture ( May 31 ): Midsemester examination\n9th lecture ( Jun. 7 ): Chemistry of Carbohydrates ( Structure & Character of Polysaccharides )\n10th lecture ( Jun. 14 ): Chemistry of Lipids ( Classification, Fatty acids and Triacylglycerol )\n11th lecture ( Jun. 21 ): Chemistry of Lipids ( Glycerophospholipids, Sphingolipids, Steroids and Fat-soluble vitamins )\n12th lecture ( Jun. 28 ): Chemistry of Lipids ( Lipid bilayers ), Chemistry of Nucleic acids ( Structure of Nucleotids & Nucleic acids )\n13th lecture ( Jul. 5 ): Chemistry of Nucleic acids ( DNA helix & Character of double-stranded DNA )\n14th lecture ( Jul. 12 ): Chemistry of Nucleic acids ( of the central dogma & DNA replication )\n15th lecture ( Jul. 19 ): Final exams\nThis program is tentative plan.
