This class mainly deals with ionic reactions, which involves only 2 controlling factors; polarity of bonds depending on electron negativities, and steric factor of the molecules. These bond cleaving and forming reactions are governed by removal of electrons. Therefore, this field of chemistry is constructed by very simple elemental factors. I believe that the key point for perfect understanding of this field is that you think about the reaction as if you were the reactant molecule. I will give a lecture described below and I hope you will enjoy the organic chemistry in this class.\n\nLecture 1: opening talk: how to understand organic reactions.\nLecture 2: synthesis of alcohols and thiols.\nLecture 3: synthesis of alcohols and thiols.\nLecture 4: ethers, epoxides and sulfides.\nLecture 5: aldehyde and ketons.\nLecture 6: aldehyde and ketons.\nLecture 7: intermediate exam.\nLecture 8: carbonic acids.\nLecture 9: carbonyl compounds and nucleophilic acylations.\nLecture 10: carbonyl compounds and nucleophilic acylations.\nLecture 11: alpha substitution reactions of carbonyl compounds.\nLecture 12: alpha substitution reactions of carbonyl compounds.\nLecture 13: carbonyl condensations.\nLecture 14: pretest for final exam.
