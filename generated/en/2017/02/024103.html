The students will be evaluated by their understanding of the research background, performance presentation and capability to answer the questions scientifically.\nOhno Laboratory / Nakamura Laboratory: The students should make a brief introduction of the most recent paper on 1) the development and evaluation of media for the electrochemical devices, 2) the state analysis of the biopolymer in media, and 3) the improvement or development of analytical tools on interfacial reaction.\nNagasawa Laboratory: The students will introduce two papers from J. Am. Chem. Soc., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., ChemBioChem, etc. per week, and discuss the contents of the papers. The students will also read the reference books related to organic synthesis, such as Classics in Total Synthesis, in turn by answering questions scientifically.\nSakurai Laboratory: The students will learn to read and discuss the English scientific papers in the field of organic synthesis of derivatives of biological molecules and chemical biology.\nYohda and Noguchi Laboratory: The students will learn to read and understand the English scientific papers related to the cutting-edge researches on biotechnology. The students will be trained to obtain the English ability and knowledge on biotechnology.\nMachida, Nakamura and Nakamura Laboratory: The students will participate in two types of lab activities. The one is the weekly data discussion which is focusing on their research progress. The students in certain group will present their recent data every two weeks. The other lab activity is the seminar which will be carried out at the same time with the data discussion. The students will introduce the most recent research paper closely related to their research themes.","prerequisites":"The student must be the member of corresponding laboratory.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"The students will be evaluated by the attendance, presentation and performance on discussion.","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/16/2017 6:35:15 PM","name":{"id":861,"ja":"応用生物工学演習Ⅰ","en":"Seminar for Biotechnology Ⅰ"},"instructor":{"id":573,"ja":"川野 竜司","en":"KAWANO Ryuji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":10,"min":4,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Research","references":""}}
