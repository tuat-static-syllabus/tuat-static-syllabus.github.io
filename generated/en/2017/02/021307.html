In order to discard this preconception, it is strongly recommended that student understand (not memorize) the basic concepts about chemical bonds, molecular shapes, and chemical reactions.","expected_learning":"As this lecture is considered to be the introductory course of organic chemistry, which is a basic subject to learn organic material science, basic principles should be learned.","course_schedule":"#1-#3 Chapter 1 “Structure and Bonding in Organic Molecules”, main topics; chemical bonds, atomic orbital, molecular orbital, molecular shapes\n\n#4, #5 Chapter 2, “Structure and Reactivity: acid and base, polar and nonpolar molecules”, main topics; kinetic control and thermodynamic control, acid and base, electrophile and nucleophile, functional group, straight-chain alkane and branched alkane, structure, structure and nomenclature of alkane, physical properties of alkane, conformation and conformer.\n\n#6, #7 Chapter 3, “Reactions of Alkanes: bond-dissociation energy, Radical Halogenation, and Reactivity”, main topics; strength of alkane bond, radicals, structure of alkyl radicals, hyper-conjugation, cracking of petroleum, chlorination of methane, chlorination of higher alkanes, relative reactivity and selectivity, synthetic radical halogenation, combustion of alkane, freon\n\n#8 Chapter 4: “Cycloalkane”, main topics; nomenclature of cycloalkane, ring strain and structure of cycloalkanes, conformation of cyclohexane, larger cycloalkanes, polycyclic alkanes, carbocyclic products in nature\n\n#9 Midterm examination\n\n#10, #11 Chapter 5, “Stereoisomers”, main topics; chirality, optical activity, absolute configuration, R-S sequence rules, Fischer projections, diastereomers, meso compounds, separation of enamtiomers.\n\n#12-#14 Chapter 6, “Properties and Reactions of Haloalkanes: Bimolecular Nucleophilic Substitution”, main topics, nucleophilic substitution reactions, electron pushing arrows, mechanism, kinetics, stereochemistry, inversion of configuration, relationships between structures and reactivity (leaving groups, nucleophiles, alkyl groups)\n\n#15 Term-end examination\n","prerequisites":"Review Organic Chemistry in high school.
