Understand from the substance foundation of adaptation that enables life environment, the society that lives in reality, the chemical substances and biopolymers adopted by life, the relationship between functions generated by substances and mutual relationships, efforts and learning . Instead of departing from a pathological condition, think about health as a foundation for dynamic life. Through these lectures, we constantly create new things in the coming artificial intelligence society, master the living human beings living while continuing to change, and conceive ideas for material and material design that will contribute to the creation of human figures from the principles of life science (chemical) do that for me. In addition to lectures for basic learning, including practical elements such as group discussion, presentation using PowerPoint, experiments and practice as exercises.","expected_learning":"1) Do you know the structure and function of the compounds that make up the unit of life \"cells\", and the material chemistry base of the moving body?\n？ 2) Do you know the concept and design strategy of the living system foundation of cells and individuals that are the foundation of life? Do you know the position of people in the life (cell) lineage?\n3) Do you know the deterioration of life and biomaterials (declining function by time: eg aging and fatigue, diseases, especially lifestyle diseases), cause of exhaustion and prevention guidelines?\n4) Do you know the difference in the design principle of people and non-human creatures and artifacts?\n5) Can you explain the life science base for life sustainability and human sustainability as a member of a sustainable society?","course_schedule":"In the lecture, we will practice to understand the system of cells and humans (yourself) (note that the place of class is different).
