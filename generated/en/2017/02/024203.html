The research theme is determined after consultation with laboratory’s professor. Students must do poster presentation as a progress report in the beginning of October and do oral presentation (for 7 min) as a final report in the middle of February. Furthermore, the graduation thesis for submission will be required.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n1) do parts of studies in their affiliate laboratory\n2) give a presentation for the results of the research.\n","course_schedule":"[from April] Learners start to do their studies for graduation in their affiliate laboratory (The assigned laboratory is usually decided in the middle of December from the end of November of third-year. Research fields include “Organic Chemistry”, “Opto-electronic Materials”, “Energy Chemistry & Electrochemistry”, “Molecular Design”, “Molecular Catalysis”, and “Inorganic Solid State Chemistry”). The research theme is determined after consultation with laboratory’s professor. Their studies are carried out through discussion with professors and instructors as well as literature investigation. In addition, learners will learn the operation procedures of various apparatuses in each laboratory to use their apparatuses in accomplishing studies. It is required to handle their apparatuses very carefully, because the breakdown of their apparatuses by the wrong use will give other researchers a big trouble.\n[Early October] Learners give a poster presentation around an hour as a progress report. At this time, each person must explain each study purposes and results for the staff, graduate students, and third-year students.
