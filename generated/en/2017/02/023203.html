Aim: Many useful bioactive and functional organic compounds are known. In order to understand the role of these compounds and synthesize complex organic molecules, we need to study the reactivity of organic molecules. The aim of this course is to summarize organic reactions from the perspective of reaction mechanism, and learn the application of organic reactions to organic synthesis.\n\nb. Outline: A variety of organic reactions are classified in to several reaction patterns. In this lecture, first how to understand organic reactions is expounded. Next the classification of organic reactions by their patterns and their application to organic synthesis are discussed.\n","expected_learning":"To understand the characteristic features of each organic reaction and how they can be employed for organic synthesis.","course_schedule":"1.-3. Pericyclic reactions: Pericyclic reactions, concerted reactions,\nelectrocyclic reactions, cycloaddition reactions, and\nsigmatropic reactions are explained on the basis of frontier\norbital theory.\n4. Retrosynthesis: Concept of retrosynthesis, which is useful for\nmulti-step synthesis, is expounded.\n5.-6. Introduction of substituents to aromatic nuclei by electrophilic\naromatic substitution: Reactivity and orientation of substituted\nbenzenes, order of functional group transformations, and\nintroduction and removal of activation and protecting groups are\nexplained.\n6.-7. Preparation and alkylation of carbanions: Classification of\ncarbanions and their preparation, alkylation of organocopper\nreagents, acetylides, and active methylen compounds are\ndiscussed.\n8. Midterm examination\n9.-10. Aldol-type reactions and acylation: Application of aldol-type\nreactions, such as the Claisen-Schmidt reaction and Perkin\ncondensation, and acylation such as the Claisen condensation are\nexplained.\n10.-11. 1,4-Addition of carbanions: The Michael reaction, 1,4-addition\nof organocopper reagents and enamines are expounded. Application\nof these reactions to the Robinson annulations is also\ndiscussed.\n12.-13. Construction of carbocycles: Irreversible reactions for the\npreparation of three- and four-membered rings and reversible\nreactions for the preparation of five- and six-membered rings\nare explained.\n13.-14. Analysis of total synthetic schemes: Analysis of total synthetic\nschemes will lead to study how a variety of organic synthetic\nmethods are applied.\n15.
