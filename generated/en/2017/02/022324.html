This characteristic to make long linear chains is called “catenation” and it is not allowed only by replacing C with Si. Such specific freedom to make various chemical linkages enforced us to learn “Carbon Chemistry = Organic Chemistry” apart from other fields of chemistry, as it contents are so enormous. During the study constant feedback of Exercise to your homework becomes necessary in order to deepen your comprehension.","expected_learning":"The objective of this exercise class, Organic Chemistry Exercise I, is to establish the study on the fundamental principles of O.C.I, as one of the classes of basic chemistries in University.","course_schedule":"A short test will be practiced in every 1st half of the class, of which contents are related to the latest classes of Organic Chemistry I, II, partially III. The explanation of the short test or practice to solve questions in the chapter end of the text will be presented in the latter half.","prerequisites":"O.C.I and Introduction to Chemical Bonding opened in the same semester should be taken. Reviewing and full comprehension of high school chemistry is primarily demand.","texts_and_materials":"Throughout Organic Chemistry I, II, III, IV, V and exercise classes I and II,\nOrganic Chemistry\nStructure and Function 7th edition\nPeter Vollhardt, Neil E. Schore\nISBN: 978-1464120275","assessment":"Evaluation will be settled by the end-term examination.","message_from_instructor":"【attention!】Do not mix “memorize” and “comprehend”. Subject naming (according to IUPAC rules)―memorize, chemical reactions―comprehend. Nobody memorizes a great numbers of reaction schemes (Even Instructors really do not!). Your memory bank is not almighty to O.C., especially beyond the high school chemistry. Better to reconstruct the tactics and strategy of your way of study. There is no royal road !\nSometimes calculative examinations are presented even in Organic Chemistry, therefore, carrying a calculator is basic for the students.\n","course_keywords":"Stucture and chemical bonds, chemical reactivity, reaction of alkanes, stereoisomer, reaction of haloalkanes","office_hours":"Every Thursday/Friday 17-19 o’clock, but, better to make an appointment by e-mail or TEL. Questions by e-mail is acceptable.","remarks_1":"Grading of Studying persistently is the most important.
