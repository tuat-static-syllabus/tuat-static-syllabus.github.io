The winners of Nobel prize in chemistry in 2013 are working on this field. Today people think that chemistry is not only discussed from experiments but also theoretical simulations. In this lecture, I introduce quantum mechanics, an important rule for small particles and also basics in theoretical chemistry. We will consider how the quantum mechanics is used for chemical problems. Major discussions in chemistry are based on molecular electronic states. We will solve the Schrodinger equation for the electrons in atoms or molecules by hand or using a computer, which will help you to understand the theoretical chemistry world more deeply. I expect learners already have enough knowledge for classical mechanics in high school.","expected_learning":"Learners will understand the following points.\n(1) roles of theoretical chemistry\n(2) basic knowledge of quantum mechanics\n(3) electronic structure of atoms\n(4) electronic structure of molecules\n","course_schedule":"In the beginning of each lecture, you have a small examination and you need to study beforehand every week. The problems and answers are opened in the internet. This course includes not only the lectures by the lecturer, but also includes discussions and presentations by students, experiments using a computer, and solving mathematical or physical-chemistry problems by hand. You need a mathematical calculator (or similar equipment, such as a smartphone). The lecturer will demonstrate some calculations using computational programs called Gaussian and Maple.\n1st week:　Why you go to University? Why you take “Basic Science”?\n2nd week: Self-introduction, How many molecules are there in the world?\n3rd week: Introduction of Gaussian, How to get money?\n4th week: What is matter? What is light?\n5th week: Nature of light and electron\n6th week: Bohr model\n7th week: Overview, mathematical explanation of partial differentiation\n8th week: Derivation of Schrodinger equation, nature of wave function\n9th week: one-dimensional square well potential problem\n10th week: two and three-dimensional square well potential problem\n11th week: Schrodinger equation of Hydrogen atom\n12th week: Schrodinger equation of Hydrogen atom, mathematical software\n13th week: Multi-electronic atoms, electron configuration, spin\n14th week:H2+ molecule, Linear combination of atomic orbital (LCAO)\n15th week: Overview, question and comments, discussion\n","prerequisites":"Students entering this course are expected to have enough knowledge of physics (especially classical mechanics and wave function) at high-school level.","texts_and_materials":"Japanese text written by Nakata Munetaka “Ryoshi Kagaku Kihon no Kangaekata”","assessment":"Attitudes and small examinations (40%), three times reports (20% in each report) Late-coming more than 15 minutes corresponds to an absence of the class.
