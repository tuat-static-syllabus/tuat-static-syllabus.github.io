The topics covered are the properties of electromagnetic field and plane electromagnetic waves in a vacuum. Some mathematical technics that vector algebra, solving a differential equation, etc., are required. The knowledge of electromagnetism in this course will be essential for the scientists and engineers.","expected_learning":"Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:\n1. describe the force on a charged particle that moves in the static magnetic field\n2. describe the magnetic field induced by the static electric current\n3. describe the electric voltage induced by the time-dependent magnetic field\n4. estimate the inductance of coil\n5. describe the electric current in RLC circuit using a differential equation on the charge\n6. describe a wave equation from the Maxwell’s equation in vacuum.\n","course_schedule":"1st week: Review of Electromagnetism\n2nd week: Force on charged particle that moves in a magnetic field\n3rd week: Magnetic field by the static electric current (Biot-Savart Law)\n4th week: Gauss’s Law, Ampere’s Law\n5th week: Electromagnetic induction (Faraday’s Law)\n6th week: Electromagnetic induction (Lenz’s Law)\n7th week: Self and Mutual Inductance\n8th week: 1st examination\n9th week: RLC electric circuit\n10th week: Displacement current\n11th week: Maxwell’s equation\n12th week: Wave equation derived from the Maxwell’s equation\n13th week: Development of electromagnetic wave\n14th week: Electromagnetic wave in a material\n15th week: 2nd examination\n","prerequisites":"Electromagnetism (1212)","texts_and_materials":"See reference publication.","assessment":"Two 90-min examinations will be given, and the each is worth 50% of your grade.","message_from_instructor":"Mastering the skills of understanding, describing, and explaining some electromagnetic phenomena will provide the basic way of logical thinking required in engineering field.","course_keywords":"Magnetic field, Electromagnetic Induction, Maxwell’s equation","office_hours":"After each lesson or via e-mail.","remarks_1":"A problem-solving provided as homework is effective in understanding the electromagnetic phenomena.
