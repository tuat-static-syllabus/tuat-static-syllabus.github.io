Quantum mechanics was once mostly of interest to physicists, chemists and other basic scientists. Now the concepts and techniques of quantum mechanics are essential in many areas of engineering and science such as materials science, nanotechnology, electronic devices, and photonics. This course is a substantial introduction to quantum mechanics and how to use it. It is specifically designed to be accessible not only to physicists but also to students and technical professionals over a wide range of science and engineering backgrounds.","expected_learning":"After completing this course the students should be able to explain the following topics:\nphotoelectric effect, Compton scattering, photons, Franck-Hertz experiment, the Bohr atom, electron diffraction, de Broglie waves, and the wave-particle duality of matter and light.\nIntroduction to wave mechanics: Schrodinger's equation, wave functions, wave packets, probability amplitudes, stationary states, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and zero-point energies.\nSolutions to Schrodinger's equation in one dimension: transmission and reflection at a barrier, barrier penetration, potential wells, the simple harmonic oscillator.\nSchrodinger's equation in three dimensions: central potentials and introduction to hydrogenic systems.","course_schedule":"TBA","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"TBA","assessment":"Midterm Exam: 0%\nFinal Exam: 80%\nHomework: 10%\nQuizzes: 10%","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://web.tuat.ac.jp/~nanotech/index.htm","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/23/2017 2:26:41 PM","name":{"id":583,"ja":"量子力学概論","en":"Introduction to Quantum Dynamics"},"instructor":{"id":548,"ja":"白樫 淳一","en":"SHIRAKASHI Junichi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":9,"min":3,"max":4},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Engineering","category":"technology speciality courses,ets.","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering","office":"","day_period":"Thu.2","references":""}}
