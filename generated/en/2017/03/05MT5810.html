For this purpose, it is necessary to understand agricultural production in relation to environmental conditions, agro-ecosystems, and its hierarchical structures at multiple spatio-temporal scales. This lecture aims to provide basic information for the conservation and sustainable management of water environment including rivers, streams and agricultural canals based on some guidelines published by the Japanese government. Advanced techniques for sensing, monitoring and numerical simulations will also be introduced.","expected_learning":"Students are expected to learn:\n-Structure of agricultural and rural environment at multiple scales,\n-Guidelines for river works and farmland consolidation for improved agricultural production in harmony with nature, and\n-advanced ecohydraulic monitoring and modelling as well as assessment based on such information.\n","course_schedule":"1: Guideline for nature-like river works (1)\n2: Guideline for nature-like river works (2)\n3: Guideline for farmland consolidation in harmony with nature (1)\n4: Guideline for farmland consolidation in harmony with nature (2)\n5: Advanced monitoring and modelling of water environment (1)\n6: Advanced monitoring and modelling of water environment (2)\n7: Modelling and assessment for water environment conservation (presentation)\n\nThe lecture is schedule as listed below.\nJune 12: Topics 1 & 2\nJune 19: Topics 3 & 4\nJune 26: Topics 5 & 6\nJuly 3: Topic 7\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Provided in the lecture","assessment":"Assessment will be done based on attendance, discussion, report and presentation in the lecture.","message_from_instructor":"Ecohydraulics is a fantastic topic to learn.","course_keywords":"ecohydraulics, water resources, irrigation and drainage systems, aquatic ecosystems, mathematical model","office_hours":"Wednesday, 16:30-17:30","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/28/2017 2:36:28 PM","name":{"id":1135,"ja":"水環境保全学特論","en":"Advanced Water Environment Conservation"},"instructor":{"id":825,"ja":"福田 信二","en":"FUKUDA Shinji"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"Bld. 3, Room 311","day_period":"Mon.4","references":"Provided in the lecture"}}
