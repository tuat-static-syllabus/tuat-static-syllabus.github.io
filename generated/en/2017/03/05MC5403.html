With the decisive handicap, plants have survived over the years because they have high abilities to adapt well to various environmental changes. Several small molecules “plant hormones” function as main players for the adaptation, which will be focused on the lecture.","expected_learning":"1. You can roughly understand the mode of action for each hormone.\n2. You can understand the chemical structure necessary for the action of each hormone.\n3. You can imagine the biosynthesis and signal perception of functional substances in plants.\n","course_schedule":"【Day 1】\n　1. Signal transduction of phytohormones (1):　ethylene\n　2. Signal transduction of phytohormones (2):　cytokinin\n　3. Signal transduction of phytohormones (3):　brassinosteroid\n　4. Signal transduction of phytohormones (4):　auxin・jasmonate\n【Day 2】\n　5. Signal transduction of phytohormones (5):　abscisic acid\n　6. Signal transduction of phytohormones (6):　gibberellin\n　7. Signal transduction of phytohormones (7):　storigolaction\n　8. General discussion\n","prerequisites":"I hope everyone listens to my voice on both two days.","texts_and_materials":"A handout will be put before starting a lecture.","assessment":"It will be done based on the attendance status and the responses to my questions.","message_from_instructor":"So-called “hormones” exist not only in animals but also in plants. I’ll give a short talk as simply as possible so that everyone unfamiliar with the hormones should be able to understand them. I hope you don’t miss the opportunity to know the smart abilities of plants.","course_keywords":"Phytohormone, Biosynthesis, Receptor, Metabolism, Signal transduction","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/28/2017 7:14:47 PM","name":{"id":918,"ja":"生物制御科学特論Ⅲ","en":"Special Lecture on Bioregulation and Biointeraction Ⅲ"},"instructor":{"id":763,"ja":"中嶋 正敏, 川出 洋","en":"NAKAJIMA Masatoshi, KAWAIDE Hiroshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Agriculture(Master)","category":"common courses","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Not required"}}
