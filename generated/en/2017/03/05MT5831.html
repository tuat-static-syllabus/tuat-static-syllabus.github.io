With clear explanations of chaos theory and principles, the first part of the course offers some basic facts, the fundamental terminology, and the concepts of deterministic chaos.\n\nThe second part of this course demonstraes rich applications of the theory as applied to real agricultural systems. Applications include a wide area such as alternate bearing in tree crops, weed control and tillage, nonlinear vibrations in agricultural tractors, and piglet pricing analysis.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"1.
