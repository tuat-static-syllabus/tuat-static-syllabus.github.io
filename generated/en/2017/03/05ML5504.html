The glycan affects property and function of protein and plays the important role in recognition of cell-cell or cell-molecule interaction. The glycosylation is a posttranslational modification and is successive reaction to which monosaccharide is added by each specific glycosyltransferases. Thus, the glycosylation is susceptible to various factors from environment, aging and etc. In this lecture, I will review from the basics of glycosylation to the diseases by abnormal glycosylation.\n\n“Basic Neuroscience” (ENDO, Shogo)\nMemory, the product of our brain, supports our behaviors to yield our social activities. The revelation of brain functions is to understand the mankind, and it leads to the understanding the mechanisms underlying our society and a variety of production activities. In this lecture, I will focus on “Memory” which is an essential basis for other higher brain functions. First, I will talk on the brain and the nervous system for the memory storage device. Then, I will discuss how Memory involves in our behaviors and our society.\n","expected_learning":"“Glycosylation and Disease” (MANYA, Hiroshi)\n1) Understand the basics of glycobiology\n2) Learn the importance of biological function of glycosylation\n\n“Basic Neuroscience” (ENDO, Shogo)\n1) Understand terms for neuroscience\n2) Able to describe the neuronal system underlying memory\n3) Comprehend a variety of memory and the higher brain functions supported by them\n","course_schedule":"\n“Glycosylation and Disease” (MANYA, Hiroshi)\n1) Basic of glycobiology\n2) Biosynthesis of glycan\n3) Function of glycan\n4) Abnormal glycosylation and Disease\nI will illustrate the basic of glycobiology, the approach to glycobiology and the relation between abnormal glycosylation and disease with introduction of my study on glycosylation and aging.\n\n“Basic Neuroscience” (ENDO, Shogo)\n1) What is a brain and a neuron?\n2) Classification and basics for memory\n3) Memory and social behaviors\n4) Aging and memory\nFurther, I would like to talk on the widely accepted misunderstanding on the memory and brain functions.
