The metabolic disease, such as ascites and fat liver, has been accompanied by fat deposition. According to these aspects, I have studied the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism in chickens for the production of high quality meat with less fat, i.e. (1) Effective manipulation of fatness chickens, (2) Characterization of cholesterol metabolism in chickens, (3) Development of chicken oocyte ?the production of designer eggs-, and (4) Identification of regulatory molecule in chicken species-specific glucose metabolism.\nThis lecture introduces our previous studies on molecular nutrition in farm animals and will discuss the further studies for animal productions.\n","expected_learning":"Resent animal nutrition will be understood in lecture.","course_schedule":"１．Molecular nutrition\n２．The specific examples to utilize the molecular nutrition\n３．Further discussion\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided in class.","assessment":"Based on report.","message_from_instructor":"Let’s discuss the interactions of Nutrition-Physiology-Gene in farm animals.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/22/2017 11:06:30 AM","name":{"id":1078,"ja":"畜産学特論","en":"Advanced Animal Science"},"instructor":{"id":811,"ja":"佐藤 幹, 新村 毅","en":"SATO Kan, SHIMMURA Tsuyoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学府","category":"","department":"","semester":"前学期","course_type":"前学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"","day_period":"水1","references":"To be announced in the lectures."}}
