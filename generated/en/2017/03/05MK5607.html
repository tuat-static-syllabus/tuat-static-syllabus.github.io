Specifically, up-to-date information on the effects of gaseous air pollutants, acid deposition and aerosol (particulate matter) on crops and trees and its mechanisms will be introduced and explained.\n\n1) Effects of photochemical oxidants (ozone) on plants\nThe effects of photochemical oxidants (ozone) on growth and physiological functions such as photosynthesis on crops and trees, and its mechanisms will be explained. Furthermore, critical levels of ozone for protecting crops and trees will be introduced and explained.\n\n2) Effects of acid deposition on trees\nThe effects of acid rain, soil acidification and excessive nitrogen load from the atmosphere on growth, physiological functions such as photosynthesis and nutrient status of trees, and its mechanisms will be explained.\n\n3) Effects of aerosol (fine particulate matter, PM2.5) on trees\nThe effects of aerosol (particulate matter) on growth and physiological functions such as photosynthesis of trees, and its mechanisms will be explained.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding of the growth and physiological functions such as photosynthesis and its measurements.
