Each year there are more conservation problems, more solutions with development of newly skills. In this lecture, we target mammal conservation/management, especially by understanding of topics focused at outside/inside of Japan. The lectures aim at understanding of concepts and terms of animal ecology, such as zoogeography, evolution, social behaviour, and population. Based on the fundamental science, the lectures focus on applied components in conservation. The students must develop discussion/presentation skills of current hot topics in small groups.","expected_learning":"The lectures aim at understanding of concepts and terms of animal ecology, such as zoogeography, evolution, social behaviour, and population.
