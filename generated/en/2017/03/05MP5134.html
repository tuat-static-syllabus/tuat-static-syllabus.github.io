In this lecture, we will discuss the topics on horticulture from ecological, physiological, and molecular biological point of view. We will introduce overviews of the habitat, structure and morphogenesis of horticultural crops, physiology of flowering, fruit development and maturation, biochemical basis for biosynthesis of functional compounds, plant responses to temperature and other environments, and the techniques that constitute the plant factory system for crop production. We will also discuss our contribution to reconstruction support for Tohoku disaster area.","expected_learning":"1. To understand the basic body structure of horticultural crops,\n2.
