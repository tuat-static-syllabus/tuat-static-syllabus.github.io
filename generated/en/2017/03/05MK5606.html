As microornanisms can decompose various toxic compounds, new microorganisms are isolated from the natural environments, and their utilization is attempted for the restoration of contaminated environment. This course will introduce a spectrum of latest information on research techniques, classification and identification of bacteria, and analytical techniques for microbial population.","expected_learning":"Understanding the characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms.\nUnderstanding internationally applicable knowledge on bacterial classification and identification.\nUnderstanding methodologies analyzing unknown microbes based on the genome information.\n","course_schedule":"1st　History of research on microorganisms\n2nd　Methods for observing microorganisms\n3rd　Bacterial taxonomy\n4th Bacterial chemotaxonomy\n5th　Taxonomy based on genomic information\n6th　Proposal of novel bacterial species\n7th　Description of species in papers\n8th　Microbial population dynamics-1\n9th　Microbial population dynamics-2\n10th　Microbial population dynamics-3\n11th　Microbial population dynamics-4\n12th　Presentation by student-1\n13th　Presentation by student-2\n14th　Presentation by student-3\n15th　Checkup and confirmation of learned contents\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Evaluation will be based on mini-reports required weekly to check the level of understanding (20%), contents of presentations (30%) and reports (50%).","message_from_instructor":"I will try to design my lectures to be adaptable to different backgrounds of the students.
