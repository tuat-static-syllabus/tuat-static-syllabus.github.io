Learn about how to present appropriate graphs and tables in scientific papers.\n\nThe handout (e.g., slide) will be distributed before each lesson. It is desirable to prepare the summary of lessons. In each coursework, I will give some assignment to check learning contexts. After the ends of all lectures, I will request a report written in the form of a scientific paper.\n","prerequisites":"Understanding mathematics provided at Japanese high school.","texts_and_materials":"Handout will be arbitrarily provided.","assessment":"Attendance: 10%, assignment of each course work: 70%, report: 20%\n【2015】S:40%, A:40%, B:4%, C:4%, D:12%, E:0%\n","message_from_instructor":"One of the goals of this class is getting skills for conducting Generalized Linear Model (GLM) by using statistical software R.","course_keywords":"Statistical literacy, data literacy, programing, statistical modelling","office_hours":"Before and after of each lesson.
