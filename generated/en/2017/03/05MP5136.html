Many factors, such as receptors, G-protein, protein kinase and transcriptional factors, play important roles in these process. In this lecture, the functions of these factors and signal transduction in plant cells are explained using data of the recent articles. In addition, the　technical principle in the field of molecular biology and biochemistry is introduced.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand the meaning of data provided by biochemical and molecular biological analysis.","course_schedule":"The following is main contents of this lecture.\n\n1.
