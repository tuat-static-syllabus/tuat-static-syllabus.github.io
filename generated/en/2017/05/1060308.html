Purpose: One of the keywords in science and technology in the 21st century is nanotechnology. The world of nanometers is far from being to say never say so. For example, in our body ultimately the organization is functioning by nano level. The great advancement of nanotechnology has come to be able to see nano. In this lecture, in order to overlook the world of nanotechnology vertically and horizontally, learning basic knowledge and applied technology with the core theme of technology that can see nano. It aims to acquire insight and ability to see the essence of nanotechnology.\n\nB. Summary: In this lecture, we focus on understanding the imaging technology in nanotechnology. Specifically, we understand the fundamentals and applications of the scanning probe microscope devised to overcome the resolution limit of conventional microscopes, atomic force microscope, magnetic force / electrostatic force microscope, near-field optical microscope. We also introduce the latest microscope.","expected_learning":"1) To understand that the diffraction phenomenon which is the fundamental property of light and the resolution limit of the optical microscope are determined by diffraction.\n2) To understand the basic structure of the scanning probe microscope, the necessary mechanism and the observation mode for controlling the probe.\n3) To understand the basic structure of atomic force microscope and understand its resolution limit.\n4) To understand the basic structure of near-field optical microscope and know characteristics not found in other scanning probe microscope.","course_schedule":"1)Visualization technology in nanotechnology\n2)To U\\understand diffraction phenomenon and imaging system diffraction: Huygens-Fresnel's principle, Abbe's condition, Rayleigh's resolution\n3)Optical imaging system, phase object, optical transfer function, Seidel's 5 aberrations\n4)Principle of microscopic optical imaging, element for determining resolution (diffraction phenomenon), required lens performance\n5)Fundamentals and design of precision mechanism Ⅰ, Elasticity theory, kinematics of beams, anti-vibration mechanism\n6)Basic and design of precision mechanism Ⅱ, Flexure, parallel spring mechanism, friction and backlash, force measurement method\n7)Basics of Scanning Probe Microscope Ⅰ, Basic Structure, Required Basic Mechanism\n8)Basics of scanning probe microscope Ⅱ, SPM control and observation mode, resolution, quantum mechanics and tunnel effect, image processing\n9)Atomic Force Microscope Ⅰ, Light Lever, Surface Interaction, Force Curve, Three Measurement Modes\n10)Atomic force microscope Ⅱ, friction force detection mode, friction force detection sensitivity, lateral vibration\n11)Atomic force microscope Ⅲ, concept of sophistication by MEMS technology, horizontal force sensitivity, hysteresis\n12)Near-field optical microscope Ⅰ, Evanescent field and optical near-field theory, observation mode\n13)Near-field optical microscope Ⅱ, Various mechanical parts, probes, light sources,and detectors\n14)New microscope, plasmonic microscope, magnetic force microscope, and electrostatic force microscope using other various SPM surface Raman enhancement phenomena\n15)Final Exam","prerequisites":"nothing","texts_and_materials":"No text","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"nanotechnology, diffraction, optical microscope, resolutin, Atomic Force Microscope, Scanning Probe Microscope","office_hours":"By e-mail","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"English","last_update":"3/17/2017 3:41:27 PM","name":{"id":1187,"ja":"精密計測工学特論","en":"Advanced Precision Metrology"},"instructor":{"id":841,"ja":"梅田 倫弘, 安藤 泰久","en":"UMEDA Norihiro, ANDO Yasuhisa"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering(Master)","category":"courses for master's programs","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"","office":"","day_period":"Thu.1","references":""}}
