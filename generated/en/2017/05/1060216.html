Instead of departing from a pathological condition, think about health as a foundation for dynamic life. Through lectures, we are aiming for human beings that can survive also in the coming artificial intelligence society. That is, it is a human figure that constantly creates new things and continues to change while living. By learning the principles of life science (chemistry), you learn the idea method for designing new materials. The theme to be handled includes the following contents.\n・ The global environment that created life\n・ Society that lives in reality\n・ Biomolecules ・ Biopolymers\n・ Material function and interaction\n・ Human effort and learning\n\nIn addition to lectures for basic learning, practical elements such as group discussion, presentation using PowerPoint, experiments and practice as exercises will be included.","expected_learning":"1) Do you know the structure and function of the compounds that make up the unit of life \"cells\", and the material chemistry base of the moving body?\n？ 2) Do you know the concept and design strategy of the living system foundation of cells and individuals that are the foundation of life? Do you know the position of people in the life (cell) lineage?\n3) Do you know the deterioration of life and biomaterials (declining function by time: eg aging and fatigue, diseases, especially lifestyle diseases), cause of exhaustion and prevention guidelines?\n4) Do you know the difference in the design principle of people and non-human creatures and artifacts?\n5) Can you explain the life science base for life sustainability and human sustainability as a member of a sustainable society?","course_schedule":"Introduction 1 Introduction 2 Body-mind Science Lecture I & Practice I Body-mind Science Lecture II & Practice II: Practice of 'Body-mind Science' Body-mind Science exercise I Body-mind Science Lecture III & Practice III Body-mind Science lecture IV: Life chemistry and materials health science I Body-mind ScienceV: Physical function and organs ・ system Body-mind Science Practice IV: Life Chemistry and Materials Health Science I Body-mind Science Practice V Body-mind Science Lecture VI and Practice VI: Evaluation of Body-mind Science Body-mind Science Lecture VII Body-mind Science exercise II Body-mind Science Lecture IX & Practice VII: Life Chemistry / Materials Health Science Summary Body-mind Science ・ Exercise III","prerequisites":"See also: life science, polymer chemistry, education, system theory, social industry and sustainable human science","texts_and_materials":"Material distributed on the day and materials to be posted on Moodle","assessment":"Classroom attendance point 60% (4 points / times for both attendance at the time of calling and submitting report question (also question paper) to be carried out each time during class), 20% presentation (twice), 20% final report evaluate. Attendance to practical training is essential and the brain-body trunk coordinated body learning guided in the third lesson is a key point of this lecture to understand adaptation, so it should be implemented as much as possible daily during the course.\n■ Last report task (Please describe while considering the \"reach criteria\" above)\n(1) About human beings (self): Did you understand health and life systems material chemistry? What does that mean?\n(2) About human being (self): Please write about the human and society that continues to change about the fun and dangers, creativity and imagination of the human system brain science.\n(3) Please write about the points of contact with other classes of the Department of Chemistry of Organic Materials.","message_from_instructor":"Please understand self-creation, changeable life principle, learn respect for individual, new social industry creation, self-innovation way of life.","course_keywords":"Life science, life, cell-to-body & mind dynamics, exercise and nutrition, activity dependence, central dogma, biological properties","office_hours":"Thursday 16: 30-18: 00 ※ If you take an appointment by e-mail, you can make reservations at other dates and times. mshmz@cc.tuat.ac.jp, yatomi@cc.tuat.ac.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"http://celltobody.sandvox.net/","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"10/29/2017 5:26:16 PM","name":{"id":1175,"ja":"有機材料化学講座特別講義Ⅱ","en":"Organic and Polymer Materials Chemistry: Special Lecture Ⅱ"},"instructor":{"id":502,"ja":"跡見 順子, 清水 美穂","en":"ATOMI Yoriko, SHIMIZU Miho"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"工学府博士前期","category":"前期課程科目","department":"","semester":"前学期","course_type":"前学期","facility_affiliation":"工学府","office":"","day_period":"木4","references":"Skeletal muscle and Yoriko Atomi eds.
