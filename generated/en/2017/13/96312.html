Exploitation of renewable biomass energy to substitute it for fossil fuel has been proposed as one of the measures to reduce CO2 emission. This lecture, therefore, introduces research achievements and tactics on clean development mechanism (CDM) plantation, breeding and wood quality of tropical fast-growing trees being planted for CDM, and other effective utilization of wood biomass.\n\n1) Harvesting techniques and energy utilization of forest biomass: Lecture on the harvesting machines and operational system\nof forest biomass as well as economic and energy balances of energy utilization of forest biomass in Japan and Europe.\n2) Clean development mechanism (CDM) plantation: Lecture on the tree growth, breeding strategy, wood quality, and\nutilization of wood from important useful fast-growing trees, such as Acasia, Falcata, and Eucalyputs spp., and CDM\nplantation.\n3) Utilization of wood biomass for energy and chemical materials: There are many methods to utilize wood biomass and H2 gas\nproduction (fuel cell). In addition, biorefinery is now in progress for converting wood biomass to industrial chemicals. The\npresent lecture explains utilization situations, conversion methods, and technologies for wood biomass conversion in the\nworld.","expected_learning":"In order to promote the sustainable forest management, a better understanding about the forest biomass will be acheived.","course_schedule":"This course is composed of the following four themes.\n\n1. Wood properties and forest biomass in tropical forest\n2. Biological and chemical conversions of forest biomass to energy and useful substances\n3. Utilization and forest work of forest biomass\n4. Radioactive contamination of forest and wood","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided in class.","assessment":"Based on report.","message_from_instructor":"Lecture on several aspects of forest biomass will be introduced along with harvesting techniques and energy utilization, clean development mechanism (CDM) plantation, and utilization of wood biomass for energy. We hope it will be somewhat useful for your future investigation.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/10/2017 11:04:05 AM","name":{"id":1669,"ja":"森林バイオマス学特論","en":"Advanced Forest Biomass"},"instructor":{"id":938,"ja":"横田 信三（宇）","en":"YOKOTA Shinsoh"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"United Graduate School Agricultural Science","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Intensive","references":"To be announced in the lectures."}}
