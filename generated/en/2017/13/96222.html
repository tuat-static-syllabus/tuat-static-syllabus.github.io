Topics concerning the food and health have enlivened on the television and the paper every day. It is interesting to know how the food component relates to the prevention and healthy recovery of the sickness.\nHere, the relation between the food and the body will be decoded through the Milk as a filter which is the treasure house of the functional components. The food functioning has done not only as a nutrition source, but relates to various adjustment features such as nervous system, hormone system and immunity system to maintain homeostasis of the body.\nThe aim of this lecture is to raise recognition of importance of the food constituent, including those of the actual form which it originally has, and also those of latent form produced through digestion process from inactive ones, and, simultaneously, to grasp present condition of research concerning the molecular feature in the reactions in the body.","expected_learning":"Understanding of the formation of food and the relationship between food ingredients and body homeostasis.","course_schedule":"1.
