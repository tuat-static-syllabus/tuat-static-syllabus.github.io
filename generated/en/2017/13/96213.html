After the rediscovery of Mendel's work, scientists tried to determine which molecules in the cell were responsible for inheritance. Although genes were known to exist on chromosomes, chromosomes are composed of both protein and DNA―scientists did not know which of these was responsible for inheritance.\n\nAn essentially correct three-dimensional structure of the DNA molecule was proposed in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick. This structure showed that genetic information exists in the sequence of nucleotides on each strand of DNA. Molecular biology has started at this time and exercised an influence on all biological fields, including developmental biology. An animal or plant starts its life as a single cell―a fertilized egg. During development, this cell divides repeatedly to produce many different cells in a final pattern of spectacular complexity and precision. Ultimately, the genome determines the pattern, and the puzzle of developmental biology is to understand how it does so.\n\nNow, all advanced scientific research in biological studies including agriculture, are concerned in basic knowledge of genetics and developmental biology. In this lecture, I will cover the lesson on basic knowledge of genetics and developmental biology, and also introduce advanced research in these fields using model animals.","expected_learning":"Understanding of the basic theories and techniques of genetics and developmental biology.
