Forest vegetation is generally recognized as a key factor influencing landslide occurrences and is linked to forest resource management such as timber production from the socioeconomic aspect. This lecture consists of three main contents as follows: 1) outline of the sediment disasters 2) relation between forest vegetation and landslide, 3) effect of long-term spatiotemporal fluctuation of forest vegetation associated with forest resource management on landslide.","expected_learning":"To understand the impact of long - term forest vegetation change associated with forest resource management on landslides.","course_schedule":"1.
