Through this lecture, you will study basis of dispersion and flocculation which control the transport property of the suspension as well as flow settling property of the turbid water will be explained.","expected_learning":"Students are expected to learn the physiochemical behavior of turbid water in aqueous environment such as in lakes, channels and rivers and to understand sedimentation and flow phenomenon in suspended solid.","course_schedule":"1. Features of clays as colloid\n(1) Classification (2) Motion (3) Sedimentation and diffusion\n2.
