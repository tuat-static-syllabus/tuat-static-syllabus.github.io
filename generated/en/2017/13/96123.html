Understanding the molecular basis for the mechanisms, which govern the organogenesis and tissue-specific functions, will contribute to Animal Breeding Science. This lecture deals with specific genes and proteins that are involved in organogenesis and tissue-specific functions, in relation to tissue architecture of organs.","expected_learning":"Understand basis for proliferation, migration, differentiation and death of cells during organogenesis. Also, understand practical methodology of study on gene expression and cellular function.","course_schedule":"1. Germ layers and organogenesis\n(1) fertilization, （2） formation of 3 germ layers, （3） 3 germ layers and organogenesis\n2. Skeletal myogenesis\n(1) types of myocytes, (2) myogenesis in vivo, (3) myogenesis in vitro, (4) role of myogenesis in animal breeding\n3. Mammogenesis and lactation\n(1) endocrine control of lactation (2) cellular basis for mammogenesis","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided in class.","assessment":"Based on report.","message_from_instructor":"I will give a talk on organogenesis and function of organs that relate to animal production, in aspects of developmental, cellular, and molecular biology.
