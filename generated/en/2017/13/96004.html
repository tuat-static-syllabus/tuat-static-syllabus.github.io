This series of lectures will focus on techniques and skills work to enable students to express themselves more naturally in English.\n","expected_learning":"The lectures will focus on four main areas.\n\n1) Vocabulary Building\nTechniques and approaches to help students to acquire the vocabulary they need to express themselves more fluently in English. Rather than lists and direct translation, students will see vocabulary in context and develop the ability to connect and remember words entirely in English.\n\n2) Presentation Techniques\nA step-by-step approach to researching, organizing and making presentations entirely in English, without resorting to students’ native tongue. Students will also learn to use their voice, gestures and movement to make themselves more easily understood by a variety of audiences.\n\n3) Written Expression\nA series of approaches to enable students to write academic reports in a fluent, natural manner without directly translating existing reports from their native tongue. The lectures will also cover the basic structure and style of English required for reports in a variety of academic fields.\n\n4) Cultural Awareness\nStudents need to be aware of and sensitive to the differing expectations and reactions of people from other cultures. Approaches learned here will help students to be better prepared when communicating in an international environment.\n","course_schedule":"1. Course Introduction/Student Information\n2.
