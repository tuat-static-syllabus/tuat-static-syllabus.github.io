The study area also aiming at planning of forest road and forest road network. It consists of forestry machinery, forestry operation system, ergonomics and forestry civil engineering and uses a variety of study methods.\nIn this class, outlines of the forestry engineering and a life cycle of logs will be given at first. Then, modern researches will be introduced. Furthermore, two popular study methods; vibration analysis and terrain analysis with GIS.","expected_learning":"Understanding outlines of the forestry engineering and a life cycle of logs.\nUnderstanding of the basic knowledge of vibration analysis.\nUnderstanding of the terrain analysis with GIS.","course_schedule":"1.
