Because specific behaviors of animals are limited how their sensory system and its related central nervous developed. In this lecture, character of nervous system and sensory system of several kinds of domestic animal will be introduced.\n1) General guide of sensory system in animals\n(a) What is scene? (b) What kind sense do animals have? (c)Relation of sensory system and central nervous system\n2) Visual system\n(a) Visual organ, (b) Visual system including visual central nervous system, (c) Visual system of avian.\n3) Olfactory system\n(a) Olfactory organ,(b) Olfactory system including central nervous system related olfaction.\n4) Somatosensory system.\n(a)Pain, (b)touch, (c)pressure (d)Segmentations of spinal nerve\n5) How to make a research plan in field of animal physiology and anatomy.","expected_learning":"Understanding of the basic peripheral neural system receipting several senses in skin, special sense such as vision and audition.
