Addition to these harms, weed also causes a wide variety of problems everywhere people are living, such as rivers, railways and parks.\nIn this class, firstly, characteristics of weed harm are reviewed, then, how to evaluate weed harm and how to set up the control plan will be explained. Subsequently, a control method such as chemical (herbicides, plant growth regulators), biological (cover plants, duck etc.), physical (cultivation, film multi etc.), practical (crop rotation, deep flooding water, etc.) and IWM (Integrated Weed Management) will be demonstrated. Finally, outline of herbicide resistant weed which increases in Japan recently and conservation tillage systems widely used in United States and Australia will also be explained from the viewpoint of weed control.","expected_learning":"To understand that weeds are a problem in every scene other than agriculture, and to learn various control methods of weeds.","course_schedule":"1.
