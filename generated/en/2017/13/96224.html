Especially, NMR spectroscopy is the most useful technique to determine the structure of compounds because the NMR spectra offer a great deal of information. This lecture will give students with an overview on NMR spectroscopy, essential kinds of NMR spectra, and the typical structure determination method.","expected_learning":"Understandings of the overview and usability of NMR spectroscopy and structure determination method to analyze NMR spectra.","course_schedule":"1.
