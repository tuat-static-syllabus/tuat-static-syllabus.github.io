In addition, Healthy forest provides various resources (e.g. timber), supporting human life. These forest functions (ecological services) would be degraded by tropospheric ozone (an air pollutant), which has increased since the industrial revolution. This lecture will discuss ozone effects on forest tree species. First topic will be past and current status of ozone pollution in Japan as back ground. Then, ecophysiological responses of trees to ozone will be described. After that, we will discuss risk assessment of ozone impact on Japanese representative tree species. Finally, recent advanced research will be introduced.","expected_learning":"A better understanding of the ecophysiological response of trees to ozone and the risk of ozone impact as an air pollutant decreasing forest health.","course_schedule":"1.
