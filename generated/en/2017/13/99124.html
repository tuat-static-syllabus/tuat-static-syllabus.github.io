I will explain my original specific bioassays for allelopathy, namely: “Plant Box Method”; “Sandwich Method”; “Dish-pack Method”; and “Rhizosphere soil Method”. Using these methods, I have evaluated about 4,000 plants from Japan, Asia and Pacific countries. My main targets are 1) to isolate innovative bioactive natural chemicals from allelochemicals, and 2) to use allelopathic ground cover plants in agriculture and environment. In this line, I would like to propose a new concept of an ideal ground cover plant with allelopathic activity that could also be a natural resource for food, medicinal use, or landscape (i.e. with beautiful flowers, leaves or fragrant perfume). Useful annual cover plants and their respective allelochemicals will be explained.","expected_learning":"Understanding of novel method for the isolation and identification of allelochemicals, and practical utilization of these plants for sustainable agriculture.","course_schedule":"Lecture 1: On useful annual cover plants and their respective allelochemicals. 1-1) Velvetbean (Mucuna pruriens), L-DOPA; 1-2) Hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), cyanamide; 1-3) buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), rutin.\nLecture 2: Potential perennial cover plants. 2-1) Centipedegrass (Eremochloa ophiuroides), tryptophan and others; 2-2) wild oats (Avena strigosa), allelochemicals are unknown; 2-3) dwarf mondo grass (Ophiopogon japonicus), salicylic acid; 2-4) hyacinth orchid (Bletilla striata), militarine; 2-5) red spider lily (Lycoris radiata), lycorine; and 2-6) Thunberg spiraea (Spiraea thunbergii), cis-cinnamic acid.
