Especially, genetic manipulation of the genus Sphingomonas is necessary to improve the ability of these bacteria to degrade xenobiotic compounds and to elucidate the unique mechanisms involved in degradation. Strains of the genus Sphingomonas have a unique characteristic: they contain glycosphingolipids, which are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cell membranes. When Sphingomonas sp. strain A1 assimilates a macromolecule (alginate), a mouth-like pit is formed on the cell surface through reorganization and/or fluidity of the pleats, causing extracellular alginate to be concentrated in the pit. However, a plasmid suitable for genetic manipulation of Sphingomonas has not been identified. Some vector systems in sphingomonads with a broad-host-range plasmid or a cryptic plasmid have been reported. Also, transformation of sphingomonads by conjugation has been described.\nHere, we show the Plasmids Biology as follows.\n\n1) Characterization of plasmid replication systems.\n2) Characterization of plasmid partition systems and replication systems.\n3)Construction of expression vector for various useful bacteria as hosts.","expected_learning":"Understanding of the basic theories of replication and partition mechanisms.
