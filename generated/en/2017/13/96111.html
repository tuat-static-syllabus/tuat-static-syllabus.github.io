Previously, major plant classifications at higher level have been suggested based on morphological data. However, recently molecular phylogenetic studies have been comprehensively conducted in plants, and suggested new classification partly differing from the previous classification based on morphological data. In this lecture, classifications based on morphological and molecular data, and similarities and differences between the two classification types will be introduced.\nAdaptation is defined as a phenomenon of certain organism to obtain advantageous trait for fitting certain biological and non-biological environment, and is thought to be one of the most powerful factors bringing species evolution. In this lecture, adaptation with morphological evolution will be introduced referring some examples including rheophyte caused in stream. Furthermore, biomimetics created based on plant morphology will be introduced.","expected_learning":"Understanding plant classifications based on morphological data and molecular phylogeny based on DNA data; and similarities and differences between the two classification types.
