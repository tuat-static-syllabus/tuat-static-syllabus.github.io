Their biogeochemical cycling makes up the earth’s environment. On the other hand, the alterations of these cycling have resulted in a variety of important environmental issues. Such relationships between biogeochemical cycling and environmental issues will be discussed in this lecture. In addition, the history how the biogeochemical cyclings have been developed in the planet Earth will be explained.\n\nThis lecture will have a seminar style in addition to lecture style. Some small test will be made. We are going to have a discussion based on this small test.","expected_learning":"To understand how the Earth’s environment that only allows living things to live has been developed and is maintained.\nTo understand that ocean and terrestrial environments have the structures that strongly affect biogeochemical cyclings and the existence of life.\nTo understand the scientific basis and acquire the ability to conceive the essence of this issue through the own thought.","course_schedule":"（1）The history of the earth’s environment and the evolution of biogeochemical cycling.\n（2）The condensation of elements on the earth (especially carbon)\n（3）The structure of marine environment and biogeochemical cycling\n（4）The structure of terrestrial environment and biogeochemical cycling\n（5）The issue of climate change solved from biogeochemical aspect.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Based on report.","message_from_instructor":"It is President Trump that should learn most the biogeochemistry on climate change.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/10/2017 10:56:55 AM","name":{"id":1674,"ja":"環境生態系保全学特論","en":"Advanced Ecosystem Conservation"},"instructor":{"id":232,"ja":"楊 宗興","en":"YO Muneoki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"United Graduate School of Agricultural Science(Doctor)","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Biogeochemistry, 3rd ed., Schlesinger and Bernhardt, Elsevier, 2013"}}
