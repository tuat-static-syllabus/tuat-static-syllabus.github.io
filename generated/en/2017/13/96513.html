For that, technical support is indispensable. I will talk about planning support method using visualization technology on reconstruction plan.\nAlso, to complete the plan, how to build consensus after discussion is the key. Especially when deciding the height of dikes, there are many cases where opinion is divided. We discuss the way of voting by stakeholders to solve it.\nFurthermore, I will clarify issues related to the restoration and reconstruction of farmland and agricultural facilities in the land subsidence area, and the problem for farmland integration which is expected to accelerate in the disaster areas.","expected_learning":"Recognize the importance of residents' participatory learning reconstruction-planning in disaster areas, and understand how to use visualization technology to support it.","course_schedule":"1.
