The amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to be used tends to be higher than other crops and outdoor vegetables, and there is concern about the burden on the surrounding environment.\nIn this lecture, first, the problems of protected production on environmental burden and the reason why such problems became obvious will be described based on the characteristics of protected production. Next, the way of thinking and technique about reduction of chemical fertilizer and pesticide and the case study on the lecturer concerned will be described.\nFinally, organic fertilizers are often paid attention to promote environmental conservation agriculture, however, these are not equal. There are also many unexplained parts about the effect of organic fertilizer. The role of organic fertilizer when it is applied to greenhouse will be described.","expected_learning":"To comprehend the circumstances leading to promotion of environmental conservation type agriculture and the direction of future crop production by comparing the features and problems of conventional agriculture and environmental preservation agriculture.","course_schedule":"1: What is agriculture of environmental conservation type\n2: Problems of over application of chemical fertilizer and the meaning of its reduction\n3: Problems of agricultural chemicals and the meaning of its reduction\n4: Use of organic fertilizer","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided in class.","assessment":"Based on report.","message_from_instructor":"I will start my lectures from basic topics for students who are not familiar with this field.
