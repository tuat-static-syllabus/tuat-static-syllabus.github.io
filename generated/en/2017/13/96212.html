The approaches described in this lecture can be applicable to the dynamic analyses of many other cellular processes, and thus, will provide an advanced guide for students who want to learn about proteomics. This lecture is presented to point the way to dynamic analyses of cellular functions in proteomic scale using LS-MS technology not only for geneticist and molecular biologists moving from the studies of genomics and genotype to those of proteomics and phenotype, but also cell biologists, developmental biologists, neuroscientists etc., who are reluctant to get into proteomics because of interest gap between their individual and proteomics researches.","expected_learning":"Understanding of the basic theories and techniques of proteomics. Understanding how the proteomics is related to the other field of genomics.","course_schedule":"This lecture will begin with overview of proteomics that provides the concept of proteomics, reviews the historical aspects of proteomic analysis and the state-of-art of proteomic technologies, together with a number of successful biological applications using the proteomic technology. In the second chapter of this lecture, I describe the basic aspects of LC-MS technology including the principle of the method and assembly of the LC-MS system, and explain the integrated LC-based MS methodologies coupled with bioinformatics to search for the genome-database for large-scale and high-throughput protein analyses.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"None","assessment":"Based on report.","message_from_instructor":"I hope that a way of thinking and technology in proteomics help your future studies.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/17/2017 3:46:03 PM","name":{"id":1659,"ja":"先端生命科学特論","en":"Advanced Life Science"},"instructor":{"id":168,"ja":"高橋 信弘","en":"TAKAHASHI Nobuhiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"連合農学研究科","category":"","department":"","semester":"前学期","course_type":"前学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"","day_period":"集中","references":"Manuals for proteome analysis, eds.
