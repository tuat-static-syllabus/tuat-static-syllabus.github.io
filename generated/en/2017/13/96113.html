This suggestion includes resolutions of food problem and environment issue, expansions of associated industries, and the creation of employment by taking full advantage of various functions of plants. In this lecture, role of plant genetics and breeding science in green innovation is discussed.\n1) Objects of plant genetics and breeding science: history of researches of plant genetics and breeding science for accomplishment of traditional objects such as expansion of food production and quality improvement is outlined. In addition, new objects of plant genetics and breeding science for green innovation such as reduction of greenhouse gases and development of renewable energy sources are suggested.\n2) Process of accomplishing objects of plant genetics and breeding science: the overall picture for process of accomplishing objects of plant genetics and breeding science is clarified, and then progresses and problems in researches for accomplishment of each object in the field of plant genetics and breeding science are outlined.\n3) Technique of analysis for accomplishing objects of plant genetics and breeding science: Genomic editing by artificial nucleases or CRISPR/Cas9 system will be introduced as a breeding technology that contributes to accomplish the objects of plant genetics and breeding science.\n","expected_learning":"Understanding of the conventional objectives and new objectives of plant genetics and breeding science and the process to achieve those objectives.
