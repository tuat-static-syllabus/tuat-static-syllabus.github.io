Recently, many advanced countries including Japan have a problem about an aging society, thus the medical cost is growing. The brain disorders became a serious problem in an aging society, because the medication for brain disorders limited. Therefore, it is important to prevent the development of the brain disorders in our life. Moreover, the social stress increases the depression and other brain disorders. Recently, the nutrition became important factors for preventing these brain disorders. For example, the arachidonic acid facilitates the neurogenesis in hippocampus and supports the learning and memory function.","expected_learning":"Understanding of basic brain functions and the research topics related to brain science.","course_schedule":"This lecture includes the following topics;\n1) Brain structure and its function\n2) Mechanisms of learning and memory\n3) Effect of stress on the brain function and behavior\n4) Effect of nutrition on the brain function (learning, memory and stress)\n5) Hot topics about the brain and nutrition (epigeneitics)","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided in class","assessment":"Based on report.","message_from_instructor":"The research field of the brain function and nutrition is growing, and the pharmacy, food and chemical industrial companies interest the field.
