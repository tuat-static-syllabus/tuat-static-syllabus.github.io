Modern agriculture has various problems to be solved such as changes in economic environment and policy, environment issues, poverty of farmers in developing countries and etc. The aims of agricultural economics are to extract fundamental factors of a problem in agriculture and to propose and evaluate policies to solve the problem. Statistical analysis can be an effective analytical tool, because it affords us to present objective evidence obtained from data.\n\nOutline of this course is as follows. First, fundamental theory of statistics and descriptive statistics will be introduced. Second, students will learn linear regression models and the ordinary least squares (OLS) as a favorable estimation technique. Third, students will learn various statistical tests which can be used for testing your hypothesis based on the estimated model and how to treat with violation of some assumptions necessary for the OLS to be a good estimator. Finally, some application examples of regression models in agricultural economics will be introduced. Students will discuss the results and learn how to start doing independent research using economic data.\n\n","expected_learning":"Students are expected to learn fundamental theory and methods of statistics and regression models and have greater confidence in its application on real problems in agriculture.\n","course_schedule":"1.
