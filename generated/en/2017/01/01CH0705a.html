Because the reactivity and other chemical properties are determined by their structure and electronic configuration. In this course, we try to understand the following points;\n1. Relation between electronic configuration and the elemental properties\n2. Relation between chemical bonds and the elemental properties\n3. Properties and reaction of materials in solid and liquid states\n","expected_learning":"It is required to understand the periodic electronic configuration of atoms and chemical and physical properties of materials based on the elemental structure.","course_schedule":"1.
