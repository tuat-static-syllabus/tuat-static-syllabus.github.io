Therefore, items to be dealt with in this lecture are not confined to the area of chemistry. Meteorology and atmospheric physics are tightly related to atmospheric chemistry and they are sometimes regarded as a field of atmospheric chemistry. However, because of the limitation of time, the target of this lecture for students is to become able to analyze many kinds of phenomena taking place in the atmosphere from a point of view of chemistry. For this purpose gas-phase chemical reactions will be lectured in the former half and field measurements of atmospheric phenomena will be lectured in the latter half. Knowledge of meteorology and atmospheric physics will be utilized in case of need.","expected_learning":"To understand the structure and composition of the atmosphere as well as atmospheric pollutants and atmospheric chemical reactions.\nTo understand the global environmental problems related to the atmosphere and the relation between local air pollution and regional air pollution as well as their impacts and measures on the bases of fundamental knowledge on structure and composition of the atmosphere, major air pollutants and their environmental standards, as well as atmospheric chemical reactions involved in photochemical smog.","course_schedule":"\"1.
