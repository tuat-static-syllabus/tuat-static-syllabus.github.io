Biodiversity is the origine of many crops and usefulplants for agriculture. How and why species adapted to the environment and made diverse existence will be discussed. Invasive alien species are acute problems in agriculture and environment. The curent status of risk assessment and how to manage will be discused. But introduction of new crop species are important and one of the characteritics of agriculture. How to intorduce new plants after the assessment of risk is important. Allelopathy and chemical ecology, one of the basis of plant ecology, and application of plant ecology, such as weed ecology, seed ecology, and weed in urban city will also discussed.","expected_learning":"【Target】\n1)Biological Interaction, Co-evolution\n2)Biodiversity\n3)Vegetation Survey focused on Crop-Weed community\n4)Introduction of Useful Ago-biological Resources\n5)Problem with Invasive Alien Plants, its dark side and future.\n6)GMO(Genetically Modified Plants and their influence to Agro-Ecosystems.\n6)Chemical Ecology and Allelopathy\n7)Weed Ecology and Biology","course_schedule":"1) Introduction\n2) History, concept, methodology\n3) Shape and life form of plants (rosett, creeping, vein, halophyte etc)\n4) Plant comunity, analisis of plant comunity, statistics for plant ecology\n5) Succession, primary and secondary\n6) Habitat, phytoclimatology\n7) Vegetation zone in Japan and world, Phytogeography\n8) Biodiversity and its crisis, utilization\n9) Interaction between plants, plants and other factors\n10) Chemical ecology and allelopathy\n11) Ecological evolution, adaptation and evolution\n12) Weed biology, agriculture and weed\n13) Invasive alien plants, risk asessment, management\n14) Plant ecology and agriculture\n15) Plant ecology in urban city, summary, submissiojn of final report","prerequisites":"None","texts_and_materials":"None, but it is recommended to read Reference publications below.
