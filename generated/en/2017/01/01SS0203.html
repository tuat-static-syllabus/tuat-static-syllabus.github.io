Multicultural symbiosis is a contemporary issue that aims to “live together in the region” with people of different nationalities and ethnic groups. Perhaps, this can also be said as a problem of “human being” concerning “relationship with others”.\nIn this course, we mainly focus on the “relationship with others” in the Western ancient literary works (= Western Classics), which are products of the culture far from modern Japan. Through the “classics” which remains for more than 2000 years, we will think about the problems of “human being” beyond the time and regions.\n","expected_learning":"1.

The problem dealt with in this course is, so to speak, a problem without “correct answer”.
