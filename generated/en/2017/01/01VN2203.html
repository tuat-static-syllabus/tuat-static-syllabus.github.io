Estimation is performed addition of point of attendance (60%), report (30%) and attitude of tackling to practice (10%).","message_from_instructor":"Never forget this practice is the training for handling of pathogenic microbes that cause infectious diseases in some cases. Eating and drinking at the practical room during the practice is strictly forbidden. Anyone who left a white robe and scuffs cannot receive the practice. When there are students who misbehave oneself and take a dangerous behavior during this practice, these students have to get out from this practice room.","course_keywords":"terile technique・Sterilization and disinfection・Bacteria culture, staining and identification・cell culture and methods for handling viruses・serological test・detection of antigens and antibodies","office_hours":"Consultation and a question accept an e-mail at any time.
