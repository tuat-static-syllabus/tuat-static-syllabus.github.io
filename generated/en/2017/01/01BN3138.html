Differing from the conventional protein chemistry that covers the individual proteins, the Tanpakugaku is a discipline that targets and characterizes proteome (the entire complement of proteins that is or can be expressed by a cell, tissue, or organism) on the basis of genomic information. In English, the Tanpakugaku is called Proteomics providing a methodology and concept to understand proteins in a single biological system. Proteomics is one of the most important disciplines in post-genome science and is essential for life science including health pharmaceuticals, agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry and for the development of the industries of the 21st century including those of the environmental and information fields. This lecture covers basic concept and knowledge of proteomics that is constructed through the path to the transcriptome from the genome, under comparison with the conventional life science or other biological science. The aim of this lecture is to learn the basic methodology and technology used in proteomics and understand theory of proteomics in biological phenomena.","expected_learning":"To understand the post-genome science by the road to transcriptome-proteome from the genome.\nTo capture the protein as a group, and understand the basics of the technologies that are used to analyze the function of proteome, and the concepts of proteomics.\nTo understand proteomics in relation to the other areas of the Genome science. To cultivate basic knowledge and perspective of proteomics through the example of application to the fields, including medical care, food and nutrition.","course_schedule":"I will lecture on the following course content.\n\n1.　Outline of proteomics（History of proteomics, Relationship to the other genome science）\n2.　Basics of genome science 1 (Outline of genomics)\n3.　Basics of genome science 2 (structure and function of chromosome)\n4.　Basics of genome science 3 (about epigenetic code)\n5.　Gene expression (role of transcription factors)\n6.　Transcriptome (concept and experimental procedures)\n7.　Transcriptional regulation of transcriptome (constitutive and regulatory control of gene expression)\n8.　Post-transcriptional regulation (Expansion of diversity of transcriptome)\n9.　Regulation of transcriptome, and basics of proteomics\n10. Methodology of proteomics (peptide mass fingerprinting, shotgun analysis)\n11. Quantitative proteomics (in vitro- and in vivo-labeling methods)\n12.　Translational and post-translational regulation of proteome\n13.　Post-translational processing of proteome\n14.　Function of proteome\n15.　Examination or preparing report","prerequisites":"It is preferable for the students to have completed Biochemistry I, II, III, and Molecular biology.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Evaluation will be done based on the results of the examination (or report)(60%), and the percentage of attendance (40%). To prove the attendance, the students are asked to answer short questions at the beginning of each lesson and have to submit the answer sheet.","message_from_instructor":"I am going to talk about the proteomics by linking proteome to the familiar phenomena. I expect to have frank questions and comments from the students.","course_keywords":"Genome science, Baisics of proteomics, Separation and identification of proteins, Protein-protein interaction network, Health and diseases","office_hours":"Freely, please contact ntakahas@cc.tuat.ac.jp.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/16/2017 10:57:03 AM","name":{"id":190,"ja":"蛋白学","en":"Proteomics"},"instructor":{"id":168,"ja":"高橋 信弘","en":"TAKAHASHI Nobuhiro"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":14,"min":3},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Wed.3","references":"\"Know the full picture of the proteome\" Yodosha, \"Proteome analysis laboratory manuals\" Yodosha, proteome analysis, \"Genome\" Medical Science International, and Lehninger \"new biochemistry\", ."}}
