And also the advantage of this university that there are many professors who are doing studies related to environmental problems is utilized to the maximum.\nThe lecture is opened in the Faculty of Agriculture for the first semester on the analyses of present environmental problems and their impacts on ecosystems; training and symposium are given to this lecture. The lecture is opened in the Faculty of Engineering for the second semester by learning the basics of environmental measures, experiencing technologies of environmental measures, and getting more knowledge by attending a symposium. Thus, students learn present status of environment and technologies of environmental measures in one year. Attending the lecture of either the first or second semester is allowed.\n","expected_learning":"First semester: Environmental Sciece and Technology I\nLectures and trainings are made concernig environmental problems related to atmospher, hydrosphere, and pedosphere, and their impacts on microorganisms, insects, wild animals, and plants.
