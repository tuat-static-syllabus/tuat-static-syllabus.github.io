The objective of this course is to learn fundamental concepts of forest soils and their relationships to forest communities and forest ecosystems. And then this is to develop an understanding of the biogeochemical and physical properties of forest soils in relation to forest environment and forest management practices.\nStudents will learn forest soil forming process and classification, physicochemical and biological properties of soil, and their research methods. And then you will learn organic matter decomposition, stream water quality, and nutrients uptake of trees.","expected_learning":"Students need to gain knowledge of forest soil properties and research methods. And you need to gain ability to assess forest soil and site quality.","course_schedule":"　Introduction: forest environment and soil\n　Forest soil formation 1: influence of environments on soil forming\n　Forest soil formation 2: topography and forest soil\n　Forest soil formation 3: climatic index and zonal soil\n　Soil classification 1: soil groups and soil type of Japan\n　Soil classification 2: soil profile and research methods\n　Forest soil physiology: three phases of soil, soil particle, soil water etc.\n　Forest soil chemistry: soil acidity, soil colloid, cation exchange etc.\n　Report discussion: characteristics of forest soil in Japan\n　Soil organism: soil fauna, soil microbe, mycorrhiza, root nodule etc.\n　Nutrients uptake: relationships to forest communities and soil\n　Organic matter decomposition: relationships to nutrients dynamics in forest soil\n　Stream water quality: biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling\n　Silvicultural impact on forest soil: regeneration and revegetation\n　Final examination\n\nThe quizzes will be given in each class.
