Knowledge on this organ pathology plays an introductory role for clinical veterinary medicine. This knowledge also provides basics for toxicopatholological analysis of chemicals using experimental animals.","expected_learning":"In the course of Animal Special Pathology B, pathological lesions that appear in following organs in animals are dealt in terms of the understanding of pathogenesis as well as the comparative pathological viewpoint.\n1. Urinary system: kidney, ureter, urinary bladder, urethral duct.\n2. Reproductive system: testis, epididymis, male accessory sex organs, ovary, oviduct, uterus, placenta, external genital organs, mammary gland.\n3. Endocrine system: pituitary gland, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal gland.\n4. Nervous system: brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve.\n5. Sensory organs: eye, ear.\n6. Integument: skin.\n","course_schedule":"In the class of Veterinary Special Pathology B, lecture is conducted on pathological conditions and pathogenesis of representative lesions that appear in following organs, following the class of Veterinary Special Pathology A at the 2nd semester of the 3rd grade.\n\n1.

Powerpoint documents will also be handed out.","assessment":"Regular achievement tests: 100%. There are no attendance points.","message_from_instructor":"Pathology is one of the academic disciplines required for the National Veterinary Medical Practitioners Qualifying Examination. Animal Pathology is positioned between basic veterinary classes and clinical classes, and thus, it is necessary to have knowledge on anatomy, histology, immunology, and microbiology to have appropriate understanding of lesions. It will be difficult to have appropriate understandings on clinical classes, such as veterinary surgery and veterinary internal medicine.","course_keywords":"Pathological lesions in major organs, Degenerative changes, Adaptive cellular changes and abnormalities in cellular differentiation, Circulatory disturbances, Inflammation, Immunopathology, Oncology, Malformation.","office_hours":"Office hour：8:30〜18:30.
