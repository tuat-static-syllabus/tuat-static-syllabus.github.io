You will understand what factors regulate whether the chemical reaction takes place or not. The purpose of this course is to understand basic items of thermodynamics with examples of familiar phenomena. Beginning with conversion of units and gas state equation, you will understand the concepts in internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy and study spontaneity of chemical changes, based on the knowledge that you have obtained in chemistry courses in high school. This course “Physical Chemistry A” is a basis to learn other courses in specialized subjects.","expected_learning":"To achieve the level where you can understand the 1st, 2nd and 3rd law of thermodynamics.\nTo achieve the level where you understand the concept of free energy and can judge whether a particular process is spontaneous or not.\nTo achieve the level where you can understand chemical phenomena and biological phenomena from the view point of physical chemistry.\n","course_schedule":"1st　Oct. 2nd Chapter 1 The property of gas 　1・5 Gas constant\nInternational system of units ( S I units )\nOct.9th national holiday no class\n2nd Oct.16th 1・3 Ideal gas　Boyle’s law Charles’ law Avogadro’s principle\nCombined gas law　Perfect gas equation of state 1・6 kinetic theory of gas　\n3rd Oct.23rd　 1・9 real gas ~　1・12 van der Waals equation\n4th Oct.30th　 Chapter 2．The first law of thermodynamics ( P.29 ~ )\n　 Definition of work　work with volume change　the first law of thermodynamics in closed system\n5th Nov.6th 　2・6 enthalpy　2・7 heat capacity relationship between ＣＰ and ＣＶ\n11 / 13　no class\n6th Nov. 20th　 2・8 ~ 2・9 thermochemistry\n7th Nov. 27th　（dead line of report）Chapter 3 The second law of thermodynamics ( P.57~ )\n3・2 heat engine 3・3 Carnot cycle　\n8th Dec.4th 3・4 entropy and the second law of thermodynamics\n9th Dec. 11th 3・5 entropy changes for various processes\n　　　　　　　　 3・6 entropy and disorder\n10th Dec.18th　 3・7 the third law of thermodynamics　3・8 absolute entropy\n　　　　　　　　 3・9 entropy changes for chemical reactions　　3・10 a special topic\n1/ 8　national holiday no class\n11th Jan. 15th Chapter 4．Free energy and chemical equilibrium ( P.82 ~）\n　　　　　　　 4・2 free energy 　4・3 standard free energy change\n4・4 free energy and spontaneous change　4・5 effect of changes in pressure and temperature\n12th Jan.22th 4・8 phase equilibrium in pure substance　Clausius ?
