In this course, we will first introduce basic concepts and terms of statistics such as means, variances, probability distributions, etc. Then, observing the connection between statistical properties of samples and those of the population, we will learn methods of interval estimation and hypothesis testing.","expected_learning":"The goal of this course is to be capable of\n(1) understanding standard terms and notations of mathematical statistics,\n(2) calculating the mean and standard deviation of a given set of numbers,\n(3) applying normal distribution or Student's t-distribution to estimation of the mean of the population,\n(4) testing a statistical hypothesis by using normal distribution.\n","course_schedule":"1. Means and variances, standard deviations (pp.6-7, pp.10-14, pp.18-21)\n2. Random variables, distribution functions (pp.34-40)\n3. Covariances and correlation coefficients (pp.22-27, p.48)\n4. Means and variances of the sum of random variables (pp.42-52)\n5. Binomial distribution and Normal distribution\n6. Applications of normal distribution, Poisson distribution (pp.59-63)7. Exercises I\n7. Exercises I\n8. Sampling distributions, the central limit theorem (pp.74-81)\n9. Interval estimations based on normal distribution (pp.82-90)\n10. Hypothesis tests I (pp.92-100)\n11.
