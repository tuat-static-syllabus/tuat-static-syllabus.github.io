You will discuss specific themes that your teacher provides. You aim to grow out of passive accumulation-type learning methods that you might have been taught so far. Moreover, you try to have a critical mind by yourself, learn methods to study independently, and develop your abilities to read and understand, write, express yourself and communicate with others.\nYou can interact with a teacher of a different course in the Department of Agriculture. In this process, you are expected to become aware of yourself as a university student, form your character and learn basic manners required for working successfully in a society.","expected_learning":"You are expected to master how to enhance your abilities\n(1) to set your theme by yourself;\n(2) to find and summarize materials;\n(3) to tell others correctly what you think; and\n(4) to enhance your ability to discuss","course_schedule":"Main subject: what is biotechnology?\n\nSeminar contents: Progress of molecular biology or biochemistry has developed biotechnology drastically.

In this class, you will make some small groups, decide a biotechnology that you are interested in, investigate the research background of the technology, and its advantage or disadvantage to our society, and present by PowerPoint. After the presentation, we all will discuss.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"5/16/2017 4:53:42 PM","name":{"id":298,"ja":"農学基礎ゼミ","en":"Basic Seminar of Agricultural Science"},"instructor":{"id":287,"ja":"佐々木 信光","en":"SASAKI Nobumitsu"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学部","category":"全学共通教育科目","department":"生物生産学科, 環境資源科学科, 地域生態システム学科, 共同獣医学科","semester":"前学期","course_type":"前学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"","day_period":"木1","references":""}}
