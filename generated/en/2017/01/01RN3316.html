Material and nutrients dynamics in forest soil systems are understood through physicochemical and biological analysis of them. The objective of this course is not only to train the field research and laboratory experimental methods of forest soil, but also to learn basic knowledge of writing way for scientific reports.\nFirst, students will train the research methods of soil fauna and soil profile, and collect some soils for physicochemical analysis in the field. And then you will train the laboratory experiment of forest soil. Finally, we will discuss the forest soils from the whole data.","expected_learning":"Students need to gain ability to research method of forest soil profile and fauna, and to analyze into physicochemical properties of forest soil. And also you need to gain methods of writing of scientific report.","course_schedule":"Field practice\nAttention! The field trip information will be shown the web notice in the first semester. Students need to attend the guidance for the field trip at room 1-420, 12:30-13:00, 17 April 2017.\nResearch of soil profile and fauna, Soil collection for laboratory analysis\nThese reports will be assigned to each group.\n\nLaboratory analysis\nGeneral caution of laboratory analysis: consideration of safety and environment\nExplain about the analysis: reading of text, items, precision and a significant figure\nPreparation of the soil: soil sampling for chemical analysis, replication\nPhysical analysis: three phases of soil, bulk density, maximum water holding capacity\nChemical analysis: acidity, total carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous, available phosphorous, exchangeable cation and cation exchangeable capacity\nThese reports will be assigned to each group.\n\nDiscussion from the whole data.\nThis is a final report. This report will be assigned to each person.\n\nNote: Laboratory analysis menu might be changed because of laboratory condition.","prerequisites":"It is recommended that students have learned basic experiment on chemical analysis and completed the Practice on Silviculture.
