The special feature of the NIR is to be able to quantify and qualify the samples based on the chemical information as well as infrared spectroscopy. Moreover, NIR does not require pretreatment of samples, and the transmission properties of NIR light is higher for biological objects than that of IR light. However, it is required to use multivariate regression methods for analyzing NIR spectra, because the spectral peak separation is the difficulty to determine the assignments of the peaks. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is frequently used to analyze the spectra. The purposes of this lecture are:\n1. To understand the principle of NIR spectroscopy,\n2. To understand the principle of PLSR,\n3. To understand the application of NIR spectroscopy and PLSR.\n","expected_learning":"This lecture requires to think and promote better understanding about:\n1.
