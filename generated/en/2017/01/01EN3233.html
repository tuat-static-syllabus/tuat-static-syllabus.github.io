Radioctive substances that were released by the accident were transferred and deposited according to meteorological process. Since the deposition those radioactive substances have been migrating in the environment according to the properties of elements of the radionuclides. This lecture aims at giving knowledge of how radocesium (Cs-134 and Cs-137)that has relatively long halflife among the radinuclides released by the accident behave in the environment according to the hydrological and ecological processes. Based on this students will also learn about the means of radiation protectio including evacuation, decontamination, food monitoring etc.","expected_learning":"Students who attended this class shall\n(1) understand the behaviors of radiocesium in the environment including river-lake, agricultural field and forest systems and will be able to forcast them qualitatively.\n(2) understand behaviors of radionuclides in the environment other than radiocesium.\n(3) understand the radiation and radiation protection from natural and artificial origin.","course_schedule":"1. The accident of Fukushima Daiich Nuclear Power Plant\n2. Radioactives, radiation and radiation protection\n3. Influence on agriculture, fishery and forestry\n4. Radiocesium in the forest system\n5. Radiocesium in river -lake system\n6. Influences on biota\n7. Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident","prerequisites":"The class is related to the movement or cycling of elements according to hydrology and ecology.","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Test during the class","message_from_instructor":"It was shown that nuclear power accident gave a strong influence on agriculture, fishery and forestry, unfortunately. We must learn lessons from the experiences after the accident involving monitoring scheme, decontamination etc. We also have opportunities to investigate the environmental radioactivity from various viewpoints.","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/27/2017 4:30:04 PM","name":{"id":278,"ja":"環境資源科学特別講義Ⅵ","en":"Special Lecture on Environmental Sciences and Natural Resources VI"},"instructor":{"id":262,"ja":"難波 謙二","en":""},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":14,"min":3},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":"Tasaki (2012) Basic knowledge for the people who come to live with annoying radiation.
