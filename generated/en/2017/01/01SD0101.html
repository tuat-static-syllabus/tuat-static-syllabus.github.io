Resolving these issues and constructing a sustainable society requires efforts from a broad range of perspectives extending beyond the pivotal agriculture and engineering framework. Now more than ever, we believe that the role we play as researchers in realizing an environmentally-sustainable society is important, and it is our duty as a leading research-oriented academic institution to vigorously engage in our philosophy of \"Mission-Oriented Research and Education giving Synergy in Endeavors toward a Sustainable Earth (“MORE SENSE”) for our endeavors in what we call “green innovation” and “life innovation,” or the innovation of environmental and life sciences. Innovation, which at its core can be defined as “a creation of new fundamental values,” cannot be achieved unless an assertive approach based on meaningful cooperation between educational institutions, business, and the public sector is taken.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"4/13(Thr)\n10 : 30〜　General guidance of \" Introduction to MORE SENSE\"　\n10 : 40〜　President Dr. Ohno（35min）\n11 : 15〜　 Dean Dr. Chiba（35min）\n11 : 50〜　 writing impressions essay（15min）\n\n4/20(The)\n10 : 30〜 “Career education” Dr. Moriyama（35min）\n11：05〜　“Global education” Dr. Iwata（15min）\n11：20〜　Department of Biological Production: Dr. Ohkawa（25min）\n11：55〜　writing impressions essay（10min）\n\n4/27(The)\n10：30〜　“Safety education” Dr. Miura (30min）\n11：00〜　Department of Applied Biological Science: Dr. Miura（25min）\n11：25〜　Department of Ecoregion Science: Dr. Kaji（25min）\n11：50〜　writing impressions essay（10min）\n\n5/11(Thr)\n10 : 30〜 Department of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences: Dr. Shikata（25min）\n10 : 55〜 Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine: Dr. Shibutani (25min)\n11：25〜　Guidance for studying abroad: Dr. Kato（15min）\n11：35〜　Guidance for the final report of \" Introduction to MORE SENSE\"（10min）\n11：45〜 writing impressions essay（15min）\n\n5/18(Thr)\n10：30〜　“Research ethics” Dr. Shirabe from TIT（70min）\n11：50〜　writing impressions essay（15min）","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"Final report and attend (short reports)","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"TUAT, MORE SENSE","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/3/2017 8:11:38 PM","name":{"id":414,"ja":"MORE SENSE 入門","en":"Introduction to MORE SENSE"},"instructor":{"id":278,"ja":"渡辺 元","en":"WATANABE Gen"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学部","category":"全学共通教育科目","department":"","semester":"前学期","course_type":"前学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"","day_period":"木2","references":""}}
