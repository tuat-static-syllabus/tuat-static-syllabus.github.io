Therefore, it is a required subject for students learning applied plant science. In this lecture, \"growth and differentiation\" and \"energy and metabolism\" in plant cells are reviewed mainly and the basic knowledge in this field are explained.","expected_learning":"The standard of this lecture is to understand a basic physiology of the plant hormone and a photosynthetic process.","course_schedule":"The following is main contents of this lecture.\n\n1. (1) What is the plant physiology?\n(2) Agriculture and plant physiology\n\n2. Growth and differentiation\n(1) Growth and the differentiation\n(2) Plant hormones and their physiological function\n(3) Physiological function of auxin\n(4) Physiological function of gibberellin\n(5) Physiological function of cytokinin\n(6) Physiological function of ethylene\n(7) Physiological function of abscisic acid\n(8) Physiological function of brassinosteroid\n(9) Signal transduction of plant hormones (receptors for plant hormones, G protein and protein kinases)\n\n3. Photosynthesis\n(1) ATP molecules and energy\n(2) Structure and function of chloroplasts (thylakoid, stroma etc.)\n(3) Light absorption and energy conversion\n(4) Electron transport pathways and ATP synthesis in chloroplasts\n] (5) Photosynthetic carbon fixation reaction in C3 plants\n(6) Photorespiration and other carbon dioxide fixation reactions (photorespiration, C4 plant, CAM plant)","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Prints are distributed in the lecture.","assessment":"examinations 100%","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Growth and differentiation , plant hormone , metabolism , photosynthesis","office_hours":"From 11:00 to 13:00 on Tuesday","remarks_1":"H28(2016) S 13%, A 30%, B 32%, C 17%, D 5%, E 3%\nH27(2015) S 25%, A 25%, B 18%, C 10%, D 15%, E 7%\nH26(2014) S 17%, A 25%, B 17%, C 18%, D 18%, E 5%\nH25(2013) S 14%, A 25%, B 22%, C 21%, D 16%, E 3%\nH24(2012) S 12%, A 35%, B 23%, C 15%, D 15%\nH23(2011) S 22%, A 33%, B 17%, C 16%, D 12%\nH22(2010) S 17%, A 17%, B 20%, C 22%, D 24%\nH21(2009) S 29%, A 17%, B 15%, C 17%, D 22%\nH20(2008) S 30%, A 27%, B 16%, C 15%, D 12%\nH19(2007) S 28%, A 27%, B 28%, C 8%, D 8%\nH18(2006) S 15%, A 28%, B 31%, C 14%, D 12%","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"4/7/2017 8:43:47 PM","name":{"id":103,"ja":"植物生理学","en":"Plant Physiology"},"instructor":{"id":91,"ja":"金勝 一樹","en":"KANEKATSU Motoki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"農学部","category":"","department":"","semester":"前学期","course_type":"前学期","facility_affiliation":"農学部","office":"6号館410","day_period":"火3","references":""}}
