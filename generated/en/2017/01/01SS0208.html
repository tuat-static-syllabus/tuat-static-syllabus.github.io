Aesthetics means historically knowledge of ‘sensibility’, the capacity by which we catch someone or something and by which we are affected when we come across such others (such as specific person, social event or pattern of weather). And how this sensibility is important for us is what we examine in this class. Whatever job we take, it is essential for us to have a opinion that does not betray our own way of life and is not mere mixture of readymade (so-called) public opinion; therefore we need to pay more attention to faculty of sensitivity (I will speak why in class). Concretely taking up past literature and art movements, I want to explore some hints for having our own opinions based by sensibility with you!","expected_learning":"I expect you to learn the followings:\nTo tell how sensibility works and what it means on the basis of historical or modern cases and your own experience\nTo deepen your understandings about historical art and literature movements\nTo get some hints for you to become creator of broadly-meant art and literature (not only as professional artist but also creator in daily life)\n","course_schedule":"Week 1-2 (10/4, 10/18)\nIntuition, Thinking and Sensibility: Why Sensibility is Important\n　Reference book: Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason\n　　　　　　　　 Masakazu Nakai, Introduction for Aesthetics\n\nWeek 3-4 (10/25, 11/1)\nDifference and Connection between Literature and Art: Consideration from ‘Expression’ of Ancient Mankind\n　Reference: Old Testament, Genesis\n　　　　　 Raymond Williams, Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society\n\nWeek 5-6 (11/8, 11/15)\nWords: 1910, Liberation of Sense for ‘Blue Stockings(SEITOH)’ Women after Treason Incident\n\nWeek 7-10 (11/22, 11/29, 12/6, 12/13)\nSound: Music as a Vessel for Sorrow: History of Christian Church Music and Passion\n　Reference CD: J.
