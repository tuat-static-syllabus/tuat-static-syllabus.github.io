Since electromagnetic wave can be described as the oscillation of both the electric field and magnetic field, the fundamental understanding of electromagnetism will deepen.","expected_learning":"(1) Understand the usage the law about fundamental electric field and magnetic field.\n(2) Understand that the electromagnetic wave is expressed by oscillation of both the electric field and magnetic field.\n(3) Understand that a natural phenomenon is expressed in a numerical formula.\n","course_schedule":"Week 1: Guidance (introduction about the position of this lesson in Electromagnetism)\nWeek 2: What is the electromagnetic wave?\nWeek 3: Electric field and magnetic field\nWeek 4: Gauss’s law for electric field\nWeek 5: How to use Gauss’s law for electric field (how to derive electric field and potential)\nWeek 6: Gauss’s law for magnetism and differential form of the Gauss’s law\nWeek 7: Magnetic field generated by an electric current (Biot-Savart law and Ampere’s law)\nWeek 8: How to use Biot-Savart law and Ampere's law (magnetic field of a solenoid)\nWeek 9: Faraday's law of induction\nWeek 10: Maxwell-Ampere's equation (extension of Ampere's law)\nWeek 11: Differential form Maxwell’s equations\nWeek 12: Maxwell’s equations and electromagnetic waves\nWeek 13: Property of electromagnetic waves\nWeek 14: Electromagnetic waves from the universe\nWeek 15: Term-end-examination\n","prerequisites":"Review and development of the field of the electromagnetic studied in the first year’s \"physics.\"","texts_and_materials":"Textbook used in the first year’s “physics”","assessment":"Report and reaction paper at each time (40%) and a term-end-examination (60%)","message_from_instructor":"Please taste the fun using the numerical formula.","course_keywords":"Electromagnetism, electromagnetic wave","office_hours":"kazumi（＊）tc4.so-net.ne.jp","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"Japanese","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/15/2017 1:36:47 PM","name":{"id":311,"ja":"電磁気学","en":"Electromagnetics"},"instructor":{"id":308,"ja":"浅井 和美","en":"ASAI Kazumi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":13,"min":2},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"general education courses","department":"","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Agriculture","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Wed.3","references":"Textbooks with the title of “Electromagnetism”"}}
