In addition, original habits tend to be changed in process of distribute from mountains to urban habitat through suburb, experiencing habitat fragmentation, may facilitating evolutionary responses to novel environment “urban”. Not only in animals, humans in urban environment also clearly diverse in lifestyles, provisioning food, changed climate, animal right/welfare, etc. These makes us to wonder the urban carnivore’s surprising shifts in tolerance of humans. 　\n","expected_learning":"To look at urban environment through a family Carnivora, I appreciate if it is fruitful to experience animal social system and ecology as science, as well as conservation ecology as one of field science in TUAT.","course_schedule":"","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"3/22/2017 1:46:29 PM","name":{"id":298,"ja":"農学基礎ゼミ","en":"Basic Seminar of Agricultural Science"},"instructor":{"id":275,"ja":"金子 弥生","en":"KANEKO Yayoi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":12,"min":1},"neutral_department":"Faculty of Agriculture","category":"general education courses","department":"Biological Production, Applied Biological Science, Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences, Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine","semester":"Spring","course_type":"Spring","facility_affiliation":"Faculty of Agriculture","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Thu.2","references":""}}
