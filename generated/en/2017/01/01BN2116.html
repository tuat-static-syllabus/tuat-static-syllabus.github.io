On the other hand, our body often elicits immune responses to harmless substances such as pollen and even our tissues. What is the difference between normal and abnormal responses? We discuss the mechanism to distinguish them.","expected_learning":"(1) Able to explain different compartments and roles of immune competent cells. (2) Able to understand and explain interaction between immune cells, and a way of ultimate immune responses.
