This class will learn balance of mass and heat, basic theory of transfer phenomena ( ex. flow, heat transfer, diffusion), kinetics of chemical reaction and sterilization in foods, and fundamental of food refrigeration.","expected_learning":"General goal of this class is to understand the principle of continuous thermal sterilization process for liquid foods such as milk. To achieve this, followings should be cleared.\n1) To calculate the balance of mass and heat in food manufacturing process\n2) To understand various forces acting on food and explain flow of running fluids in a circular pipe\n3) To understand three heat transfer modes and explain temperature change of solid or liquid foods when they are heated.\n4) To understand the kinetics of sterilization and calculate simple sterilization problem\n5) To understand the fundamentals of food refrigeration\n","course_schedule":"Week 1 Class outline, the role of engineering in food manufacturing\nWeek 2 Unit and dimension, mass balance (1)\nWeek 3 Mass balance (2)\nWeek 4 Heat balance\nWeek 5 Heat transfer modes (conduction, convection, radiation)\nWeek 6 Heat conduction; steady and unsteady\nWeek 7 Details of heat exchanger\nWeek 8 Kinetics of sterilization\nWeek 9 heat sterilization; equipment and operation\nWeek 10 Fundamentals of freezing and thawing\nWeek 11 Details of equipment for freezing and thawing\nWeek 12 Food processing techniques utilizing freezing and thawing\nWeek 13 Leading-edge technologies in food refrigeration; glassification and antifreeze protein (AFP)\nWeek 14 Utilization of enzyme; production process of isomerized sugar\nWeek 15 General discussion and wrap-up","prerequisites":"Taking the class of Food chemistry I&II and Food manufacturing is recommended as related classes.","texts_and_materials":"Handouts will be provided at each lecture.","assessment":"Reporting assignment (several times): 60%, Quiz at class: 40%\nGrading record last year: S 20%, A 80%\n","message_from_instructor":"The contents of this class is important and fudamental for not only food manufacturing process but also chemical and biological productions. To promote better understanding we will try including practice for solving basic problems as best as we can. We hope reviewing the class by utilizing assignments for many times will assist your understanding.
