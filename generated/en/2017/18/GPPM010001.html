In this course, social impacts and significance of scientific research are discussed in the context of agricultural sciences. In the first part of the course, we will read and discuss a couple of good research articles or reviews on the cutting-edge research to understand the structure and selection of information in those articles. We also learn how review articles often offer new interpretations of research data, original thoughts on future prospects or useful information for deeper understanding of the subjects. The second part of the course aims to help students to write a mini-review on the recent developments in their chosen topic. There will be a general guidance on how to conduct literature search, construct an essay plan and write an article, with a particular focus on how important it is to define the concept and objectives for the articles. With the draft articles submitted by students, there will be individual or group-based discussion to polish and complete the article. As a whole, it will provide students with opportunities to see the big pictures and recognize the significance or impacts of particular research, and how to communicate it effectively with fellow scientists and non-scientists.","expected_learning":"To understand the importance of identifying the significance of published research and putting details in the right context.\nTo learn how to communicate scientific details effectively to target audiences using the appropriate language.\nTo practice writing good introductions to grab readers' attention, and constructing a good story to take the readers through to the end","course_schedule":"[Day 1 ]\n1-2: Lecture around review/research articles chosen for the class (tba)\n3: Discussion to analyse the review article critically and identify the key\nmessages and objectives of the articles.\n[Day 2]\n4-5: Lecture around review articles chosen for the class (tba), to learn about the concepts, structures\nand storylines of the articles.\n6: Discussion to learn about the structure of the review article and effective paragraph writing\n[Day 3]\n7-8: Guidance on literature search, defining concepts and building an essay plan\n[to be individually arranged]\n9-12: Individual work: Writing a mini-review\n13-15: Individual or group-based discussion (tutorials) on writing a mini-review\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Handouts provided during the class","assessment":"a mini-review article","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"Review articles, Scientific writing, Essay writing","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"English","taught_language":"","last_update":"10/6/2017 7:38:19 PM","name":{"id":1758,"ja":"Frontiers in Agricultural Research","en":"Frontiers in Agricultural Research"},"instructor":{"id":964,"ja":"安村 友紀","en":"YASUMURA Yuki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"GLOBAL PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM","category":"","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Organization for the Advancement of Education and Global Learning","office":"","day_period":"Intensive","references":""}}
