After listening to these lectures, each student will read papers and other materials in English in the pertinent fields, put what they have learned into a presentation, and deliver it. Proposing and debating problems during the lessons, students will be given an opportunity to participate in active discussion among themselves.","expected_learning":"","course_schedule":"Technological innovation has rapidly progressed in biotechnology-related fields through research in biochemistry, genetic engineering, molecular biology (engineering) and genome engineering. In this advanced course of biochemistry, focusing on research trends and analytical techniques used in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and bioinformatics, scholastic findings and circumstances of development will be integrally explained. The lectures will introduce latest research reports together with general approaches in genomics and other areas and, after these lectures, students will give their own presentations. Each student will be required to choose one or another of scholastic papers concerning elemental technologies currently in the research stage to development or practical application stages in the related fields, and read it in preparation for the presentation he or she will make in the latter half of the course. A summary of the contents of such a paper will be presented, followed by a Q&A session and discussion, which will reveal his or her level of understanding.\n\n- Research trends in genomics, proteomics and other fields\n- Current status of functional analysis based on all genome information\n- Outline of comprehensive protein analysis technology\n- Research trend in comprehensive protein analysis technology\n- Research trends in transcriptomical approaches based on DNA chips\n- Research trends in transcriptomical analysis\n- Commentaries on analytical techniques used in bioinformatics\n- Biochip technology in genomic and proteomic researches\n- Presentation and discussion of genomics and proteomics-related papers\n- Presentation and discussion of transcriptomics and metabolomics-related papers\n- Presentation and discussion of biochip-related paper\n","prerequisites":"Students should have basic knowledge in biochemistry, genetic engineering and molecular biology.
