Since the structure, reactions, and functionalities of the molecules are governed by the behaviors of the electrons, it is of fundamental importance to design organic materials with your eyes set on the electronic structures. Following the relevant undergraduate courses, this course discusses methodologies for examining the electronic structures and properties of organic molecules.","expected_learning":"Learners who successfully complete this course will be able to\n(1) revive their skills in microscopic physical chemistry, likely to be deteriorated during graduation research;\n(2) examine the electronic structures, stability, and reactivity of molecules with paper and a pencil;\n(3) gain a foothold for further self-study to carry out quantum chemical calculations or read through the literature of this field.\n","course_schedule":"第I部 　 有機化学とは何か\n　序章 現代化学の神話\n　2章 物質のいろいろ\n　3章 物質をつくる力\n　4章 立体化学のあけぼの\n　5章 三次元の化学\n第II部　 分子間力とは何か\n6章 分子間にはたらく力\n　7章 水素結合の分類\n　8章 弱い水素結合\n　9章 分子間力の特徴\n第III部　分子間の相互作用\n　10章 分子を分ける\n　11章 分子の性質を調べる\n　12章 分子を見分ける\n　13章 分子をつくり分ける\n第IV部 　分子間力のはたらき\n　14章 分子のかたち\n　15章 分子の旋光性\n　16章 高分子の相互作用\n\n","prerequisites":"Ability to earn the credits of quantum chemistry I･II and structural chemistry offered for the undergraduate students of organic and polymer materials chemistry (or similar courses) is necessary.","texts_and_materials":"J.
