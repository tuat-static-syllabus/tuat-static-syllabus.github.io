They will deepen their understanding of basic knowledge related to the theme, learn how to prepare a research plan, conduct experiments and put the research findings in order, and rearrange the survey contents into an overview. In this process, such criteria of scrutiny as the significance of problem solving, effectiveness of the problem solving method and the logic of configuration will be clearly defined, and guidance will be given as to how the overview is to be put together and how to deliver the presentation. Further, the presentation will be delivered orally, its contents will be discussed from a scientific point of view, and the students will learn how to understand a presented paper both affirmatively and critically to learn about the method of research presentation.","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"","assessment":"All the instructors will evaluate the presentation of research findings and the research","message_from_instructor":"","course_keywords":"","office_hours":"","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"English","last_update":"4/12/2017 6:36:57 PM","name":{"id":1525,"ja":"先進健康科学計画研究","en":"Planning and Research for Advanced Health Science"},"instructor":{"id":471,"ja":"田中 剛","en":"TANAKA Tsuyoshi"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"生物システム応用科学府博士後期","category":"後期専門科目","department":"生物システム応用科学府博士","semester":"前学期","course_type":"前学期","facility_affiliation":"工学部","office":"","day_period":"卒研・卒論","references":""}}
