The course will be divided into two parts.In the first part of the course, students will study about the characteristicfeatures of high-quality international conference presentations in terms ofintended audience, purpose, organization, flow, style, and delivery. Studentswill also learn to how to adopt effective presentation skills, visualizationtechniques, and language patterns to present their specialist work in a powerfuland effective way. In the second part of the course, students will plan anddeliver a short research presentation describing their current work following atypical conference presentation format. As part of the presentation planningprocess, students will learn how to paraphrase, cite, and reference previous work,explain simple and extended concepts in their field, describe their methods andprocesses, introduce, explain, and hedge interpretations of data in figures andtables, and summarize their research.\n","expected_learning":"1. understand the importance of presentations and their inherent problems\n2. control nerves and deliver a presentation with confidence and authority\n3. design clear and attractive visual aids\n4. identify the audience, purpose, organization, flow, style, and delivery of presentations\n5. deliver a presentation from notes with comprehensible pronunciation\n6. use natural-sounding linking phrases and expressions when navigating and explaining presentation content\n7. understand how to deal with questions from the audience\n8. learn how to cite and reference presentation resources and data","course_schedule":"In preparation for the course, you will need to prepare some research content (i.e., background references, methods descriptions, figures/tables of results, etc.) that you can develop into slides (e.g., PowerPoint or Keynote slides) during the three days of the course.

One option for the content is to bring the materials you used to prepare the final paper for the summer intensive course in technical writing that many of you attended. However, you may also bring more recent content if you want. Please note that during the course, there will be no time to *create content*. Rather, we will be taking your already completed content and redesigning it into bullet points, simplified figures/tables, and summary slides.\n\nA basic tutorial on the use of presentation software (Microsoft PowerPoint) will be given, although prior knowledge of such software is desired.\nDay 1 (February 2, 2018 - Friday)\nIntroduction and Basic Principles of Presenting in Science and Engineering:\nThe importance of presentations; Controlling nerves in front of an audience; Audience, Purpose, Organization, Flow, Style, Delivery\n[Self-learning activities: watching authentic scientific and engineering presentations; evaluating a presentation in a specialized field; ]\nEffective Strategies for Delivering Clear and Powerful Presentations:\nEffective use of hardware and software; Slide design; Useful expressions for explaining and linking slides\n[Self-learning activities: explaining and recording a presentation; analyzing strengths and weaknesses]\n\n\nDay 2 (February 3, 2018 - Saturday)\nThe language of presentations (part 1):\nExplaining the title, outline, introduction, and conclusion\n[Self-learning activities: designing and practicing the main sections of a research presentation]\nThe language of presentations (part 2):\nExplaining the methods and results\n[Self-learning activities: designing and practicing the methods and results sections of a research presentation]\n\n\nDay 3 (February 4, 2018 - Sunday)\nThe language of presentations (part 3):\nHandling the Q&A of a presentation\n[Self-learning activities: watching Q&A sessions, practicing answering impossible questions]\nIntroduction to poster presentation design and delivery techniques\n[Self-learning activities: designing a poster, explaining the main points, responding to questions and comments]\nFinal Presentations\n[Self-learning activities: analyzing final presentations, looking for improvements]","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"Course materials will be distributed in the first lesson.","assessment":"Students are required to work individually or in groups, and give a series presentations of increasing sophistication in English during the span of the course.
