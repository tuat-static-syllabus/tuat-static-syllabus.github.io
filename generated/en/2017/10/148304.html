More specifically, they will gain understanding of the flows of genes, nuclear transcription factors and signal transmitting molecules relevant to frequently occurring diseases, including allergic troubles and cancer, and signals of cell survival and propagation, and will be taught about control molecules (incuding antibodies and signal inhibitors) working on these factors as specific targets.","expected_learning":"Understanding of principles of molecular pathology and molecule-targeting therapy against cancer and allergy.","course_schedule":"1) Molecular control of life or death of molecules I\n2) Activation signal of cells I\n3) Classification of allergic reactions\n4) Control of allergic reactions\n5) Cancer genes and cancer suppressor genes\n6) Propagation mechanism of cancer cells\n7) Immortalization mechanism of cancer cells\n\n","prerequisites":"","texts_and_materials":"L-E C.
