We will analyze some traditional BP formats to understand the structure, meaning, and writing tips. Without such knowledge, prevalence of new ideas and technology or development of economy will not be achieved; commercialization of technology and ideas is a process that presents many challenges to overcome not only for individuals but also companies.\nThis course is designed to allow students to obtain the knowledge of BPs and business models and to learn methods to create new ideas. Additionally, students will gain experience in creating a BP on a new product or a new business in a simulated setting of a partner company through realistic examples. (Students are required to create a BP proposal of a new product or a new business and present it to the management of the company.) Students are expected to not just understand traditional, typical and systematized BPs but learn a BP of a new style and structure through experience in a case with the real company. The course should provide an opportunity for students to come up with a strategic BP.\n<Notes>\n- In the first seven classes of this course, we will lean about the strategic BP through lectures and the case method based on specific examples. The subsequent eight classes of the course will provide the students with an opportunity to create a BP for a real company.\n- The second half of the course will be in the form of Project Based Learning (PBL) with cooperation from the company.\n- Students who wish to take this course are expected to meet with personnel from the partner company with respect, maintain confidentiality of the company's information, and never cause any trouble to the company.\n- Students are also expected to attend all classes in principle and be willing to work outside the class hours (to do homework, survey, etc.). This is because the students will be divided into small groups for the PBL, where teamwork is the key. Unexcused absence or unfinished homework will hinder other members of the team from learning.","expected_learning":"- Understand concepts such as marketing, resource analysis, competitive advantage, business models, return on investment, and implementation system on the basis of the actual case of the partner company.\n- Tackle various management issues by utilizing all the knowledge learned in the course, and understand methods to create new ideas.","course_schedule":"The 1st class [Orientation] Description of course planning, general discussion on BP, etc.\n\nThe 2nd class [Lecture] Method of analyzing environment of companies, method of analyzing company resource, etc.\n\nThe 3rd class [Lecture] How to create ideas, how to utilize intellectual property information, etc.\n\nThe 4th class [Lecture] How to make a business model, initiative and entry barriers, etc.\n\nThe 5th class [Lecture] Investment versus effect, how to make financial plans, implementation system, etc.\n\nThe 6th class [Case Method] Analysis of specific cases of small-to-medium sized companies (part 1), contracts and business plans, etc.\n\nThe 7th class [Case Method] Analysis of specific cases of small-to-medium sized companies (Part 2), competitive advantage, etc.\n\nThe 8th class [Presentation from partner company] Company outline, business outline, explanation of management issues, Q&A <with the attendance of the management of the partner company>\n\nThe 9th class [Group work] Group formation, organization of information of the partner company, understanding of issues, etc.\n\nThe 10th class [Group work] Analysis of the environment of the partner company, identification of competitiveness, etc.\n\nThe 11th class [Intermediate presentation] Information organization and progress report, feedback etc.\n\nThe 12th class [Group work] Creating ideas to be proposed, creating BP plans, etc.\n\nThe 13th class [Intermediate presentation] Presentation of proposed ideas, explanation of BP, feedback, etc.\n\nThe 14th class [Group work] Revision and revisit of BP, finalization of proposals, etc.\n\nThe 15th class [Final Presentation] Presentation of BP for the partner company, evaluation of BP <with the attendance of the management of the partner company>\n\n* Students must attend the 8th and 15th classes because of the attendance from the partner company.","prerequisites":"- Students interested in development of new products and the startup of a new business\n- Engineers or consultants who wish to improve the business acumen","texts_and_materials":"- To be distributed during the class in principle","assessment":"Comments on the presented BP 40%, contribution to the class (questions and comments during the class, etc.) 30%, attendance and reports 30%","message_from_instructor":"Results of PBL vary significantly depending on partner companies and group work, which poses uncertainties but is also a source of great fun.
