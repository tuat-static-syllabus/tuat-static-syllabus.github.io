Actually in any innovations, you should provide products and/or services embodied what customers would like to use. Innovation might be succeeded if its products and services could grab the interest of many users, protecting from a variety of risks, and making continuous efforts to spread its value. In that process, using related standards appropriately, developing or modifying standards as needed are one of important activities,.\nThis course aims that you could get one of basic business skills how to put standards to practical use, studying what kind of effects or roles standards have in the market through practices to apply standards to your research theme. What you would have learned here will help you hunt a job, work effectively and draw a business story that you want to achieve.","expected_learning":"It is the target that you could understand how to figure out standards needed and use them effectively with considering below in the process that provides products and services to the market.\n1) Setting value to provide and targets who receive the value\n2) Protecting them from a variety of risks\nBusiness process from development, procurement, production to delivery","course_schedule":"How fantastic if I could trigger an innovation! Everybody may think so. Sorry to say that an innovation is not easy. What are needed for an innovation? Then you might think you would like to concrete a base of your idea, and accelerate and spread its movement to be an innovation. Now there are standards as one of the tools to do those.\nEvery innovation has a purpose providing some sort of intended value. In order to embody the purpose, you should firstly decide a goal to achieve and people to contribute, and secondly figure out the value providing process to achieve the goal. At last you make sure what standards are needed in the process. You research adaptable standards within published standards, but you could not find those standards. So you will study how to use those standards that might contribute to be an innovation what you intend. However, you cannot do series of these works without background knowledge of standards, and have difficulty to consider alone what you should do. Therefore it is also important to refer to or incorporate opinions of others.\nWith this in mind, using topics and recent cases as much as possible, lectures would be carried out with introducing standards related to the research themes of students. Lectures set some brief discussion appropriately, so that for each theme of their own / others, you confirm goals and objectives, and could dug out and grasp some required standard, an important standard, a standard that are missing. Through these experiences, you can learn positive attitude to accept advice from others or to provide to others.\n\n(* Note: lecture is held on Friday normally, but 14th is held on 1/22)\n1st 10/06 (Fri. 6th period) Introduction\n2nd 10/13 (Fri. 6th period) Standardization of roles and issues for business\n3rd 10/20 (Fri. 6th period) Standards refer to achievement of research\n4th 10/27 (Fri. 6th period) Case 1 Standardization for hardware, material, software\n5th 11/3 (Fri. 6th period) Case 2 Standardization for hardware, material, software\n6th 11/17 (Fri. 6th period) Case 3 Standardization for hardware, material, software\n(Introduce each student research theme and its purpose)\n7th 11/24(Fri. 6th period) Safety, Environment\n8th 12/1(Fri. 6th period) EMC (Electromagnetic compatibility)\n9th 12/8(Fri. 6th period) Cybersecurity\n10th 12/15(Fri. 6th period) Trade, Counterfeit\n(Explain risks for each research theme)\n11th 12/22(Fri. 6th period) Standards needed for development products\n12th 1/5(Fri. 6th period) Standards needed to distribute information refer to design\n13th 1/19 (Fri. 6th period) Standards for life-cycle of products\n*14th 1/22(Mon. 6th period) Standardization process and contents of standard\n15th 1/26(Fri. 6th period) Presentation of each report","prerequisites":"To be able to make out reports by presentation tool","texts_and_materials":"Materials using in lecture","assessment":"Results are evaluated on a five level scale in a comprehensive manner, in consideration of issues report mainly and contribution to the discussion in the lecture etc.\nS:superior A:excellent B:normal C:passing D:failing\nAttendance of less than 70% is given D level.","message_from_instructor":"It is required to bring awareness why you want to learn and think how you can use the knowledge gained.","course_keywords":"Standard, standardization , conformity assessment, certification, innovation, risk, ISO, IEC","office_hours":"Questions and consultations are accepted anytime by email.","remarks_1":"","remarks_2":"","related_url":"","course_language":"","taught_language":"","last_update":"9/27/2017 10:36:07 AM","name":{"id":1277,"ja":"工業技術標準概論","en":"Industrial Technology Standards"},"instructor":{"id":873,"ja":"岡本 秀樹","en":"OKAMOTO Hideki"},"present_lang":{"id":2,"lang_name":"English","lang_code":"en"},"grades":{"id":11},"neutral_department":"Graduate School of Engineering","category":"The Professional Degree Program of Industrial Technology and Innovation","department":"","semester":"Fall","course_type":"Fall","facility_affiliation":"Graduate School of Engineering","office":"BASE 223","day_period":"Fri.6","references":"“Open and Close strategy ?
